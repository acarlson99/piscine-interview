The First Book of @:  Called Genesis


1:1 In the beginning God created the @1s and the @.

1:2 And the @ was @S form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
@Zs.

1:3 And God said, Let @ be light: and @ was light.

1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And God @, the light Day, and the darkness he @, Night.
And the evening and the morning were the @O day.

1:6 And God said, Let @ be a firmament in the @a of the @Zs,
and let it divide the @Zs from the @Zs.

1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the @Zs @ were
@[ the firmament from the @Zs @ were above the firmament:
and it was so.

1:8 And God @, the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.

1:9 And God said, Let the @Zs @[ the @1 be ga@d @?
unto one @', and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

1:10 And God @, the dry land Earth; and the gathering @? of
the @Zs @, he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

1:11 And God said, Let the @ @( @ grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit @ his kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the @: and it was so.

1:12 And the @ @ @ grass, and herb yielding seed @
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, @
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

1:14 And God said, Let @ be lights in the firmament of the @1
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and @8: 1:15 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the @1 to give light upon the @: and it was
so.

1:16 And God made two @ lights; the @er light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the @1 to give light
upon the @, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and
to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:20 And God said, Let the @Zs @( @ abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the @ in the
open firmament of @1.

1:21 And God created @ whales, and @ living creature that
moveth, @ the @Zs @ @ abundantly, @ @ kind,
and @ winged fowl @ his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:22 And God blessed them, @, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the @Zs in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the @.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And God said, Let the @ @( @ the living creature @
his kind, cattle, and creeping @7, and beast of the @ @ his
kind: and it was so.

1:25 And God made the beast of the @ @ his kind, and cattle
@ @ kind, and @ @7 that creepeth upon the @ @
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, @ our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the @, and over
@ creeping @7 that creepeth upon the @.

1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the @, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over @
living @7 that moveth upon the @.

1:29 And God said, @., I have @= you @ herb bearing seed,
@ is upon the face of all the @, and @ tree, in the @
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it @ be for meat.

1:30 And to @ beast of the @, and to @ fowl of the air,
and to @ @7 that creepeth upon the @, wherein @ is
life, I have @= @ green herb for meat: and it was so.

1:31 And God saw @ @7 that he had made, and, @%, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

2:1 Thus the @1s and the @ were finished, and all the host of
them.

2:2 And on the @Hth day God ended his work @ he had made; and
he rested on the @Hth day from all his work @ he had made.

2:3 And God blessed the @Hth day, and sanctified it: @ that
in it he had rested from all his work @ God created and made.

2:4 These are the generations of the @1s and of the @ when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the @ and the
@1s, 2:5 And @ plant of the field @	 it was in the @,
and @ herb of the field @	 it grew: for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the @, and @ was not a man to till the
ground.

2:6 But @ went up a mist from the @, and @Zed the whole
face of the ground.

2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and @ he
put the man whom he had formed.

2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow @ tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
@a of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

2:10 And a river went out of Eden to @Z the garden; and from thence
it was parted, and became into four heads.

2:11 The name of the @O is Pison: that is it @ compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where @ is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that
land is good: @ is bdellium and the onyx stone.

2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it @
goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.

2:16 And the LORD God @M the man, @, Of @ tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou @ not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest @of thou @ surely die.

2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man @# be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed @ beast of the
field, and @ fowl of the air; and @ them unto Adam to see
what he @L call them: and whatsoever Adam @, @ living
creature, that was the name @of.

2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
and to @ beast of the field; but for Adam @ was not @V an
help meet for him.

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the @R instead
@of; 2:22 And the rib, @ the LORD God had taken from man, made
he a woman, and @ her unto the man.

2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and @R of my
@R: she @ be @, Woman, @ she was taken out of Man.

2:24 @N @ a man leave his @ and his m@C, and @
cleave unto his wife: and they @ be one @R.

2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field @
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye @ not eat of @ tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said
unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree @ is in the @a of the garden,
God hath said, Ye @ not eat of it, @" @ ye touch it, lest
ye die.

3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye @ not surely die: 3:5
For God doth know that in the day ye eat @of, then your eyes @
be opened, and ye @ be as gods, knowing good and evil.

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit @of, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.

3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves @?, and made @T
aprons.

3:8 And they @) the @; of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid @T from the
presence of the LORD God @st the trees of the garden.

3:9 And the LORD God @, unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?  3:10 And he said, I @) thy @; in the garden, and I was
afraid, @ I was naked; and I hid myself.

3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I @M thee that thou @#est not eat?
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above @ beast of the
field; upon thy belly @ thou go, and dust @ thou eat all the
days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it @ bruise thy head,
and thou @ bruise his heel.

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will @ly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou @ @( @ @; and thy
desire @ be to thy husband, and he @ rule over thee.

3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the @;
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of @ I @M thee,
@, Thou @ not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow @ thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles @ it @( @ to thee; and thou @ eat the
herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face @ thou eat @d,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust @ thou return.

3:20 And Adam @, his wife's name Eve; @ she was the m@C
of all living.

3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.

3:22 And the LORD God said, @., the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil: and now, lest he put @ his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 @N the
LORD God sent him @ from the garden of Eden, to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

3:24 So he drove out the man; and he @'d at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming @Q @ turned @ way, to keep
the way of the tree of life.

4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she @* bare his @X Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain @ of the
fruit of the ground an @& unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also @ of the @Olings of his flock and of
the fat @of. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
@&: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his @& he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, @ thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee @ be his desire, and thou @ rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his @X: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up @
 Abel his @X,
and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy @X? And he
said, I know not: Am I my @X's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the @; of thy @X's @I crieth unto me from
the ground.

4:11 And now art thou cursed from the @, @ hath opened her
@P to receive thy @X's @I from thy hand; 4:12 When thou
tillest the ground, it @ not hence@ yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond @ thou be in the @.

4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is @er than I can
bear.

4:14 @., thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
@; and from thy face @ I be hid; and I @ be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the @; and it @ come to pass, that @ one
that findeth me @ slay me.

4:15 And the LORD said unto him, @N whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance @ be taken on him @Hfold. And the LORD set a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him @# kill him.

4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
builded a city, and @, the name of the city, @ the name of his
son, Enoch.

4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
and the name of the @C Zillah.

4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the @ of such as dwell in tents,
and of such as have cattle.

4:21 And his @X's name was Jubal: he was the @ of all such
as handle the harp and organ.

4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of @
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my @;;
ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

4:24 If Cain @ be avenged @Hfold, truly Lamech @Hty and
@Hfold.

4:25 And Adam knew his wife @*; and she bare a son, and @, his
name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me @F seed instead
of Abel, whom Cain slew.

4:26 And to Seth, to him also @ was born a son; and he @, his
name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female
created he them; and blessed them, and @, @ name Adam, in the
day when they were created.

5:3 And Adam lived an @/ and thirty @8, and begat a son in his

5:9 And Enos lived ninety @8, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived
@ he begat Cainan eight @/ and fifteen @8, and begat sons
and daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine @/ and

5:12 And Cainan lived @Hty @8 and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And
Cainan lived @ he begat Mahalaleel eight @/ and forty @8,
and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were

5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five @8, and begat Jared: 5:16
And Mahalaleel lived @ he begat Jared eight @/ and thirty

Mahalaleel were eight @/ ninety and five @8: and he died.

5:18 And Jared lived an @/ sixty and two @8, and he begat

and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine

5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five @8, and begat Methuselah: 5:22
And Enoch walked with God @ he begat Methuselah @@ @/
@8, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch
were @@ @/ sixty and five @8: 5:24 And Enoch walked with
God: and he was not; for God took him.

5:25 And Methuselah lived an @/ eighty and @H @8, and begat
Lamech.

5:26 And Methuselah lived @ he begat Lamech @H @/ eighty
and two @8, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of
Methuselah were nine @/ sixty and nine @8: and he died.

5:28 And Lamech lived an @/ eighty and two @8, and begat a
son: 5:29 And he @, his name Noah, @, This same @ comfort
us concerning our work and toil of our @D, @ of the ground
@ the LORD hath cursed.

5:30 And Lamech lived @ he begat Noah five @/ ninety and five
@8, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech
were @H @/ @Hty and @H @8: and he died.

5:32 And Noah was five @/ @8 old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
and Japheth.

6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
@, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw
the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of
all @ they chose.

6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit @ not always strive with man, for
that he also is @R: yet his days @ be an @/ and twenty
@8.

6:4 There were giants in the @ in @J days; and also @ that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
@ to them, the same became @By men @ were of old, men of
renown.

6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was @ in the @, and
that @ imagination of the thoughts of his @ was only evil
continually.

6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the @, and it
grieved him at his @.

6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the @; both man, and beast, and the creeping @7, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

6:8 But Noah @V grace in the eyes of the LORD.

6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

6:10 And Noah begat @@ sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

6:11 The @ also was corrupt @	 God, and the @ was filled
with violence.

6:12 And God looked upon the @, and, @%, it was corrupt; for
all @R had corrupted his way upon the @.

6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all @R is come @	 me;
for the @ is filled with violence @E them; and, @%, I
will destroy them with the @.

6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms @ thou make in the
ark, and @ pitch it within and @S with pitch.

6:15 And this is the fashion @ thou @ make it of: The length

6:16 A window @ thou make to the ark, and in a cubit @ thou

@of; with lower, second, and third stories @ thou make it.

6:17 And, @%, I, even I, do @( a flood of @Zs upon the

@1; and @ @7 that is in the @ @ die.

6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou @ come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives
with thee.

6:19 And of @ living @7 of all @R, two of @ sort @

male and female.

6:20 Of fowls @ @ kind, and of cattle @ @ kind, of

6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou @
gather it to thee; and it @ be for food for thee, and for them.

6:22 Thus did Noah; @$ to all that God @M him, so did
he.

7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy @ into the
ark; for thee have I seen @ceous @	 me in this generation.

7:2 Of @ clean beast thou @ take to thee by @Hs, the male
and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female.

7:3 Of fowls also of the air by @Hs, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the @.

7:4 For yet @H days, and I will cause it to rain upon the @
forty days and forty nights; and @ living substance that I have
made will I destroy from off the face of the @.

7:5 And Noah did @$ unto all that the LORD @M him.

7:6 And Noah was six @/ @8 old when the flood of @Zs was
upon the @.

7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
with him, into the ark, @ of the @Zs of the flood.

7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
and of @ @7 that creepeth upon the @, 7:9 There went in two
and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had
@M Noah.

7:10 And it came to pass @ @H days, that the @Zs of the
flood were upon the @.

7:11 In the six @/th year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the @Hteenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the @ deep broken up, and the windows of @1 were opened.

7:12 And the rain was upon the @ forty days and forty nights.

7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the @@ wives of his sons
with them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and @ beast @ his kind,
and all the cattle @ @ kind, and @ creeping @7 that
creepeth upon the @ @ his kind, and @ fowl @ his kind,
@ bird of @ sort.

7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
@R, wherein is the breath of life.

7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all @R, as
God had @M him: and the LORD shut him in.

7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the @; and the @Zs
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the @.

7:18 And the @Zs prevailed, and were increased @ly upon the

7:19 And the @Zs prevailed exceedingly upon the @; and all the
high hills, that were @[ the whole @1, were covered.

7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the @Zs prevail; and the mountains
were covered.

7:21 And all @R died that moved upon the @, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of @ creeping @7 that creepeth
upon the @, and @ man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.

7:23 And @ living substance was destroyed @ was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping @, and the
fowl of the @1; and they were destroyed from the @: and Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

7:24 And the @Zs prevailed upon the @ an @/ and fifty
days.

8:1 And God remembered Noah, and @ living @7, and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over
the @, and the @Zs asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep
and the windows of @1 were stopped, and the rain from @1 was
restrained; 8:3 And the @Zs returned from off the @
continually: and @ the end of the @/ and fifty days the
@Zs were abated.

8:4 And the ark rested in the @Hth month, on the @Hteenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

8:5 And the @Zs decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
tenth month, on the @O day of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.

8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
window of the ark @ he had made: 8:7 And he sent @ a raven,
@ went @ to and fro, until the @Zs were dried up from off
the @.

8:8 Also he sent @ a dove from him, to see if the @Zs were
abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove @V no rest
for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for
the @Zs were on the face of the whole @: then he put @ his
hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

8:10 And he stayed yet @C @H days; and @* he sent @ the
dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, lo, in her @P was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that
the @Zs were abated from off the @.

8:12 And he stayed yet @C @H days; and sent @ the dove;
@ returned not @* unto him any more.

8:13 And it came to pass in the six @/th and @O year, in the
@O month, the @O day of the month, the @Zs were dried up from
off the @: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
and, @%, the face of the ground was dry.

8:14 And in the second month, on the @H and twentieth day of the
month, was the @ dried.

8:15 And God @0 unto Noah, @, 8:16 Go @ of the ark, thou,
and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

8:17 Bring @ with thee @ living @7 that is with thee, of
all @R, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of @ creeping @7
that creepeth upon the @; that they may breed abundantly in the
@, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the @.

8:18 And Noah went @, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, @ creeping @7, and @
fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the @, @ @ kinds, went
@ out of the ark.

8:20 And Noah builded an @\ unto the LORD; and took of @ clean
beast, and of @ clean fowl, and offered @_ @&s on the
@\.

8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
@, I will not @* curse the ground any more for man's sake; for
the imagination of man's @ is evil from his youth; @" will I
@* smite any more @ @7 living, as I have done.

8:22 While the @ remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night @ not cease.

9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be

9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you @ be upon @ beast
of the @, and upon @ fowl of the air, upon all that moveth

9:3 Every moving @7 that liveth @ be meat for you; even as the

9:4 But @R with the life @of, @ is the @I @of, @

9:5 And surely your @I of your lives will I require; at the hand of

9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's @I, by man @ his @I be shed: for in

9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; @( @ abundantly in

9:8 And God @0 unto Noah, and to his sons with him, @, 9:9 And
I, @%, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed @

9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, @" @ all

9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant @ I make

perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it @
be for a token of a covenant between me and the @.

9:14 And it @ come to pass, when I @( a cloud over the @,

9:16 And the bow @ be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that

9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, @
I have established between me and all @R that is upon the @.

9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went @ of the ark, were Shem, and
Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the @ of Canaan.

9:19 These are the @@ sons of Noah: and of them was the whole @
overspread.

9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent.

9:22 And Ham, the @ of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his @,
and told his two @3 @S.

9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both @
@#ers, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of @
@; and @ faces were backward, and they saw not @ @'s
nakedness.

9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.

9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a @< of @<s @ he be

9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan @ be

9:27 God @ enlarge Japheth, and he @ dwell in the tents of

9:28 And Noah lived @ the flood @@ @/ and fifty @8.

9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine @/ and fifty @8: and
he died.

10:1 Now @ are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth: and unto them were sons born @ the flood.

10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
Dodanim.

10:5 By @ were the isles of the Gentiles divided in @ lands;
@ one @ his tongue, @ @ families, in @ nations.

10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a @By one in the @.

10:9 He was a @By hunter @	 the LORD: wherefore it is said,
Even as Nimrod the @By hunter @	 the LORD.

10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

10:11 Out of that land went @ Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:
the same is a @ city.

10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
Caphtorim.

10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his @O born, and Heth, 10:16 And the
Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,
and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the
Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and @ward were the families of the
Canaanites spread abroad.

10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest
to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

10:20 These are the sons of Ham, @ @ families, @ @
tongues, in @ countries, and in @ nations.

10:21 Unto Shem also, the @ of all the @ of Eber, the
@X of Japheth the elder, even to him were @ born.

10:22 The @ of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
and Aram.

10:23 And the @ of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for
in his days was the @ divided; and his @X's name was Joktan.

10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
Jerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and
Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all @
were the sons of Joktan.

10:30 And @ dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
mount of the east.

10:31 These are the sons of Shem, @ @ families, @ @
tongues, in @ lands, @ @ nations.

10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, @ @
generations, in @ nations: and by @ were the nations divided
in the @ @ the flood.

11:1 And the whole @ was of one language, and of one speech.

11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
@V a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt @.

11:3 And they said one to @F, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
morter.

11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
top may reach unto @1; and let us make us a name, lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole @.

11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, @ the
@ of men builded.

11:6 And the LORD said, @., the @ is one, and they have all
one language; and this they begin to do: and now no@7 will be
restrained from them, @ they have imagined to do.

11:7 Go to, let us go down, and @ con@V @ language, that
they may not @[stand one @F's speech.

11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the @: and they left off to build the city.

11:9 @N is the name of it @, Babel; @ the LORD did
@ con@V the language of all the @: and from thence did the
LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the @.

11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an @/ @8
old, and begat Arphaxad two @8 @ the flood: 11:11 And Shem
lived @ he begat Arphaxad five @/ @8, and begat sons and

11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty @8, and begat Salah: 11:13
And Arphaxad lived @ he begat Salah four @/ and @@ @8,
and begat sons and daughters.

11:14 And Salah lived thirty @8, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah
lived @ he begat Eber four @/ and @@ @8, and begat sons

11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty @8, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And
Eber lived @ he begat Peleg four @/ and thirty @8, and
begat sons and daughters.

11:18 And Peleg lived thirty @8, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg
lived @ he begat Reu two @/ and nine @8, and begat sons

11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty @8, and begat Serug: 11:21 And
Reu lived @ he begat Serug two @/ and @H @8, and begat
sons and daughters.

11:22 And Serug lived thirty @8, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug
lived @ he begat Nahor two @/ @8, and begat sons and

11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty @8, and begat Terah: 11:25
And Nahor lived @ he begat Terah an @/ and nineteen @8,
and begat sons and daughters.

11:26 And Terah lived @Hty @8, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
Haran.

11:27 Now @ are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

11:28 And Haran died @	 his @ Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of
Haran, the @ of Milcah, and the @ of Iscah.

11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they
went @ with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of
Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt @.

11:32 And the days of Terah were two @/ and five @8: and Terah
died in Haran.

12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy @'s @, unto a land that I
will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a @ nation, and I
will bless thee, and make thy name @; and thou @ be a
blessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him
that curseth thee: and in thee @ all families of the @ be
blessed.

12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him: and Abram was @Hty and five @8 old when he departed
out of Haran.

12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his @X's son, and all
@ substance that they had ga@d, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went @ to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they came.

12:6 And Abram passed @E the land unto the @' of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land: and @ builded he an @\ unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.

12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:
and @ he builded an @\ unto the LORD, and @, upon the name
of the LORD.

12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

12:10 And @ was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
@- to sojourn @; for the famine was grievous in the land.

12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into @-,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, @. now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon: 12:12 @N it @ come to pass, when
the @-ians @ see thee, that they @ say, This is his wife:
and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul @ live @ of thee.

12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into @-, the
@-ians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her @	
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's @.

12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
oxen, and he asses, and men@<s, and maid@<s, and she asses,
and camels.

12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his @ with @ plagues
@ of Sarai Abram's wife.

12:18 And Pharaoh @, Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I @B have taken her to me to
wife: now @fore @% thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

12:20 And Pharaoh @M his men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.

13:1 And Abram went up out of @-, he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.

13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
the @' where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and
Hai; 13:4 Unto the @' of the @\, @ he had make @ at the
@O: and @ Abram @, on the name of the LORD.

13:5 And Lot also, @ went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.

13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they @B dwell
@?: for @ substance was @, so that they could not dwell
@?.

13:7 And @ was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and
the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land.

13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let @ be no strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
@3.

13:9 Is not the whole land @	 thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the @c;
or if thou depart to the @c hand, then I will go to the left.

13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well @Zed @ where, @	 the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of @-,
as thou comest unto Zoar.

13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east: and they separated @T the one from the @C.

13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
@G of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners @	 the LORD
exceedingly.

13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, @ that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now @ eyes, and look from the @' where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all
the land @ thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for

13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the @: so that if a
man can number the dust of the @, then @ thy seed also be
numbered.

13:17 Arise, walk @E the land in the length of it and in the
@dth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre, @ is in Hebron, and built @ an @\ unto the LORD.

14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of
nations; 14:2 That @ made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, @ is Zoar.

14:3 All @ were joined @? in the vale of Siddim, @ is

14:4 Twelve @8 they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year

14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the
Horites in @ mount Seir, unto Elparan, @ is by the wilderness.

14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, @ is Kadesh, and
smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that

14:8 And @ went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of
Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king
of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
four kings with five.

14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell @; and they that remained fled
to the mountain.

14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all @
victuals, and went @ way.

14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's @X's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed.

14:13 And @ came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, @X of Eshcol, and
@X of Aner: and @ were confederate with Abram.

14:14 And when Abram @) that his @X was taken captive, he
armed his trained @<s, born in his own @, @@ @/ and
eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

14:15 And he divided @9 @

left hand of Damascus.

14:16 And he @ back all the goods, and also @ @* his
@X Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the @.

14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him @ his return from

the valley of Shaveh, @ is the king's dale.

14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem @ @ @d and wine: and
he was the @6 of the most high God.

14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high

tithes of all.

14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
take the goods to thyself.

14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand

14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and

15:1 After @ @ the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a

15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go

15:5 And he @ him @ abroad, and said, Look now toward
@1, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he
said unto him, So @ thy seed be.

15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
@ceousness.

15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that @ thee out of Ur
of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby @ I know that I @ inherit
it?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of @@ @8 old,
and a she goat of @@ @8 old, and a ram of @@ @8 old, and a
turtledove, and a young pigeon.

15:10 And he took unto him all @, and divided them in the @a,
and laid each piece one @
 @F: but the birds divided he not.

15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
away.

15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, lo, an horror of @ darkness fell upon him.

15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed @ be
a stranger in a land that is not @'s, and @ serve them; and
they @ afflict them four @/ @8; 15:14 And also that
nation, whom they @ serve, will I judge: and @ward @ they
come out with @ substance.

15:15 And thou @ go to thy @s in @U; thou @ be buried
in a good old age.

15:16 But in the fourth generation they @ come hither @*: for
the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
dark, @% a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between
@J pieces.

15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, @,
Unto thy seed have I @= this land, from the river of @- unto the
@ river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the
Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the
Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the
Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no @: and she had an
handmaid, an @-ian, whose name was Hagar.

16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, @. now, the LORD hath restrained
me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
obtain @ by her. And Abram hearkened to the @; of Sarai.

16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the @-ian, @
Abram had dwelt ten @8 in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her
husband Abram to be his wife.

16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have @= my
maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was
despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.

16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, @., thy maid is in @ hand; do
to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she
fled from her face.

16:7 And the angel of the LORD @V her by a fountain of @Z in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
and submit thyself @[ her @D.

16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
seed exceedingly, that it @ not be numbered for multitude.

16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, @., thou art with
child and @ bear a son, and @ call his name Ishmael; @
the LORD hath @) thy affliction.

16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be @
 @ man,
and @ man's hand @

of all his @3.

16:13 And she @, the name of the LORD that @0 unto her, Thou
God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked @ him that
seeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was @, Beerlahairoi; @%,
it is between Kadesh and Bered.

16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram @, his son's name,
@ Hagar bare, Ishmael.

16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six @8 old, when Hagar bare
Ishmael to Abram.

17:1 And when Abram was ninety @8 old and nine, the LORD appeared
to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Al@By God; walk @	 me,
and be thou perfect.

17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
multiply thee exceedingly.

17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, @, 17:4
As for me, @%, my covenant is with thee, and thou @ be a
@ of many nations.

17:5 Neither @ thy name any more be @, Abram, but thy name
@ be Abraham; for a @ of many nations have I made thee.

17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
of thee, and kings @ come out of thee.

17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
@ thee in @ generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
God unto thee, and to thy seed @ thee.

17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed @ thee, the land
wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an
everlasting possession; and I will be @ God.

17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou @ keep my covenant @fore,
thou, and thy seed @ thee in @ generations.

17:10 This is my covenant, @ ye @ keep, between me and you and
thy seed @ thee; Every man child @ you @ be circumcised.

17:11 And ye @ circumcise the @R of your foreskin; and it @
be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

17:12 And he that is eight days old @ be circumcised @ you,
@ man child in your generations, he that is born in the @, or
bought with money of any stranger, @ is not of thy seed.

17:13 He that is born in thy @, and he that is bought with thy
money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant @ be in your
@R for an everlasting covenant.

17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose @R of his foreskin is
not circumcised, that soul @ be cut off from his @; he hath
broken my covenant.

17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou @ not
call her name Sarai, but Sarah @ her name be.

17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
will bless her, and she @ be a m@C of nations; kings of @
@ be of her.

17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
@, Shall a child be born unto him that is an @/ @8 old?
and @ Sarah, that is ninety @8 old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham
said unto God, O that Ishmael @B live @	 thee!  17:19 And God
said, Sarah thy wife @ bear thee a son indeed; and thou @ call
his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant, and with his seed @ him.

17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have @) thee: @., I have blessed
him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;
twelve princes @ he beget, and I will make him a @ nation.

17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, @ Sarah @
bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
@, and all that were bought with his money, @ male @ the
men of Abraham's @; and circumcised the @R of @ foreskin in
the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

17:24 And Abraham was ninety @8 old and nine, when he was
circumcised in the @R of his foreskin.

17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen @8 old, when he was
circumcised in the @R of his foreskin.

17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
son.

17:27 And all the men of his @, born in the @, and bought with
money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes
and looked, and, lo, @@ men stood by him: and when he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed @9 toward the
ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have @V favour in thy
sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy @<: 18:4 Let a little
@Z, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
@[ the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of @d, and comfort
ye your @s; @ that ye @ pass on: for @fore are ye come
to your @<. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly @@ measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
upon the @h.

18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,
and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf @ he had dressed,
and set it @	 them; and he stood by them @[ the tree, and they
did eat.

18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
@., in the tent.

18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee @$ to the
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife @ have a son. And Sarah
@) it in the tent door, @ was behind him.

18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
ceased to be with Sarah @ the manner of women.

18:12 @N Sarah laughed within herself, @, After I am waxed
old @ I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD
said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, @, Shall I of a
surety bear a child, @ am old?  18:14 Is any @7 too hard for
the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, @$ to
the time of life, and Sarah @ have a son.

18:15 Then Sarah denied, @, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
Abraham went with them to @( them on the way.

18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that @7 @ I
do; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham @ surely become a @ and @By
nation, and all the nations of the @ @ be blessed in him?
18:19 For I know him, that he will command his @ and his
@hold @ him, and they @ keep the way of the LORD, to do
justice and judgment; that the LORD may @( upon Abraham that @
he hath spoken of him.

18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
@, and @ @ sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down
now, and see whether they have done al@? @$ to the cry of
it, @ is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

18:22 And the men turned @ faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom: but Abraham stood yet @	 the LORD.

18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
@ceous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure @ be fifty
@ceous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
@' for the fifty @ceous that are @in?  18:25 That be far
from thee to do @ this manner, to slay the @ceous with the
wicked: and that the @ceous @# be as the wicked, that be far
from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the @ do @c?  18:26 And
the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty @ceous within the city,
then I will spare all the @' for @ sakes.

18:27 And Abraham @> and said, @. now, I have taken upon me
to @K unto the LORD, @ am but dust and ashes: 18:28
Peradventure @ @ lack five of the fifty @ceous: wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find @
forty and five, I will not destroy it.

18:29 And he @0 unto him yet @*, and said, Peradventure @
@ be forty @V @. And he said, I will not do it for forty's
sake.

18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
@K: Peradventure @ @ thirty be @V @. And he said, I
will not do it, if I find thirty @.

18:31 And he said, @. now, I have taken upon me to @K unto the
LORD: Peradventure @ @ be twenty @V @. And he said, I
will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will @K yet
but this once: Peradventure ten @ be @V @. And he said, I
will not destroy it for ten's sake.

18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his @'.

19:1 And @ came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed
@9 with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, @. now,
my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your @<'s @, and tarry
all night, and wash your feet, and ye @ rise up early, and go on
your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all
night.

19:3 And he pressed upon them @ly; and they turned in unto him,
and entered into his @; and he made them a feast, and did bake
unleavened @d, and they did eat.

19:4 But @	 they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
Sodom, compassed the @ round, both old and young, all the @
from @ quarter: 19:5 And they @, unto Lot, and said unto him,
Where are the men @ came in to thee this night? @( them out
unto us, that we may know them.

19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door @
him, 19:7 And said, I pray you, @3, do not so wickedly.

19:8 @. now, I have two daughters @ have not known man; let
me, I pray you, @( them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good
in your eyes: only unto @ men do no@7; for @fore came they
@[ the shadow of my roof.

19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said @*, This one fellow
came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal
worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,
even Lot, and came near to break the door.

19:10 But the men put @ @ hand, and pulled Lot into the @
to them, and shut to the door.

19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the @ with
blindness, both small and @: so that they wearied @T to
find the door.

19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the
city, @( them out of this @': 19:13 For we will destroy this
@', @ the cry of them is waxen @ @	 the face of the
LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

19:14 And Lot went out, and @0 unto his sons in law, @ married
his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this @'; for the LORD
will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons
in law.

19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
@, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, @ are here;
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon
the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD
being merciful unto him: and they @ him @, and set him
@S the city.

19:17 And it came to pass, when they had @ them @ abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, @" stay
thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 @. now,
thy @< hath @V grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy
mercy, @ thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot
escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20
@. now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul @
live.

19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
@7 also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the @ thou
hast spoken.

19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any@7 till thou
be come thither. @N the name of the city was @, Zoar.

19:23 The sun was risen upon the @ when Lot entered into Zoar.

19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the LORD out of @1; 19:25 And he overthrew @J @G,
and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the @G, and that
@ grew upon the ground.

19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
pillar of salt.

19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the @' where he
stood @	 the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the @G of the plain,
that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the @a of the
overthrow, when he overthrew the @G in the @ Lot dwelt.

19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his
two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt
in a cave, he and his two daughters.

19:31 And the @Oborn said unto the younger, Our @ is old, and
@ is not a man in the @ to come in unto us @ the manner of
all the @: 19:32 Come, let us make our @ @b wine, and we
will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our @.

19:33 And they made @ @ @b wine that night: and the
@Oborn went in, and lay with her @; and he perceived not when
she lay down, nor when she arose.

19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the @Oborn said unto
the younger, @., I lay yesternight with my @: let us make him
@b wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we
may preserve seed of our @.

19:35 And they made @ @ @b wine that night also: and the
younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose.

19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by @ @.

19:37 And the @O born bare a son, and @, his name Moab: the
same is the @ of the Moabites unto this day.

19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and @, his name
Benammi: the same is the @ of the @ of Ammon unto this
day.

20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
@., thou art but a dead man, for the woman @ thou hast taken;
for she is a man's wife.

20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou
slay also a @ceous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my
sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my @X: in the
integrity of my @ and innocency of my @D have I done this.

20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy @; for I also withheld thee from
sinning @
 me: @fore suffered I thee not to touch her.

20:7 Now @fore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and
he @ pray for thee, and thou @ live: and if thou restore her
not, know thou that thou @ surely die, thou, and all that are
@.

20:8 @N Abimelech rose early in the morning, and @, all his
@<s, and told all @ @ in @ ears: and the men were
sore afraid.

20:9 Then Abimelech @, Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast @ on
me and on my kingdom a @ sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that
ought not to be done.

20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
hast done this @7?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,
Surely the fear of God is not in this @'; and they will slay me for
my wife's sake.

20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
@, but not the daughter of my m@C; and she became my wife.

20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
@'s @, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness @ thou
@ shew unto me; at @ @' whither we @ come, say of me,
He is my @X.

20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men@<s, and
women@<s, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
wife.

20:15 And Abimelech said, @., my land is @	 thee: dwell where
it pleaseth thee.

20:16 And unto Sarah he said, @., I have @= thy @X a
@: pieces of silver: @%, he is to thee a covering of the
eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all @C: thus she was
reproved.

20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
wife, and his maid@<s; and they bare @.

20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the @ of
Abimelech, @ of Sarah Abraham's wife.

21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto
Sarah as he had spoken.

21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
the set time of @ God had spoken to him.

21:3 And Abraham @, the name of his son that was born unto him,
whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
God had @M him.

21:5 And Abraham was an @/ @8 old, when his son Isaac was born
unto him.

21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear
will laugh with me.

21:7 And she said, Who @L have said unto Abraham, that Sarah @#
have @= @ suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a @
feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the @-ian, @ she had born
unto Abraham, mocking.

21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
son: for the son of this bondwoman @ not be heir with my son, even
with Isaac.

21:11 And the @7 was very grievous in Abraham's sight @ of
his son.

21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
@ of the lad, and @ of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
hath said unto thee, hearken unto her @;; for in Isaac @ thy
seed be @,.

21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
@ he is thy seed.

21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took @d, and a
bottle of @Z, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her @#er,
and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in
the wilderness of Beersheba.

21:15 And the @Z was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
@[ one of the shrubs.

21:16 And she went, and sat her down over @
 him a good way off,
as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the @^ of the
child. And she sat over @
 him, and lift up her @;, and wept.

21:17 And God @) the @; of the lad; and the angel of God @,
to Hagar out of @1, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?
fear not; for God hath @) the @; of the lad where he is.

21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in @ hand; for I will
make him a @ nation.

21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of @Z; and she
went, and filled the bottle with @Z, and gave the lad @b.

21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
wilderness, and became an archer.

21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his m@C took him

21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
chief captain of his host @0 unto Abraham, @, God is with thee
in all that thou doest: 21:23 Now @fore swear unto me here by God
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my
son's son: but @$ to the kindness that I have done unto thee,
thou @ do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.

21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech @ of a well of @Z, @
Abimelech's @<s had violently taken away.

21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this @7; @"
didst thou tell me, @" yet @) I of it, but to day.

21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
and both of them made a covenant.

21:28 And Abraham set @H ewe lambs of the flock by @T.

21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean @ @H ewe lambs
@ thou hast set by @T?  21:30 And he said, For @ @H
ewe lambs @ thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto
me, that I have digged this well.

21:31 Wherefore he @, that @' Beersheba; @ @ they
sware both of them.

21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,
and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the
land of the Philistines.

21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and @, @ on
the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

22:1 And it came to pass @ @ @, that God did tempt
Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, @., here I am.

22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, @ only son Isaac, whom thou
lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him @ for
a @_ @& upon one of the mountains @ I will tell thee of.

22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave
the wood for the @_ @&, and rose up, and went unto the @'
of @ God had told him.

22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
@' afar off.

22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come @* to you.

22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the @_ @&, and laid it upon
Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they
went both of them @?.

22:7 And Isaac @0 unto Abraham his @, and said, My @: and
he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, @. the fire and the wood:
but where is the lamb for a @_ @&?  22:8 And Abraham said, My
son, God will provide @9 a lamb for a @_ @&: so they
went both of them @?.

22:9 And they came to the @' @ God had told him of; and Abraham
built an @\ @, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
son, and laid him on the @\ upon the wood.

22:10 And Abraham stretched @ his hand, and took the knife to slay
his son.

22:11 And the angel of the LORD @, unto him out of @1, and
said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

22:12 And he said, Lay not @ hand upon the lad, @" do thou
any @7 unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou
hast not withheld thy son, @ only son from me.

22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and @% behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took
the ram, and offered him up for a @_ @& in the stead of his
son.

22:14 And Abraham @, the name of that @' Jehovahjireh: as it is
said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it @ be seen.

22:15 And the angel of the LORD @, unto Abraham out of @1 the
second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, @
 the LORD,
for @ thou hast done this @7, and hast not withheld thy son,
@ only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in

22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
went @? to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

22:20 And it came to pass @ @ @, that it was told
Abraham, @, @., Milcah, she hath also born @ unto thy

Kemuel the @ of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,
and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: @ eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
Abraham's @X.

22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

23:1 And Sarah was an @/ and @H and twenty @8 old: @
were the @8 of the life of Sarah.

23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

23:3 And Abraham stood up from @	 his dead, and @0 unto the
sons of Heth, @, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:
give me a possession of a burying@' with you, that I may bury my
dead out of my sight.

23:5 And the @ of Heth @> Abraham, @ unto him, 23:6
Hear us, my lord: thou art a @By prince @ us: in the choice of

23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed @9 to the @ of the
land, even to the @ of Heth.

23:8 And he communed with them, @, If it be your mind that I
@# bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to
Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of
Machpelah, @ he hath, @ is in the end of his field; for as

23:10 And Ephron dwelt @ the @ of Heth: and Ephron the
Hittite @> Abraham in the audience of the @ of Heth, even
of all that went in at the gate of his city, @, 23:11 Nay, my
lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is @in, I
give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my @ give I it thee:

23:12 And Abraham bowed down @9 @	 the @ of the land.

23:13 And he @0 unto Ephron in the audience of the @ of the
land, @, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will
give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead
@.

23:14 And Ephron @> Abraham, @ unto him, 23:15 My lord,
hearken unto me: the land is worth four @/ shekels of silver;
what is that betwixt me and thee? bury @fore thy dead.

23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron
the silver, @ he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,
four @/ shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

23:17 And the field of Ephron @ was in Machpelah, @ was @	
Mamre, the field, and the cave @ was @in, and all the trees
that were in the field, that were in all the borders round @+, were
made sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the
@ of Heth, @	 all that went in at the gate of his city.

23:19 And @ this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
field of Machpelah @	 Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan.

23:20 And the field, and the cave that is @in, were made sure unto
Abraham for a possession of a burying@' by the sons of Heth.

24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had
blessed Abraham in all @.

24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest @< of his @, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand @[ my thigh: 24:3
And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of @1, and the God

go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son
Isaac.

24:5 And the @< said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs @( thy son @*
unto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto
him, Beware thou that thou @( not my son thither @*.

24:7 The LORD God of @1, @ took me from my @'s @, and

24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
@ be clear from this my oath: only @( not my son thither @*.

24:9 And the @< put his hand @[ the thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

24:10 And the @< took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down @S the city by a well
of @Z at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out
to draw @Z.

24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

24:13 @., I stand here by the well of @Z; and the daughters of
the men of the city come out to draw @Z: 24:14 And let it come to
pass, that the damsel to whom I @ say, Let down thy pitcher, I

24:15 And it came to pass, @	 he had done @King, that, @%,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
Nahor, Abraham's @X, with her pitcher upon her @#er.

24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, @" had
any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up.

24:17 And the @< ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,

24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave him @b.

24:19 And when she had done giving him @b, she said, I will draw
@Z for thy camels also, until they have done @bing.

24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
@* unto the well to draw @Z, and drew for all his camels.

24:21 And the man wondering at her held his @U, to wit whether the
LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done @bing, that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets
for her @D of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose
daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is @ room in thy @'s
@ for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, @ she bare unto Nahor.

24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
enough, and room to lodge in.

24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being
in the way, the LORD led me to the @ of my master's @3.

24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her m@C's @ @
@.

24:29 And Rebekah had a @X, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran
out unto the man, unto the well.

24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
his sister's @D, and when he @) the @5 of Rebekah his sister,
@, Thus @0 the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
@%, he stood by the camels at the well.

24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
standest thou @S? for I have prepared the @, and room for the
camels.

24:32 And the man came into the @: and he ungirded his camels, and
gave straw and provender for the camels, and @Z to wash his feet,
and the men's feet that were with him.

24:33 And @ was set meat @	 him to eat: but he said, I will
not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's @<.

24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master @ly; and he is become
@: and he hath @= him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,
and men@<s, and maid@<s, and camels, and asses.

24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was
old: and unto him hath he @= all that he hath.

24:37 And my master made me swear, @, Thou @ not take a wife
to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
24:38 But thou @ go unto my @'s @, and to my kindred, and

24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not

24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, @	 whom I walk, will send his

they give not thee one, thou @ be clear from my oath.

24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my

@., I stand by the well of @Z; and it @ come to pass, that
when the virgin cometh @ to draw @Z, and I say to her, Give me,

24:45 And @	 I had done @King in mine @, @%, Rebekah

24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her @#er,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels @b also: so I drank,
and she made the camels @b also.

24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:
and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her @D.

24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
the LORD God of my master Abraham, @ had led me in the @c way
to take my master's @X's daughter unto his son.

24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell

24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel @> and said, The @7 proceedeth
from the LORD: we cannot @K unto thee bad or good.

24:51 @., Rebekah is @	 thee, take her, and go, and let her be

24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's @< @) @

24:53 And the @< @ @ jewels of silver, and jewels of

24:54 And they did eat and @b, he and the men that were with him,
and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,
Send me away unto my master.

24:55 And her @X and her m@C said, Let the damsel abide with
us a few days, at the least ten; @ that she @ go.

24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath

24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
@P.

24:58 And they @, Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
this man? And she said, I will go.

24:59 And they sent away Rebekah @ sister, and her nurse, and
Abraham's @<, and his men.

24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
sister, be thou the m@C of @:s of millions, and let thy seed
possess the gate of @J @ hate them.

24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
camels, and followed the man: and the @< took Rebekah, and went
his way.

24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
in the south country.

24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and
he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, @%, the camels were coming.

24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
lighted off the camel.

24:65 For she had said unto the @<, What man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us? And the @< had said, It is my master:
@fore she took a vail, and covered herself.

24:66 And the @< told Isaac all @ that he had done.

24:67 And Isaac @ her into his m@C Sarah's tent, and took
Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was
comforted @ his m@C's @^.

25:1 Then @* Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
Ishbak, and Shuah.

25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,
and Eldaah. All @ were the @ of Keturah.

25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, @ Abraham had, Abraham
gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
eastward, unto the east country.

25:7 And @ are the days of the @8 of Abraham's life @ he
lived, an @/ @@score and fifteen @8.

25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
old man, and full of @8; and was ga@d to his @.

25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, @
is @	 Mamre; 25:10 The field @ Abraham purchased of the sons

25:11 And it came to pass @ the @^ of Abraham, that God blessed
his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

25:12 Now @ are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
Hagar the @-ian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And
@ are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by @ names, @$

and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons

25:17 And @ are the @8 of the life of Ishmael, an @/ and

ga@d unto his @.

25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is @	 @-, as
thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his
@3.

25:19 And @ are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
begat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty @8 old when he took Rebekah
to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister
to Laban the Syrian.

25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, @ she was
barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife
conceived.

25:22 And the @ struggled @? within her; and she said, If
it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.

25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
manner of @ @ be separated from thy bowels; and the one
@ @ be stronger than the @C @; and the elder @
serve the younger.

25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, @%, @
were twins in her womb.

25:25 And the @O came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and
they @, his name Esau.

25:26 And @ that came his @X out, and his hand took hold on
Esau's heel; and his name was @, @]: and Isaac was @@score
@8 old when she bare them.

25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
field; and @] was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, @ he did eat of his venison: but
Rebekah loved @].

25:29 And @] sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
faint: 25:30 And Esau said to @], Feed me, I pray thee, with that
same red pottage; for I am faint: @fore was his name @, Edom.

25:31 And @] said, Sell me this day thy birth@c.

25:32 And Esau said, @., I am at the point to die: and what profit
@ this birth@c do to me?  25:33 And @] said, Swear to me

25:34 Then @] gave Esau @d and pottage of lentiles; and he did
eat and @b, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his
birth@c.

26:1 And @ was a famine in the land, beside the @O famine that
was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.

26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into @-;
dwell in the land @ I @ tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this
land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and

all @ countries; and in thy seed @ all the nations of the

my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the @' asked him
of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She
is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the @' @# kill me for
Rebekah; @ she was fair to look upon.

26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been @ a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,
and, @%, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

26:9 And Abimelech @, Isaac, and said, @., of a surety she is
thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto
him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of
the @ @B lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou @#est
have @ guiltiness upon us.

26:11 And Abimelech charged all his @, @, He that toucheth
this man or his wife @ surely be put to @^.

26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
@/fold: and the LORD blessed him.

26:13 And the man waxed @, and went forward, and grew until he
became very @: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and
possession of herds, and @ store of @<s: and the Philistines
envied him.

26:15 For all the wells @ his @'s @<s had digged in the

filled them with @.

26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
@Bier than we.

26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
Gerar, and dwelt @.

26:18 And Isaac digged @* the wells of @Z, @ they had digged
in the days of Abraham his @; for the Philistines had stopped

26:19 And Isaac's @<s digged in the valley, and @V @ a

26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
@, The @Z is ours: and he @, the name of the well Esek;
@ they strove with him.

26:21 And they digged @F well, and strove for that also: and he
@, the name of it Sitnah.

26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged @F well; and for
that they strove not: and he @, the name of it Rehoboth; and he
said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we @ be fruitful
in the land.

26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
the God of Abraham thy @: fear not, for I am with thee, and will
bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my @< Abraham's sake.

26:25 And he builded an @\ @, and @, upon the name of the

well.

26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
hate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw
certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let @ be now
an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a
covenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not
touched thee, and as we have done unto thee no@7 but good, and have
sent thee away in @U: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and @b.

26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
@F: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in
@U.

26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's @<s came,
and told him concerning the well @ they had digged, and said unto
him, We have @V @Z.

26:33 And he @, it Shebah: @fore the name of the city is
Beersheba unto this day.

26:34 And Esau was forty @8 old when he took to wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
Hittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were
dim, so that he could not see, he @, Esau his eldest son, and said
unto him, My son: and he said unto him, @., here am I.

27:2 And he said, @. now, I am old, I know not the day of my

and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4
And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and @( it to me, that I

27:5 And Rebekah @) when Isaac @0 to Esau his son. And Esau went
to the field to hunt for venison, and to @( it.

27:6 And Rebekah @0 unto @] her son, @, @., I @) thy

27:8 Now @fore, my son, obey my @; @$ to that @ I

27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of

27:11 And @] said to Rebekah his m@C, @., Esau my @X is
a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My @ peradventure will
feel me, and I @ seem to him as a deceiver; and I @ @( a

27:13 And his m@C said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
obey my @;, and go fetch me them.

27:14 And he went, and fetched, and @ them to his m@C: and
his m@C made savoury meat, such as his @ loved.

27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, @
were with her in the @, and put them upon @] her younger son:
27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his @D,
and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat
and the @d, @ she had prepared, into the hand of her son @].

27:18 And he came unto his @, and said, My @: and he said,
Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And @] said unto his
@, I am Esau thy @O born; I have done @$ as thou badest
me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may

27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast @V it
so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God @ it
to me.

27:21 And Isaac said unto @], Come near, I pray thee, that I may
feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

27:22 And @] went near unto Isaac his @; and he felt him, and
said, The @; is @]'s @;, but the @D are the @D of Esau.

27:23 And he discerned him not, @ his @D were hairy, as his
@X Esau's @D: so he blessed him.

27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he @ it near to him,
and he did eat: and he @ him wine and he drank.

27:26 And his @ Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,
my son.

27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field @ the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 @N God
give thee of the dew of @1, and the fatness of the @, and
plenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let @ serve thee, and nations bow
down to thee: be lord over thy @3, and let thy m@C's sons bow
down to thee: cursed be @ one that curseth thee, and blessed be he
that blesseth thee.

27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
blessing @], and @] was yet scarce gone out from the presence of
Isaac his @, that Esau his @X came in from his hunting.

27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and @ it unto his
@, and said unto his @, Let my @ arise, and eat of his
son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

27:32 And Isaac his @ said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I
am thy son, thy @Oborn Esau.

27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he
that hath taken venison, and @ it me, and I have eaten of all
@	 thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he @ be
blessed.

27:34 And when Esau @) the @5 of his @, he cried with a
@ and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his @, Bless me,
even me also, O my @.

27:35 And he said, Thy @X came with subtilty, and hath taken away
thy blessing.

27:36 And he said, Is not he @cly named @]? for he hath
supplanted me @ two times: he took away my birth@c; and,
@%, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac @> and said unto
Esau, @., I have made him thy lord, and all his @3 have I

him: and what @ I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said
unto his @, Hast thou but one blessing, my @? bless me, even
me also, O my @. And Esau lifted up his @;, and wept.

27:39 And Isaac his @ @> and said unto him, @., thy

27:41 And Esau hated @] @ of the blessing wherewith his
@ blessed him: and Esau said in his @, The days of mourning
for my @ are at hand; then will I slay my @X @].

27:42 And @ @5 of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and
she sent and @, @] her younger son, and said unto him, @.,
thy @X Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort @9, purposing to
kill thee.

27:43 Now @fore, my son, obey my @;; arise, flee thou to Laban
my @X to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy
@X's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy @X's anger turn away
from thee, and he forget that @ thou hast done to him: then I will
send, and fetch thee from thence: why @# I be deprived also of you
both in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my
life @ of the daughters of Heth: if @] take a wife of the
daughters of Heth, such as @ @ are of the daughters of the
land, what good @ my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac @, @], and
blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou @ not take a

28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the @ of Bethuel thy m@C's

28:3 And God Al@By bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of @; 28:4 And give thee
the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, @ God gave
unto Abraham.

28:5 And Isaac sent away @]: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,
son of Bethuel the Syrian, the @X of Rebekah, @]'s and Esau's
m@C.

28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed @], and sent him away to
Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him
he gave him a charge, @, Thou @ not take a wife of the
daughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that @] obeyed his @ and his
m@C, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the
daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his @; 28:9 Then went Esau
unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives @ he had Mahalath the
daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his
wife.

28:10 And @] went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

28:11 And he lighted upon a certain @', and tarried @ all
night, @ the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that
@', and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that @' to
sleep.

28:12 And he dreamed, and @% a ladder set up on the @, and the
top of it reached to @1: and @% the angels of God ascending
and descending on it.

28:13 And, @%, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
God of Abraham thy @, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou

28:15 And, @%, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all @'s

28:16 And @] awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD
is in this @'; and I knew it not.

28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this @'! this is
none @C but the @ of God, and this is the gate of @1.

28:18 And @] rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
upon the top of it.

28:19 And he @, the name of that @' Bethel: but the name of

28:20 And @] vowed a vow, @, If God will be with me, and will

29:1 Then @] went on his journey, and came into the land of the

29:2 And he looked, and @% a well in the field, and, lo, @
were @@ flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they

29:3 And thither were all the flocks ga@d: and they rolled the

@* upon the well's @P in his @'.

29:4 And @] said unto them, My @3, whence be ye? And they
said, Of Haran are we.

29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
said, We know him.

29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
and, @%, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, @" is it time that the

29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be ga@d

@Z the sheep.

29:9 And while he yet @0 with them, Rachel came with her @'s
sheep; for she kept them.

29:10 And it came to pass, when @] saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
his m@C's @X, and the sheep of Laban his m@C's @X,
that @] went near, and rolled the stone from the well's @P, and

29:11 And @] kissed Rachel, and lifted up his @;, and wept.

29:12 And @] told Rachel that he was her @'s @X, and that

29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban @) the tidings of @] his

him, and @ him to his @. And he told Laban all @ @.

29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my @R. And
he abode with him the space of a month.

29:15 And Laban said unto @], Because thou art my @X,
@#est thou @fore serve me for nought? tell me, what @ thy
wages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder
was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
favoured.

29:18 And @] loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee @H @8
for Rachel thy younger daughter.

29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
I @# give her to @F man: abide with me.

29:20 And @] served @H @8 for Rachel; and they seemed unto
him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

29:21 And @] said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

29:22 And Laban ga@d @? all the men of the @', and made a
feast.

29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and @ her to him; and he went in unto her.

29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.

29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, @%, it was Leah:
and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
the younger @	 the @Oborn.

29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
@ thou @ serve with me yet @H @C @8.

29:28 And @] did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel

29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid.

29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
than Leah, and served with him yet @H @C @8.

29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
but Rachel was barren.

29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she @, his name
Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;
now @fore my husband will love me.

29:33 And she conceived @*, and bare a son; and said, Because the

29:34 And she conceived @*, and bare a son; and said, Now this time

29:35 And she conceived @*, and bare a son: and she said, Now will

30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare @] no @, Rachel

30:2 And @]'s anger was kindled @

30:3 And she said, @. my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she

30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and @] went in

30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare @] a son.

30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also @) my

30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived @*, and bare @] a second

30:8 And Rachel said, With @ wrestlings have I wrestled with my

30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her

30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare @] a son.

30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she @, his name Gad.

30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare @] a second son.

30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me

30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and @V

Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken

Rachel said, @N he @ lie with thee to night for thy son's

30:16 And @] came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I
have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that
night.

30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare @]
the fifth son.

30:18 And Leah said, God hath @= me my hire, @ I have @=

30:19 And Leah conceived @*, and bare @] the sixth son.

30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my

30:21 And @wards she bare a daughter, and @, her name Dinah.

30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened

30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away

30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that @]
said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own @', and

30:26 Give me my wives and my @, for whom I have served thee,

30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have @V favour in

30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and

30:30 For it was little @ thou hadst @	 I came, and it is now

30:32 I will pass @E all thy flock to day, removing from thence

30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and

30:39 And the flocks conceived @	 the rods, and @ @

30:40 And @] did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the

31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your @.

31:7 And your @ hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
but God suffered him not to hurt me.

31:8 If he said thus, The speckled @ be thy wages; then all the
cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked @ be
thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your @, and @=
them to me.

31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that
I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, @%, the rams @
leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

31:11 And the angel of God @0 unto me in a dream, @, @]:
And I said, Here am I.

31:12 And he said, Lift up now @ eyes, and see, all the rams @
leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I
have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this
land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

31:14 And Rachel and Leah @> and said unto him, Is @ yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our @'s @?  31:15 Are we not
counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured
also our money.

31:16 For all the riches @ God hath taken from our @, that is
ours, and our @'s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto
thee, do.

31:17 Then @] rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods @ he
had gotten, the cattle of his getting, @ he had gotten in
Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his @ in the land of Canaan.

31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
images that were her @'s.

31:20 And @] stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
told him not that he fled.

31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that @] was fled.

31:23 And he took his @3 with him, and pursued @ him @H
days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
unto him, Take heed that thou @K not to @] either good or bad.

31:25 Then Laban overtook @]. Now @] had pitched his tent in the
mount: and Laban with his @3 pitched in the mount of Gilead.

31:26 And Laban said to @], What hast thou done, that thou hast
stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives
taken with the @Q?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,
and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I @B have sent
thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou
hast now done foolishly in so doing.

31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
your @ @0 unto me yesternight, @, Take thou heed that
thou @K not to @] either good or bad.

31:30 And now, though thou @Lest needs be gone, @ thou sore
longedst @ thy @'s @, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods?  31:31 And @] @> and said to Laban, Because I was
afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou @Lest take by force thy
daughters from me.

31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: @	
our @3 discern thou what is @ with me, and take it to thee.
For @] knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

31:33 And Laban went into @]'s tent, and into Leah's tent, and into
the two maid@<s' tents; but he @V them not. Then went he out
of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
@V them not.

31:35 And she said to her @, Let it not displease my lord that I
cannot rise up @	 thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
searched but @V not the images.

31:36 And @] was wroth, and chode with Laban: and @] @>
and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast
so hotly pursued @ me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my
stuff, what hast thou @V of all thy @hold stuff? set it here
@	 my @3 and thy @3, that they may judge betwixt us
both.

31:38 This twenty @8 have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
goats have not cast @ young, and the rams of thy flock have I not
eaten.

31:39 That @ was torn of beasts I @ not unto thee; I bare
the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by
day, or stolen by night.

31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

31:41 Thus have I been twenty @8 in thy @; I served thee
fourteen @8 for thy two daughters, and six @8 for thy cattle:
and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

31:42 Except the God of my @, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my @D, and rebuked thee
yesternight.

31:43 And Laban @> and said unto @], These daughters are my
daughters, and @ @ are my @, and @ cattle are my
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day
unto @ my daughters, or unto @ @ @ they have born?
31:44 Now @fore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and
let it be for a witness between me and thee.

31:45 And @] took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

31:46 And @] said unto his @3, Gather stones; and they took
stones, and made an heap: and they did eat @ upon the heap.

31:47 And Laban @, it Jegarsahadutha: but @] @, it Galeed.

31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this
day.

@N was the name of it @, Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he
said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from
@F.

31:50 If thou @ afflict my daughters, or if thou @ take @C
wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness
betwixt me and thee.

31:51 And Laban said to @], @. this heap, and @% this
pillar, @ I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be
witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this
heap to thee, and that thou @ not pass over this heap and this
pillar unto me, for harm.

31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of @
@, judge betwixt us. And @] sware by the fear of his @
Isaac.

31:54 Then @] offered sacrifice upon the mount, and @, his
@3 to eat @d: and they did eat @d, and tarried all night
in the mount.

31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and
his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto
his @'.

32:1 And @] went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

32:2 And when @] saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
@, the name of that @' Mahanaim.

32:3 And @] sent messengers @	 him to Esau his @X unto the
land of Seir, the country of Edom.

32:4 And he @M them, @, Thus @ ye @K unto my lord
Esau; Thy @< @] @
 thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and
stayed @ until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and
men@<s, and women@<s: and I have sent to tell my lord, that
I may find grace in thy sight.

32:6 And the messengers returned to @], @, We came to thy
@X Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four @/ men
with him.

32:7 Then @] was @ly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
@ that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and
smite it, then the @C company @ is left @ escape.

32:9 And @] said, O God of my @ Abraham, and God of my @
Isaac, the LORD @ saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to
thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of
the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, @ thou hast
shewed unto thy @<; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;
and now I am become two bands.

32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my @X, from the
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the
m@C with the @.

32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
as the sand of the sea, @ cannot be numbered for multitude.

32:13 And he lodged @ that same night; and took of that @ came
to his hand a present for Esau his @X; 32:14 Two @/ she
goats, and twenty he goats, two @/ ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15
Thirty milch camels with @ colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
twenty she asses, and ten foals.

32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his @<s, @ drove
by @T; and said unto his @<s, Pass over @	 me, and
put a space betwixt drove and drove.

32:17 And he @M the foremost, @, When Esau my @X
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, @, Whose art thou? and whither
goest thou? and whose are @ @	 thee?  32:18 Then thou @
say, They be thy @< @]'s; it is a present sent unto my lord
Esau: and, @%, also he is behind us.

32:19 And so @M he the second, and the third, and all that
followed the droves, @, On this manner @ ye @K unto Esau,
when ye find him.

32:20 And say ye moreover, @., thy @< @] is behind us. For
he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth @	 me, and
@ward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

32:21 So went the present over @	 him: and @9 lodged that
night in the company.

32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
women@<s, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.

32:24 And @] was left alone; and @ wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day.

32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not @
 him, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of @]'s thigh was out of
joint, as he wrestled with him.

32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, @].

32:28 And he said, Thy name @ be @, no more @], but @:
for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast
prevailed.

32:29 And @] asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask @ my name? And he
blessed him @.

32:30 And @] @, the name of the @' Peniel: for I have seen
God face to face, and my life is preserved.

32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
halted upon his thigh.

32:32 @N the @ of @ eat not of the sinew @
shrank, @ is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: @
he touched the hollow of @]'s thigh in the sinew that shrank.

33:1 And @] lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, @%, Esau came,
and with him four @/ men. And he divided the @ unto Leah,
and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

33:2 And he put the handmaids and @ @ foremost, and Leah
and her @ @, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

33:3 And he passed over @	 them, and bowed @9 to the ground
@H times, until he came near to his @X.

33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,
and kissed him: and they wept.

33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the @;
and said, Who are @J with thee? And he said, The @ @ God
hath graciously @= thy @<.

33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and @ @, and they
bowed @T.

33:7 And Leah also with her @ came near, and bowed @T:
and @ came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed @T.

33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove @ I met? And
he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my @X; keep that thou hast
unto thyself.

33:10 And @] said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have @V grace in
thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for @fore I have
seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast
pleased with me.

33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is @ to thee; @
God hath dealt graciously with me, and @ I have enough. And he
urged him, and he took it.

33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
go @	 thee.

33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the @ are
tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men
@# overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over @	 his @<: and I
will lead on softly, @$ as the cattle that goeth @	 me and
the @ be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the
sight of my lord.

33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

33:17 And @] journeyed to Succoth, and built him an @, and made
booths for his cattle: @fore the name of the @' is @,
Succoth.

33:18 And @] came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, @ is in the
land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent
@	 the city.

33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,
at the hand of the @ of Hamor, Shechem's @, for an @/
pieces of money.

33:20 And he erected @ an @\, and @, it Elelohe@.

34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, @ she bare unto @], went
out to see the daughters of the land.

34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of @], and he loved
the damsel, and @0 kindly unto the damsel.

34:4 And Shechem @0 unto his @ Hamor, @, Get me this
damsel to wife.

34:5 And @] @) that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his
sons were with his cattle in the field: and @] held his @U until
they were come.

34:6 And Hamor the @ of Shechem went out unto @] to commune
with him.

34:7 And the sons of @] came out of the field when they @) it:
and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, @ he had
wrought folly in @ in lying with @]'s daughter: @ @7
ought not to be done.

34:8 And Hamor communed with them, @, The soul of my son Shechem
longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,
and take our daughters unto you.

34:10 And ye @ dwell with us: and the land @ be @	 you;
dwell and trade ye @in, and get you possessions @in.

34:11 And Shechem said unto her @ and unto her @3, Let me
find grace in your eyes, and what ye @ say unto me I will give.

34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give @$
as ye @ say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

34:13 And the sons of @] @> Shechem and Hamor his @
deceitfully, and said, @ he had defiled Dinah @ sister:
34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this @7, to give our
sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
that @ male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our
daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will
dwell with you, and we will become one @.

34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will
we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

34:18 And @ @5 pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the @7, @ he had
delight in @]'s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the
@ of his @.

34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of @ city,
and communed with the men of @ city, @, 34:21 These men are
@Uable with us; @fore let them dwell in the land, and trade
@in; for the land, @%, it is large enough for them; let us
take @ daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our
daughters.

34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
to be one @, if @ male @ us be circumcised, as they are
circumcised.

34:23 Shall not @ cattle and @ substance and @ beast of
@'s be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell
with us.

34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went
out of the gate of his city; and @ male was circumcised, all that
went out of the gate of his city.

34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that
two of the sons of @], Simeon and Levi, Dinah's @3, took each
man his @Q, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
@Q, and took Dinah out of Shechem's @, and went out.

34:27 The sons of @] came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
@ they had defiled @ sister.

34:28 They took @ sheep, and @ oxen, and @ asses, and that
@ was in the city, and that @ was in the field, 34:29 And all
@ wealth, and all @ little ones, and @ wives took they
captive, and spoiled even all that was in the @.

34:30 And @] said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
me to stink @ the inhabitants of the land, @ the Canaanites
and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they @ gather
@T @? @
 me, and slay me; and I @ be destroyed,
I and my @.

34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
35:1 And God said unto @], Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell @:
and make @ an @\ unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy @X.

35:2 Then @] said unto his @hold, and to all that were with
him, Put away the strange gods that are @ you, and be clean, and
change your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and
I will make @ an @\ unto God, who @> me in the day of my
distress, and was with me in the way @ I went.

35:4 And they gave unto @] all the strange gods @ were in @
hand, and all @ earrings @ were in @ ears; and @] hid
them @[ the oak @ was by Shechem.

35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the @G
that were round @+ them, and they did not pursue @ the sons of
@].

35:6 So @] came to Luz, @ is in the land of Canaan, that is,
Bethel, he and all the @ that were with him.

35:7 And he built @ an @\, and @, the @' Elbethel:
@ @ God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his
@X.

35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
Bethel @[ an oak: and the name of it was @, Allonbachuth.

35:9 And God appeared unto @] @*, when he came out of Padanaram,
and blessed him.

35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is @]: thy name @ not be
@, any more @], but @ @ be thy name: and he @, his
name @.

35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Al@By: be fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company of nations @ be of thee, and
kings @ come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land @ I gave
Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed @ thee
will I give the land.

35:13 And God went up from him in the @' where he talked with him.

35:14 And @] set up a pillar in the @' where he talked with him,
even a pillar of stone: and he poured a @b @& @on, and he
poured oil @on.

35:15 And @] @, the name of the @' where God @0 with him,
Bethel.

35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and @ was but a little way
to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou @ have this son also.

35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
died) that she @, his name Benoni: but his @ @, him
Benjamin.

35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, @ is
Bethlehem.

35:20 And @] set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
Rachel's grave unto this day.

35:21 And @ journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
Edar.

35:22 And it came to pass, when @ dwelt in that land, that Reuben
went and lay with Bilhah his @'s concubine: and @ @) it.
Now the sons of @] were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,
@]'s @Oborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and @, and Issachar, and
Zebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the
sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the
sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: @ are the sons of
@], @ were born to him in Padanaram.

35:27 And @] came unto Isaac his @ unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, @ is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

35:28 And the days of Isaac were an @/ and fourscore @8.

35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was ga@d unto his
@, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and @] buried
him.

36:1 Now @ are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter
of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter
of Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of
Nebajoth.

36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And
Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: @ are the sons of
Esau, @ were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all
the persons of his @, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all
his substance, @ he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into
the country from the face of his @X @].

36:7 For @ riches were more than that they @B dwell @?;
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them @
of @ cattle.

36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

36:9 And @ are the generations of Esau the @ of the Edomites
in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the
son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of
Esau.

36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
Kenaz.

37:2 These are the generations of @]. Joseph, being @Hteen @8
old, was feeding the flock with his @3; and the lad was with the

Joseph @ unto his @ @ evil report.

37:3 Now @ loved Joseph more than all his @, @ he

37:4 And when his @3 saw that @ @ loved him more than

37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his @3: and they
hated him yet the more.

37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream @ I have
dreamed: 37:7 For, @%, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,
lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood up@c; and, @%, your sheaves
stood round @+, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

37:8 And his @3 said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
@ thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the
more for his dreams, and for his @5.

37:9 And he dreamed yet @F dream, and told it his @3, and
said, @., I have dreamed a dream more; and, @%, the sun and
the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

37:10 And he told it to his @, and to his @3: and his
@ rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou
hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy m@C and thy @3 indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the @?  37:11 And his @3
envied him; but his @ observed the @.

37:12 And his @3 went to feed @ @'s flock in Shechem.

37:13 And @ said unto Joseph, Do not thy @3 feed the flock
in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,
Here am I.

37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with
thy @3, and well with the flocks; and @( me word @*. So he
sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

37:15 And a certain man @V him, and, @%, he was wandering in
the field: and the man asked him, @, What seekest thou?  37:16
And he said, I seek my @3: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed
@ flocks.

37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I @) them say,
Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went @ his @3, and @V
them in Dothan.

37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even @	 he came near unto
them, they conspired @
 him to slay him.

37:19 And they said one to @F, @., this dreamer cometh.

37:20 Come now @fore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we @
see what will become of his dreams.

37:21 And Reuben @) it, and he delivered him out of @ @D;
and said, Let us not kill him.

37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no @I, but cast him into this
pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he @B
rid him out of @ @D, to deliver him to his @ @*.

37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his @3,
that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that
was on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the
pit was empty, @ was no @Z in it.

37:25 And they sat down to eat @d: and they lifted up @ eyes
and looked, and, @%, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
with @ camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry
it down to @-.

37:26 And @ said unto his @3, What profit is it if we slay
our @X, and conceal his @I?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him
to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our
@X and our @R. And his @3 were content.

37:28 Then @ passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver: and they @ Joseph into @-.

37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, @%, Joseph was not in
the pit; and he rent his clothes.

37:30 And he returned unto his @3, and said, The child is not;
and I, whither @ I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and
killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the @I; 37:32 And
they sent the coat of many colours, and they @ it to @
@; and said, This have we @V: know now whether it be thy son's
coat or no.

37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
hath devoured him; Joseph is @S doubt rent in pieces.

37:34 And @] rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
and mourned for his son many days.

37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into
the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his @ wept for him.

37:36 And the Midianites sold him into @- unto Potiphar, an officer
of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that @ went down from his
@3, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

38:2 And @ saw @ a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he @, his name Er.

38:4 And she conceived @*, and bare a son; and she @, his name
Onan.

38:5 And she yet @* conceived, and bare a son; and @, his name
Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

38:6 And @ took a wife for Er his @Oborn, whose name was Tamar.

38:7 And Er, @'s @Oborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
and the LORD slew him.

38:8 And @ said unto Onan, Go in unto thy @X's wife, and
marry her, and raise up seed to thy @X.

38:9 And Onan knew that the seed @# not be his; and it came to
pass, when he went in unto his @X's wife, that he spilled it on
the ground, lest that he @# give seed to his @X.

38:10 And the @7 @ he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
slew him also.

38:11 Then said @ to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
thy @'s @, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his @3 did. And Tamar went and
dwelt in her @'s @.

38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah @'s wife died;
and @ was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

38:13 And it was told Tamar, @, @. thy @ in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep.

38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open @', @ is
by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was
not @= unto him to wife.

38:15 When @ saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; @ she
had covered her face.

38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,
let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter
in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come
in unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.
And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18
And he said, What pledge @ I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,
and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in @ hand. And he gave it
her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and
put on the garments of her widowhood.

38:20 And @ sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he @V her not.

38:21 Then he asked the men of that @', @, Where is the
harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no
harlot in this @'.

38:22 And he returned to @, and said, I cannot find her; and also
the men of the @' said, that @ was no harlot in this @'.

38:23 And @ said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
@%, I sent this kid, and thou hast not @V her.

38:24 And it came to pass @+ @@ months @, that it was told
@, @, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and
also, @%, she is with child by whoredom. And @ said, Bring her
@, and let her be @_.

38:25 When she was @ @, she sent to her @ in law,
@, By the man, whose @ are, am I with child: and she said,
Discern, I pray thee, whose are @, the signet, and bracelets, and
staff.

38:26 And @ acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
@ceous than I; @ that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he
knew her @* no more.

38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, @%,
twins were in her womb.

38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread, @, This came out @O.

38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, @%, his
@X came out: and she said, How hast thou broken @? this
breach be upon thee: @fore his name was @, Pharez.

38:30 And @ward came out his @X, that had the scarlet thread

39:1 And Joseph was @ down to @-; and Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an @-ian, bought him of the @D of
the Ishmeelites, @ had @ him down thither.

39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he
was in the @ of his master the @-ian.

39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD
made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

39:4 And Joseph @V grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
made him overseer over his @, and all that he had he put into his
hand.

39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
in his @, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the
@-ian's @ for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the @, and in the field.

39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
ought he had, save the @d @ he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly
person, and well favoured.

39:7 And it came to pass @ @ @, that his master's wife
cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, @., my

39:11 And it came to pass @+ this time, that Joseph went into the

39:12 And she caught him by his garment, @, Lie with me: and he
left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment

39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

39:17 And she @0 unto him @$ to @ @5, @, The

39:19 And it came to pass, when his master @) the @5 of his

39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
@' where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was @ in the
prison.

39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did @, he
was the doer of it.

39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any @7 that was @[

40:1 And it came to pass @ @ @, that the butler of the

40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth @

 the

40:3 And he put them in ward in the @ of the captain of the guard,

40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
served them: and they continued a season in ward.

40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
night, each man @$ to the interpretation of his dream, the

40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon

40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of
his lord's @, @, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And
they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and @ is no
interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
In my dream, @%, a vine was @	 me; 40:10 And in the vine were
@@ branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot
@; and the clusters @of @ @ ripe grapes: 40:11 And
Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them
into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
@@ branches are @@ days: 40:13 Yet within @@ days @
Pharaoh lift up @ head, and restore thee unto thy @': and thou
@ deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, @ the former manner
when thou wast his butler.

40:14 But think on me when it @ be well with thee, and shew
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
and @( me out of this @: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out
of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done no@7 that
they @# put me into the dungeon.

40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, @%, I had @@
white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket @ was
of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out
of the basket upon my head.

40:18 And Joseph @> and said, This is the interpretation
@of: The @@ baskets are @@ days: 40:19 Yet within @@ days
@ Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and @ hang thee on a

40:20 And it came to pass the third day, @ was Pharaoh's birthday,
that he made a feast unto all his @<s: and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief baker @ his @<s.

40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership @*; and
he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief
baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full @8, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, @%, he stood by the river.

41:2 And, @%, @ came up out of the river @H well favoured
kine and fat@Red; and they fed in a meadow.

41:3 And, @%, @H @C kine came up @ them out of the
river, ill favoured and lean@Red; and stood by the @C kine upon
the brink of the river.

41:4 And the ill favoured and lean@Red kine did eat up the @H
well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, @%, @H ears
of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

41:6 And, @%, @H thin ears and blasted with the east wind
sprung up @ them.

41:7 And the @H thin ears devoured the @H rank and full ears.
And Pharaoh awoke, and, @%, it was a dream.

41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
and he sent and @, for all the magicians of @-, and all the
wise men @of: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but @ was none
that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

41:9 Then @0 the chief butler unto Pharaoh, @, I do remember
my faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his @<s, and put
me in ward in the captain of the guard's @, both me and the chief

41:12 And @ was @ with us a young man, an Hebrew, @< to

41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and @, Joseph, and they @ him
hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved @9, and changed his
raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and @

canst @[stand a dream to interpret it.

41:16 And Joseph @> Pharaoh, @, It is not in me: God @
give Pharaoh an answer of @U.

41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, @%, I stood upon
the bank of the river: 41:18 And, @%, @ came up out of the

kine did eat up the @O @H fat kine: 41:21 And when they had
eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but
they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, @%, @H ears came up in one

41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God

41:26 The @H good kine are @H @8; and the @H good ears are

of famine; and all the plenty @ be forgotten in the land of @-;
and the famine @ consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty @ not
be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it @
be very grievous.

41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
@ the @7 is established by God, and God will shortly @( it
to pass.

41:33 Now @fore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and
set him over the land of @-.

41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,
and take up the fifth part of the land of @- in the @H plenteous
@8.

41:35 And let them gather all the food of @J good @8 that come,
and lay up corn @[ the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in
the @G.

41:36 And that food @ be for store to the land @
 the @H
@8 of famine, @ @ be in the land of @-; that the land
perish not @E the famine.

41:37 And the @7 was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
of all his @<s.

41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his @<s, Can we find such a one as
this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said
unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, @ is none
so discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou @ be over my @,
and @$ unto thy word @ all my @ be ruled: only in the
throne will I be @er than thou.

41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
land of @-.

41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
gold chain @+ his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second
chariot @ he had; and they cried @	 him, Bow the knee: and he
made him ruler over all the land of @-.

41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and @S thee
@ no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of @-.

41:45 And Pharaoh @, Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah @6 of On. And
Joseph went out over all the land of @-.

41:46 And Joseph was thirty @8 old when he stood @	 Pharaoh
king of @-. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went @Eout all the land of @-.

41:47 And in the @H plenteous @8 the @ @ @ by
handfuls.

41:48 And he ga@d up all the food of the @H @8, @ were
in the land of @-, and laid up the food in the @G: the food of
the field, @ was round @+ @ city, laid he up in the same.

41:49 And Joseph ga@d corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for it was @S number.

41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons @	 the @8 of famine
came, @ Asenath the daughter of Potipherah @6 of On bare unto
him.

41:51 And Joseph @, the name of the @Oborn Manasseh: For God,
said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my @'s @.

41:52 And the name of the second @, he Ephraim: For God hath
caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

41:53 And the @H @8 of plenteousness, that was in the land of
@-, were ended.

41:54 And the @H @8 of d@ began to come, @$ as Joseph
had said: and the d@ was in all lands; but in all the land of
@- @ was @d.

41:55 And when all the land of @- was famished, the @ cried to
Pharaoh for @d: and Pharaoh said unto all the @-ians, Go unto
Joseph; what he @
 to you, do.

41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the @: and Joseph
opened all the store@s, and sold unto the @-ians; and the
famine waxed sore in the land of @-.

41:57 And all countries came into @- to Joseph for to buy corn;
@ that the famine was so sore in all lands.

42:1 Now when @] saw that @ was corn in @-, @] said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon @F?  42:2 And he said, @.,
I have @) that @ is corn in @-: get you down thither, and
buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

42:3 And Joseph's ten @3 went down to buy corn in @-.

42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's @X, @] sent not with his @3;
for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

42:5 And the sons of @ came to buy corn @ @J that came:
for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
sold to all the @ of the land: and Joseph's @3 came, and
bowed down @T @	 him with @ faces to the @.

42:7 And Joseph saw his @3, and he knew them, but made @9
strange unto them, and @0 roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

42:8 And Joseph knew his @3, but they knew not him.

42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams @ he dreamed of them, and
said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come.

42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
@<s come.

42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy @<s are no
spies.

42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.

42:13 And they said, Thy @<s are twelve @3, the sons of one
man in the land of Canaan; and, @%, the youngest is this day with
our @, and one is not.

42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I @0 unto you,
@, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye @ be proved: By the life of
Pharaoh ye @ not go @ hence, except your youngest @X come
hither.

42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your @X, and ye @ be
kept in prison, that your @5 may be proved, whether @ be any
truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

42:17 And he put them all @? into ward @@ days.

42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for
I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your @3 be bound
in the @ of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
@s: 42:20 But @( your youngest @X unto me; so @ your
@5 be verified, and ye @ not die. And they did so.

42:21 And they said one to @F, We are verily guilty concerning
our @X, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought
us, and we @L not hear; @fore is this distress come upon us.

42:22 And Reuben @> them, @, Spake I not unto you, @,
Do not sin @
 the child; and ye @L not hear? @fore,
@%, also his @I is required.

42:23 And they knew not that Joseph @[stood them; for he @0 unto
them by an interpreter.

42:24 And he turned @9 @+ from them, and wept; and returned to
them @*, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and
bound him @	 @ eyes.

42:25 Then Joseph @M to fill @ sacks with corn, and to
restore @ man's money into his sack, and to give them provision
for the way: and thus did he unto them.

42:26 And they laded @ asses with the corn, and departed thence.

42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
the inn, he espied his money; for, @%, it was in his sack's @P.

42:28 And he said unto his @3, My money is restored; and, lo, it
is even in my sack: and @ @ failed them, and they were afraid,
@ one to @F, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29
And they came unto @] @ @ unto the land of Canaan, and
told him all that befell unto them; @, 42:30 The man, who is the
lord of the land, @0 roughly to us, and took us for spies of the
country.

42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We
be twelve @3, sons of our @; one is not, and the youngest
is this day with our @ in the land of Canaan.

42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby @
I know that ye are true men; leave one of your @3 here with me,
and take food for the famine of your @holds, and be gone: 42:34
And @( your youngest @X unto me: then @ I know that ye are
no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your
@X, and ye @ traffick in the land.

42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied @ sacks, that, @%,
@ man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and
@ @ saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

42:36 And @] @ @ said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
@: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
away: all @ @ are @
 me.

42:37 And Reuben @0 unto his @, @, Slay my two sons, if I
@( him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will @( him
to thee @*.

42:38 And he said, My son @ not go down with you; for his @X
is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in
the @ ye go, then @ ye @( down my gray hairs with sorrow to
the grave.

43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.

43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn @ they
had @ out of @-, @ @ said unto them, Go @*, buy
us a little food.

43:3 And @ @0 unto him, @, The man did solemnly protest
unto us, @, Ye @ not see my face, except your @X be with
you.

43:4 If thou wilt send our @X with us, we will go down and buy
thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:
for the man said unto us, Ye @ not see my face, except your
@X be with you.

43:6 And @ said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
the man whether ye had yet a @X?  43:7 And they said, The man
asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, @, Is your
@ yet alive? have ye @F @X? and we told him @$
to the tenor of @ @5: could we certainly know that he @L
say, Bring your @X down?  43:8 And @ said unto @ his
@, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may
live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.

43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand @ thou require him: if I
@( him not unto thee, and set him @	 thee, then let me bear the
blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had
returned this second time.

43:11 And @ @ @ said unto them, If it must be so now, do
this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;
and the money that was @ @* in the @P of your sacks, carry
it @* in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take
also your @X, and arise, go @* unto the man: 43:14 And God
Al@By give you mercy @	 the man, that he may send away your
@C @X, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my @, I am
bereaved.

43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
@ hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to @-, and
stood @	 Joseph.

43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of
his @, Bring @ men home, and slay, and make ready; for @
men @ dine with me at noon.

43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man @ the men into
Joseph's @.

43:18 And the men were afraid, @ they were @ into Joseph's
@; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the @O time are we @ in; that he may seek occasion
@
 us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's @, and they
communed with him at the door of the @, 43:20 And said, O sir, we
came indeed down at the @O time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to
pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, @%,
@ man's money was in the @P of his sack, our money in full
weight: and we have @ it @* in our hand.

43:22 And @C money have we @ down in our @D to buy food:
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
your @, hath @= you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
And he @ Simeon out unto them.

43:24 And the man @ the men into Joseph's @, and gave them
@Z, and they washed @ feet; and he gave @ asses provender.

43:25 And they made ready the present @
 Joseph came at noon: for
they @) that they @# eat @d @.

43:26 And when Joseph came home, they @ him the present @
was in @ hand into the @, and bowed @T to him to the
@.

43:27 And he asked them of @ welfare, and said, Is your @
well, the old man of whom ye @0? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they
@>, Thy @< our @ is in good health, he is yet alive.
And they bowed down @ heads, and made obeisance.

43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his @X Benjamin, his
m@C's son, and said, Is this your younger @X, of whom ye @0
unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
@X: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,
and wept @.

43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained @9, and
said, Set on @d.

43:32 And they set on for him by @9, and for them by @T,
and for the @-ians, @ did eat with him, by @T: @
the @-ians @B not eat @d with the Hebrews; for that is an
abomination unto the @-ians.

43:33 And they sat @	 him, the @Oborn @$ to his
birth@c, and the youngest @$ to his youth: and the men
marvelled one at @F.

43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from @	 him: but
Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of @'s. And they
drank, and were merry with him.

44:1 And he @M the steward of his @, @, Fill the men's
sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put @ man's money
in his sack's @P.

44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's @P of the
youngest, and his corn money. And he did @$ to the word that
Joseph had spoken.

44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
and @ asses.

44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow @ the men; and when thou
dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for
good?  44:5 Is not this it in @ my lord @beth, and whereby
indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

44:6 And he overtook them, and he @0 unto them @ same @5.

44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore @
 my lord @ @5? God
forbid that thy @<s @# do @$ to this @7: 44:8
@., the money, @ we @V in our sacks' @Ps, we @

out of thy lord's @ silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy
@<s it be @V, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's
bondmen.

44:10 And he said, Now also let it be @$ unto your @5: he
with whom it is @V @ be my @<; and ye @ be blameless.

44:11 Then they speedily took down @ man his sack to the ground,
and opened @ man his sack.

44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
youngest: and the cup was @V in Benjamin's sack.

44:13 Then they rent @ clothes, and laded @ man his ass, and
returned to the city.

44:14 And @ and his @3 came to Joseph's @; for he was
yet @: and they fell @	 him on the ground.

44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And @
said, What @ we say unto my lord? what @ we @K?  or how
@ we clear ourselves? God hath @V out the iniquity of thy
@<s: @%, we are my lord's @<s, both we, and he also with
whom the cup is @V.

44:17 And he said, God forbid that I @# do so: but the man in
whose hand the cup is @V, he @ be my @<; and as for you,
get you up in @U unto your @.

44:18 Then @ came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
@<, I pray thee, @K a word in my lord's ears, and let not
@ anger burn @
 thy @<: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

44:19 My lord asked his @<s, @, Have ye a @, or a
@X?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a @, an old
man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his @X is
dead, and he alone is left of his m@C, and his @ loveth him.

44:21 And thou saidst unto thy @<s, Bring him down unto me, that
I may set mine eyes upon him.

44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his @: for
if he @# leave his @, his @ @L die.

44:23 And thou saidst unto thy @<s, Except your youngest @X
come down with you, ye @ see my face no more.

44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy @< my @,
we told him the @5 of my lord.

44:25 And our @ said, Go @*, and buy us a little food.

44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest @X be with
us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except
our youngest @X be with us.

44:27 And thy @< my @ said unto us, Ye know that my wife
bare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,
Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye
take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye @ @( down
my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

44:30 Now @fore when I come to thy @< my @, and the lad
be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
44:31 It @ come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
us, that he will die: and thy @<s @ @( down the gray hairs
of thy @< our @ with sorrow to the grave.

44:32 For thy @< became surety for the lad unto my @,
@, If I @( him not unto thee, then I @ bear the blame to
my @ for ever.

44:33 Now @fore, I pray thee, let thy @< abide instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his @3.

44:34 For how @ I go up to my @, and the lad be not with me?
lest peradventure I see the evil that @ come on my @.

45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain @9 @	 all them that stood
by him; and he cried, Cause @ man to go out from me. And @
stood no man with him, while Joseph made @9 known unto his
@3.

45:2 And he wept aloud: and the @-ians and the @ of Pharaoh
@).

45:3 And Joseph said unto his @3, I am Joseph; doth my @
yet live? And his @3 could not answer him; for they were
troubled at his presence.

45:4 And Joseph said unto his @3, Come near to me, I pray you.
And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your @X, whom ye
sold into @-.

45:5 Now @fore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither: for God did send me @	 you to preserve life.

45:6 For @ two @8 hath the famine been in the land: and yet
@ are five @8, in the @ @ @ @" be earing nor

45:7 And God sent me @	 you to preserve you a posterity in the

45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath
made me a @ to Pharaoh, and lord of all his @, and a ruler
@Eout all the land of @-.

45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my @, and say unto him, Thus @

thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all @-: come down unto me,
tarry not: 45:10 And thou @ dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou
@ be near unto me, thou, and thy @, and thy @'s
@, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11
And @ will I nourish thee; for yet @ are five @8 of famine;
lest thou, and thy @hold, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

45:12 And, @%, your eyes see, and the eyes of my @X Benjamin,
that it is my @P that @Keth unto you.

45:13 And ye @ tell my @ of all my @Y in @-, and of all
that ye have seen; and ye @ haste and @( down my @ hither.

45:14 And he fell upon his @X Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck.

45:15 Moreover he kissed all his @3, and wept upon them: and
@ that his @3 talked with him.

45:16 And the fame @of was @) in Pharaoh's @, @,
Joseph's @3 are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his
@<s.

45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy @3, This do ye;
lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And
take your @ and your @holds, and come unto me: and I will
give you the good of the land of @-, and ye @ eat the fat of
the land.

45:19 Now thou art @M, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
land of @- for your little ones, and for your wives, and @( your

45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
@- is your's.

45:21 And the @ of @ did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
@$ to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
the way.

45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
Benjamin he gave @@ @/ pieces of silver, and five changes of
raiment.

45:23 And to his @ he sent @ this manner; ten asses laden
with the good @ of @-, and ten she asses laden with corn and
@d and meat for his @ by the way.

45:24 So he sent his @3 away, and they departed: and he said
unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

45:25 And they went up out of @-, and came into the land of Canaan
unto @] @ @, 45:26 And told him, @, Joseph is yet
alive, and he is governor over all the land of @-. And @]'s
@ fainted, for he believed them not.

45:27 And they told him all the @5 of Joseph, @ he had said
unto them: and when he saw the wagons @ Joseph had sent to carry
him, the spirit of @] @ @ revived: 45:28 And @ said,
It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him @	
I die.

46:1 And @ took his journey with all that he had, and came to
Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his @ Isaac.

46:2 And God @0 unto @ in the visions of the night, and said,

46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy @: fear not to go down

46:5 And @] rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of @ carried
@] @ @, and @ little ones, and @ wives, in the

46:6 And they took @ cattle, and @ goods, @ they had

46:30 And @ said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen

46:31 And Joseph said unto his @3, and unto his @'s @,
I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My @3, and my
@'s @, @ were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
46:32 And the men are shepherds, for @ trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have @ @ flocks, and @ herds, and all

46:33 And it @ come to pass, when Pharaoh @ call you, and

both we, and also our @s: that ye may dwell in the land of

47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My @ and my
@3, and @ flocks, and @ herds, and all that they have,
are come out of the land of Canaan; and, @%, they are in the land
of Goshen.

47:2 And he took some of his @3, even five men, and presented
them unto Pharaoh.

47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his @3, What is your occupation? And
they said unto Pharaoh, Thy @<s are shepherds, both we, and also
our @s.

47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
come; for thy @<s have no pasture for @ flocks; for the
famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now @fore, we pray thee, let
thy @<s dwell in the land of Goshen.

47:5 And Pharaoh @0 unto Joseph, @, Thy @ and thy

47:7 And Joseph @ in @] his @, and set him @	
Pharaoh: and @] blessed Pharaoh.

47:8 And Pharaoh said unto @], How old art thou?  47:9 And @]
said unto Pharaoh, The days of the @8 of my pilgrimage are an

47:10 And @] blessed Pharaoh, and went out from @	 Pharaoh.

47:11 And Joseph @'d his @ and his @3, and gave them a

47:12 And Joseph nourished his @, and his @3, and all his

47:13 And @ was no @d in all the land; for the famine was very

47:14 And Joseph ga@d up all the money that was @V in the land
of @-, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn @ they bought:
and Joseph @ the money into Pharaoh's @.

47:15 And when money failed in the land of @-, and in the land of

for why @# we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
cattle, if money fail.

47:17 And they @ @ cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
@d in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle
of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with @d for all
@ cattle for that year.

47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our
money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; @ is not
ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
47:19 Wherefore @ we die @	 @ eyes, both we and our land?
buy us and our land for @d, and we and our land will be @<s

the land be not desolate.

47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of @- for Pharaoh; for the
@-ians sold @ man his field, @ the famine prevailed over
them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

47:21 And as for the @, he removed them to @G from one end of
the borders of @- even to the @C end @of.

47:22 Only the land of the @6s bought he not; for the @6s had
a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat @ portion @
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not @ lands.

47:23 Then Joseph said unto the @, @., I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye @
sow the land.

47:24 And it @ come to pass in the increase, that ye @ give
the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts @ be your own, for
seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your @holds,
and for food for your little ones.

47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's @<s.

47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of @- unto this day,
that Pharaoh @# have the fifth part, except the land of the

47:27 And @ dwelt in the land of @-, in the country of Goshen;

47:28 And @] lived in the land of @- @Hteen @8: so the
whole age of @] was an @/ forty and @H @8.

47:29 And the time drew nigh that @ must die: and he @, his

put, I pray thee, thy hand @[ my thigh, and deal kindly and truly
with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in @-: 47:30 But I will lie with
my @s, and thou @ carry me out of @-, and bury me in @
burying@'. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And @
bowed @9 upon the bed's head.

48:1 And it came to pass @ @ @, that one told Joseph,
@., thy @ is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim.

48:2 And one told @], and said, @., thy son Joseph cometh unto

48:3 And @] said unto Joseph, God Al@By appeared unto me at Luz
in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, @.,
I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee
a multitude of @; and will give this land to thy seed @ thee
for an everlasting possession.

48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, @ were born unto

48:6 And thy issue, @ thou begettest @ them, @ be @,

48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
land of Canaan in the way, when yet @ was but a little way to come
unto Ephrath: and I buried her @ in the way of Ephrath; the same
is Bethlehem.

48:8 And @ beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are @?  48:9
And Joseph said unto his @, They are my sons, whom God hath @=
me in this @'. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I
will bless them.

48:10 Now the eyes of @ were dim for age, so that he could not
see.

And he @ them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
them.

48:11 And @ said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

48:12 And Joseph @ them out from between his knees, and he bowed
@9 with his face to the @.

48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his @c hand toward
@'s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward @'s
@c hand, and @ them near unto him.

48:14 And @ stretched out his @c hand, and laid it upon
Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's
head, guiding his @D wittingly; for Manasseh was the @Oborn.

48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, @	 whom my @s
Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God @ fed me all my life long unto
this day, 48:16 The Angel @ redeemed me from all evil, bless the
lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my @s
Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the @a of
the @.

48:17 And when Joseph saw that his @ laid his @c hand upon the
head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his @'s hand,
to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

48:18 And Joseph said unto his @, Not so, my @: for this is
the @Oborn; put thy @c hand upon his head.

48:19 And his @ refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:
he also @ become a @, and he also @ be @: but truly
his younger @X @ be @er than he, and his seed @
become a multitude of nations.

48:20 And he blessed them that day, @, In thee @ @

Ephraim @	 Manasseh.

48:21 And @ said unto Joseph, @., I die: but God @ be

48:22 Moreover I have @= to thee one portion above thy @3,
@ I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my @Q and with my

49:1 And @] @, unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves

49:2 Gather yourselves @?, and hear, ye sons of @]; and
hearken unto @ your @.

49:3 Reuben, thou art my @Oborn, my @B, and the beginning of my

Unstable as @Z, thou @ not excel; @ thou wentest up to

49:5 Simeon and Levi are @3; instruments of cruelty are in @
habitations.

49:6 O my soul, come not thou into @ secret; unto @ assembly,
mine honour, be not thou united: for in @ anger they slew a man,
and in @ selfwill they digged down a wall.

49:7 Cursed be @ anger, for it was fierce; and @ wrath, for it

49:8 @, thou art he whom thy @3 @ praise: thy hand @

49:9 @ is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:

49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the

49:13 Zebulun @ dwell at the haven of the sea; and he @ be for

49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
pleasant; and bowed his @#er to bear, and became a @< unto

49:16 Dan @ judge his @, as one of the tribes of @.

49:17 Dan @ be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that

49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

49:19 Gad, a troop @ overcome him: but he @ overcome at the

49:20 Out of Asher his @d @ be fat, and he @ yield royal
dainties.

49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly @5.

49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely
grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode
in strength, and the arms of his @D were made strong by the @D
of the @By God of @]; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of

49:27 Benjamin @ ravin as a wolf: in the morning he @ devour

49:28 All @ are the twelve tribes of @: and this is it that

49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be ga@d

bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a

49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; @ they buried

49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is @in was
from the @ of Heth.

49:33 And when @] had made an end of commanding his sons, he
ga@d up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was

50:1 And Joseph fell upon his @'s face, and wept upon him, and

50:2 And Joseph @M his @<s the physicians to embalm his

50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the
days of @J @ are embalmed: and the @-ians mourned for him

50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph @0 unto
the @ of Pharaoh, @, If now I have @V grace in your eyes,

50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy @, @$ as he

50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his @: and with him went up all

@3, and his @'s @: only @ little ones, and @
flocks, and @ herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

50:9 And @ went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was
a very @ company.

50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, @ is beyond
Jordan, and @ they mourned with a @ and very sore lamentation:
and he made a mourning for his @ @H days.

50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the

to the @-ians: wherefore the name of it was @, Abelmizraim,
@ is beyond Jordan.

50:12 And his sons did unto him @$ as he @M them: 50:13
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah, @ Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a burying@' of Ephron the Hittite, @	
Mamre.

50:14 And Joseph returned into @-, he, and his @3, and all

50:15 And when Joseph's @3 saw that @ @ was dead, they
said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
all the evil @ we did unto him.

50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, @, Thy @ did
command @	 he died, @, 50:17 So @ ye say unto Joseph,
Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy @3, and @ sin;
for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the

when they @0 unto him.

50:18 And his @3 also went and fell down @	 his face; and
they said, @., we be thy @<s.

50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the @' of
God?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil @

50:21 Now @fore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little

And he comforted them, and @0 kindly unto them.

50:22 And Joseph dwelt in @-, he, and his @'s @: and
Joseph lived an @/ and ten @8.

50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's @ of the third generation: the
@ also of Machir the son of Manasseh were @ up upon

50:24 And Joseph said unto his @3, I die: and God will surely

50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the @ of @, @, God

1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of @] were @Hty

1:6 And Joseph died, and all his @3, and all that generation.

1:7 And the @ of @ were fruitful, and increased

1:8 Now @ arose up a new king over @-, @ knew not Joseph.

@
 us, and so get them up out of the land.

1:11 @N they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with

Raamses.

1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and

And they were grieved @ of the @ of @.

1:13 And the @-ians made the @ of @ to serve with

1:15 And the king of @- @0 to the Hebrew midwives, of @ the

1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of @-

1:18 And the king of @- @, for the midwives, and said unto

1:20 @N God dealt well with the midwives: and the @

2:1 And @ went a man of the @ of Levi, and took to wife a

2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of

2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went
and @, the child's m@C.

2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took
the child, and nursed it.

2:10 And the child grew, and she @ him unto Pharaoh's daughter,
and he became her son. And she @, his name @: and she said,
Because I drew him out of the @Z.

2:11 And it came to pass in @J days, when @ was grown, that he
went out unto his @3, and looked on @ burdens: and he spied
an @-ian smiting an Hebrew, one of his @3.

2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that @
was no man, he slew the @-ian, and hid him in the sand.

2:13 And when he went out the second day, @%, two men of the
Hebrews strove @?: and he said to him that did the wrong,
Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a
prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou
killedst the @-ian? And @ feared, and said, Surely this @7
is known.

2:15 Now when Pharaoh @) this @7, he sought to slay @. But
@ fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
and he sat down by a well.

2:16 Now the @6 of Midian had @H daughters: and they came and
drew @Z, and filled the troughs to @Z @ @'s flock.

2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but @ stood up
and helped them, and @Zed @ flock.

2:18 And when they came to Reuel @ @, he said, How is it that
ye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An @-ian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew @Z enough for
us, and @Zed the flock.

2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat @d.

2:21 And @ was content to dwell with the man: and he gave @
Zipporah his daughter.

2:22 And she bare him a son, and he @, his name Gershom: for he
said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of @-
died: and the @ of @ sighed by reason of the bondage, and
they cried, and @ cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

2:24 And God @) @ groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with @].

2:25 And God looked upon the @ of @, and God had respect
unto them.

3:1 Now @ kept the flock of Jethro his @ in law, the @6
of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and
came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
of the @a of a bush: and he looked, and, @%, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

3:3 And @ said, I will now turn aside, and see this @ sight,
why the bush is not @_.

3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God @, unto
him out of the @a of the bush, and said, @, @. And he said,
Here am I.

3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
feet, for the @' whereon thou standest is holy ground.

3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy @, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of @]. And @ hid his face; for he
was afraid to look upon God.

3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my @
@ are in @-, and have @) @ cry by reason of @
taskmasters; for I know @ sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to
deliver them out of the hand of the @-ians, and to @( them up
out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing
with milk and honey; unto the @' of the Canaanites, and the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and
the Jebusites.

3:9 Now @fore, @%, the cry of the @ of @ is come
unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the @-ians
oppress them.

3:10 Come now @fore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
mayest @( @ my @ the @ of @ out of @-.

3:11 And @ said unto God, Who am I, that I @# go unto Pharaoh,
and that I @# @( @ the @ of @ out of @-?
3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this @ be a
token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast @ @

3:13 And @ said unto God, @., when I come unto the @ of
@, and @ say unto them, The God of your @s hath sent me

Thus @ thou say unto the @ of @, I AM hath sent me

3:15 And God said moreover unto @, Thus @ thou say unto the
@ of @, the LORD God of your @s, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of @], hath sent me unto you: this is
my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

3:16 Go, and gather the elders of @ @?, and say unto them,
The LORD God of your @s, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of

3:18 And they @ hearken to thy @;: and thou @ come, thou

3:19 And I am sure that the king of @- will not let you go, no, not

3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite @- with all my
wonders @ I will do in the @a @of: and @ that he will

3:21 And I will give this @ favour in the sight of the @-ians:

3:22 But @ woman @ borrow of her neighbour, and of her that

4:1 And @ @> and said, But, @%, they will not believe
me, nor hearken unto my @;: for they will say, The LORD hath not
appeared unto thee.

4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in @ hand? And he
said, A rod.

4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
and it became a serpent; and @ fled from @	 it.

4:4 And the LORD said unto @, Put @ @ hand, and take it by
the tail. And he put @ his hand, and caught it, and it became a
rod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of @
@s, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of @],
hath appeared unto thee.

4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now @ hand into
thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it
out, @%, his hand was leprous as snow.

4:7 And he said, Put @ hand into thy bosom @*. And he put his

@%, it was turned @* as his @C @R.

4:8 And it @ come to pass, if they will not believe thee, @"

4:9 And it @ come to pass, if they will not believe also @ two

4:10 And @ said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
@" heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy @<: but I
am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's @P? or who

LORD?  4:12 Now @fore go, and I will be with thy @P, and teach
thee what thou @ say.

4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send.

4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 @, and he said,
Is not Aaron the Levite thy @X? I know that he can @K well.
And also, @%, he cometh @ to meet thee: and when he seeth

4:15 And thou @ @K unto him, and put @5 in his @P: and I

4:16 And he @ be thy spokesman unto the @: and he @ be,

4:17 And thou @ take this rod in @ hand, wherewith thou @

4:18 And @ went and returned to Jethro his @ in law, and said
unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my @3 @

@, Go in @U.

4:19 And the LORD said unto @ in Midian, Go, return into @-:
for all the men are dead @ sought thy life.

4:20 And @ took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,
and he returned to the land of @-: and @ took the rod of God in
his hand.

4:21 And the LORD said unto @, When thou goest to return into
@-, see that thou do all @J wonders @	 Pharaoh, @ I have
put in @ hand: but I will harden his @, that he @ not let

4:22 And thou @ say unto Pharaoh, Thus @
 the LORD, @ is
my son, even my @Oborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,
that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, @%, I will
slay thy son, even thy @Oborn.

4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,
and sought to kill him.

4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a @Iy husband art
thou to me.

4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A @Iy husband thou art,
@ of the circumcision.

4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet @.
And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

4:28 And @ told Aaron all the @5 of the LORD who had sent him,
and all the signs @ he had @M him.

4:29 And @ and Aaron went and ga@d @? all the elders of
the @ of @: 4:30 And Aaron @0 all the @5 @ the
LORD had spoken unto @, and did the signs in the sight of the
@.

4:31 And the @ believed: and when they @) that the LORD had
visited the @ of @, and that he had looked upon @
affliction, then they bowed @ heads and worshipped.

5:1 And @ward @ and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
@
 the LORD God of @, Let my @ go, that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness.

5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I @# obey his @; to
let @ go? I know not the LORD, @" will I let @ go.

5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,
we pray thee, @@ days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto
the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the
@Q.

5:4 And the king of @- said unto them, Wherefore do ye, @ and
Aaron, let the @ from @ works? get you unto your burdens.

5:5 And Pharaoh said, @., the @ of the land now are many, and
ye make them rest from @ burdens.

5:6 And Pharaoh @M the same day the taskmasters of the @,
and @ officers, @, 5:7 Ye @ no more give the @ straw
to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for
@T.

5:8 And the tale of the bricks, @ they did make heretofore, ye

idle; @fore they cry, @, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

5:9 Let @ more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
@in; and let them not regard vain @5.

5:10 And the taskmasters of the @ went out, and @ officers,
and they @0 to the @, @, Thus @
 Pharaoh, I will not
give you straw.

5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
work @ be diminished.

5:12 So the @ were scattered abroad @Eout all the land of
@- to gather stubble instead of straw.

5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, @, Fulfil your works, your
daily tasks, as when @ was straw.

5:14 And the officers of the @ of @, @ Pharaoh's
taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
day, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the @ of @
came and cried unto Pharaoh, @, Wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy @<s?  5:16 There is no straw @= unto thy @<s, and
they say to us, Make brick: and, @%, thy @<s are beaten; but
the fault is in @ own @.

5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: @fore ye say, Let us

5:18 Go @fore now, and work; for @ @ no straw be @=

5:19 And the officers of the @ of @ did see that they were
in evil case, @ it was said, Ye @ not minish ought from your
bricks of your daily task.

5:20 And they met @ and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
@ from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon
you, and judge; @ ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the
eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his @<s, to put a @Q in
@ hand to slay us.

5:22 And @ returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast
thou so evil entreated this @? why is it that thou hast sent me?
5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to @K in thy name, he hath done
evil to this @; @" hast thou delivered thy @ at all.

6:1 Then the LORD said unto @, Now @ thou see what I will do
to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand @ he let them go, and with a
strong hand @ he drive them out of his land.

6:2 And God @0 unto @, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3
And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto @], by the name
of God Al@By, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them
the land of Canaan, the land of @ pilgrimage, wherein they were

6:5 And I have also @) the groaning of the @ of @, whom

6:6 Wherefore say unto the @ of @, I am the LORD, and I

6:8 And I will @( you in unto the land, concerning the @ I did

6:9 And @ @0 so unto the @ of @: but they hearkened
not unto @ for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

6:10 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 6:11 Go in, @K unto
Pharaoh king of @-, that he let the @ of @ go out of

6:12 And @ @0 @	 the LORD, @, @., the @ of

6:26 These are that Aaron and @, to whom the LORD said, Bring out

6:30 And @ said @	 the LORD, @., I am of uncircumcised

7:2 Thou @ @K all that I command thee: and Aaron thy @X

7:8 And the LORD @0 unto @ and unto Aaron, @, 7:9 When

7:10 And @ and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the

@	 his @<s, and it became a serpent.

7:11 Then Pharaoh also @, the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
magicians of @-, they also did in like manner with @

7:12 For they cast down @ man his rod, and they became serpents:
but Aaron's rod swallowed up @ rods.

7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's @, that he hearkened not unto them;
as the LORD had said.

7:14 And the LORD said unto @, Pharaoh's @ is hardened, he

7:20 And @ and Aaron did so, as the LORD @M; and he lifted

of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his @<s; and all the @Zs that

8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the @Zs of @-; and the

our God.

8:11 And the frogs @ depart from thee, and from thy @s, and
from thy @<s, and from thy @; they @ remain in the river
only.

8:12 And @ and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and @ cried unto
the LORD @ of the frogs @ he had @ @
 Pharaoh.

8:13 And the LORD did @$ to the word of @; and the frogs
died out of the @s, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

8:14 And they ga@d them @? upon heaps: and the land stank.

8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that @ was respite, he hardened his
@, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

8:16 And the LORD said unto @, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
@Eout all the land of @-.

8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
and smote the dust of the @, and it became lice in man, and in
beast; all the dust of the land became lice @Eout all the land of
@-.

8:18 And the magicians did so with @ enchantments to @( @
lice, but they could not: so @ were lice upon man, and upon beast.

8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:
and Pharaoh's @ was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as
the LORD had said.

8:20 And the LORD said unto @, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand @	 Pharaoh; lo, he cometh @ to the @Z; and say unto
him, Thus @
 the LORD, Let my @ go, that they may serve me.

8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my @ go, @%, I will send
swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy @<s, and upon thy @,
and into thy @s: and the @s of the @-ians @ be full of
swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in @ my
@ dwell, that no swarms of flies @ be @; to the end thou
mayest know that I am the LORD in the @a of the @.

8:23 And I will put a division between my @ and thy @: to
morrow @ this sign be.

8:24 And the LORD did so; and @ came a grievous swarm of flies
into the @ of Pharaoh, and into his @<s' @s, and into all
the land of @-: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of
flies.

8:25 And Pharaoh @, for @ and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
sacrifice to your God in the land.

8:26 And @ said, It is not meet so to do; for we @ sacrifice
the abomination of the @-ians to the LORD our God: lo, @ we
sacrifice the abomination of the @-ians @	 @ eyes, and will
they not stone us?  8:27 We will go @@ days' journey into the
wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he @ command us.

8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye @ not go very far away:
intreat for me.

8:29 And @ said, @., I go out from thee, and I will intreat
the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
@<s, and from his @, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal
deceitfully any more in not letting the @ go to sacrifice to the
LORD.

8:30 And @ went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

8:31 And the LORD did @$ to the word of @; and he removed
the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his @<s, and from his
@; @ remained not one.

8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his @ at this time also, @" @L
he let the @ go.

9:1 Then the LORD said unto @, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
Thus @
 the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my @ go, that they
may serve me.

9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3
@., the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle @ is in the field,
upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and
upon the sheep: @ @ be a very grievous murrain.

9:4 And the LORD @ sever between the cattle of @ and the
cattle of @-: and @ @ no@7 die of all that is the
@'s of @.

9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, @, To morrow the LORD
@ do this @7 in the land.

9:6 And the LORD did that @7 on the morrow, and all the cattle of
@- died: but of the cattle of the @ of @ died not one.

9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, @%, @ was not one of the cattle of
the @ites dead. And the @ of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did
not let the @ go.

9:8 And the LORD said unto @ and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls
of ashes of the furnace, and let @ sprinkle it toward the @1
in the sight of Pharaoh.

9:9 And it @ become small dust in all the land of @-, and @
be a boil breaking @ with blains upon man, and upon beast,
@Eout all the land of @-.

9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood @	 Pharaoh; and
@ sprinkled it up toward @1; and it became a boil breaking
@ with blains upon man, and upon beast.

9:11 And the magicians could not stand @	 @ @ of the
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
@-ians.

9:12 And the LORD hardened the @ of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto @.

9:13 And the LORD said unto @, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand @	 Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus @
 the LORD God of the
Hebrews, Let my @ go, that they may serve me.

9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon @ @, and
upon thy @<s, and upon thy @; that thou mayest know that
@ is none like me in all the @.

9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
@ with pestilence; and thou @ be cut off from the @.

9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared @Eout all
the @.

9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself @
 my @, that thou wilt
not let them go?  9:18 @., to morrow @+ this time I will cause
it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in @- since
the @Vation @of even until now.

9:19 Send @fore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
in the field; for upon @ man and beast @ @ be @V in the
field, and @ not be @ home, the hail @ come down upon
them, and they @ die.

9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD @ the @<s of Pharaoh
made his @<s and his cattle flee into the @s: 9:21 And he
that regarded not the word of the LORD left his @<s and his
cattle in the field.

9:22 And the LORD said unto @, Stretch @ @ hand toward
@1, that @ may be hail in all the land of @-, upon man, and
upon beast, and upon @ herb of the field, @Eout the land of
@-.

9:23 And @ stretched @ his rod toward @1: and the LORD
sent th@[ and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the
LORD rained hail upon the land of @-.

9:24 So @ was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as @ was none like it in all the land of @- since it
became a nation.

9:25 And the hail smote @Eout all the land of @- all that was
in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote @ herb of the
field, and brake @ tree of the field.

9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the @ of @ were,
was @ no hail.

9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and @, for @ and Aaron, and said unto
them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is @ceous, and I and my
@ are wicked.

9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that @ be no more @By
th@[ings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye @ stay no
longer.

9:29 And @ said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
will spread abroad my @D unto the LORD; and the th@[ @
cease, @" @ @ be any more hail; that thou mayest know how
that the @ is the LORD's.

9:30 But as for thee and thy @<s, I know that ye will not yet
fear the LORD God.

9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
the ear, and the flax was bolled.

9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
grown up.

9:33 And @ went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
his @D unto the LORD: and the th@[s and hail ceased, and the
rain was not poured upon the @.

9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the th@[s
were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his @, he and his
@<s.

9:35 And the @ of Pharaoh was hardened, @" @L he let the
@ of @ go; as the LORD had spoken by @.

10:1 And the LORD said unto @, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
hardened his @, and the @ of his @<s, that I @B shew
@ my signs @	 him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears
of thy son, and of thy son's son, what @ I have wrought in @-,
and my signs @ I have done @ them; that ye may know how that I
am the LORD.

10:3 And @ and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
@
 the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
thyself @	 me? let my @ go, that they may serve me.

10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my @ go, @%, to morrow will
I @( the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they @ cover the face
of the @, that one cannot be able to see the @: and they @
eat the residue of that @ is escaped, @ remaineth unto you
from the hail, and @ eat @ tree @ groweth for you out of
the field: 10:6 And they @ fill thy @s, and the @s of all
thy @<s, and the @s of all the @-ians; @ @" thy
@s, nor thy @s' @s have seen, since the day that they
were upon the @ unto this day. And he turned @9, and went out
from Pharaoh.

10:7 And Pharaoh's @<s said unto him, How long @ this man be
a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD @
God: knowest thou not yet that @- is destroyed?  10:8 And @ and
Aaron were @ @* unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,
serve the LORD your God: but who are they that @ go?  10:9 And
@ said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons
and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;
for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is @	 you.

10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye
did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

10:12 And the LORD said unto @, Stretch out @ hand over the
land of @- for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of
@-, and eat @ herb of the land, even all that the hail hath
left.

10:13 And @ stretched @ his rod over the land of @-, and
the LORD @ an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
night; and when it was morning, the east wind @ the locusts.

10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of @-, and rested in
all the coasts of @-: very grievous were they; @	 them @
were no such locusts as they, @" @ them @ be such.

10:15 For they covered the face of the whole @, so that the land
was darkened; and they did eat @ herb of the land, and all the
fruit of the trees @ the hail had left: and @ remained not any
green @7 in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, @E all
the land of @-.

10:16 Then Pharaoh @, for @ and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
have sinned @
 the LORD your God, and @
 you.

10:17 Now @fore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this @^
only.

10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

10:19 And the LORD turned a @By strong west wind, @ took away
the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; @ remained not one
locust in all the coasts of @-.

10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's @, so that he @L not let
the @ of @ go.

10:21 And the LORD said unto @, Stretch out @ hand toward
@1, that @ may be darkness over the land of @-, even
darkness @ may be felt.

10:22 And @ stretched @ his hand toward @1; and @ was
a thick darkness in all the land of @- @@ days: 10:23 They saw
not one @F, @" rose any from his @' for @@ days: but
all the @ of @ had light in @ dwellings.

10:24 And Pharaoh @, unto @, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;
only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones
also go with you.

10:25 And @ said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and @_
@&s, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

10:26 Our cattle also @ go with us; @ @ not an hoof be
left behind; for @of must we take to serve the LORD our God; and
we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's @, and he @L not let them
go.

10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou
@ die.

10:29 And @ said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face @*
no more.

11:1 And the LORD said unto @, Yet will I @( one plague more
upon Pharaoh, and upon @-; @wards he will let you go hence:
when he @ let you go, he @ surely thrust you out hence
al@?.

11:2 Speak now in the ears of the @, and let @ man borrow of
his neighbour, and @ woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and
jewels of gold.

11:3 And the LORD gave the @ favour in the sight of the
@-ians.

Moreover the man @ was very @ in the land of @-, in the
sight of Pharaoh's @<s, and in the sight of the @.

11:4 And @ said, Thus @
 the LORD, About midnight will I go out
into the @a of @-: 11:5 And all the @Oborn in the land of
@- @ die, from the @O born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his
throne, even unto the @Oborn of the maid@< that is behind the

11:6 And @ @ be a @ cry @Eout all the land of @-,
such as @ was none like it, nor @ be like it any more.

11:7 But @
 any of the @ of @ @ not a dog move
his tongue, @
 man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD
doth put a difference between the @-ians and @.

11:8 And all @ thy @<s @ come down unto me, and bow down
@T unto me, @, Get thee out, and all the @ that
follow thee: and @ that I will go out. And he went out from
Pharaoh in a @ anger.

11:9 And the LORD said unto @, Pharaoh @ not hearken unto you;
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of @-.

11:10 And @ and Aaron did all @ wonders @	 Pharaoh: and
the LORD hardened Pharaoh's @, so that he @L not let the
@ of @ go out of his land.

12:1 And the LORD @0 unto @ and Aaron in the land of @-
@, 12:2 This month @ be unto you the beginning of months: it
@ be the @O month of the year to you.

12:3 Speak ye unto all the @` of @, @, In the
tenth day of this month they @ take to them @ man a lamb,
@$ to the @ of @ @s, a lamb for an @: 12:4 And
if the @hold be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour

@ man @$ to his eating @ make your count for the lamb.

12:5 Your lamb @ be @S blemish, a male of the @O year: ye
@ take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye @
keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole
assembly of the @` of @ @ kill it in the evening.

12:7 And they @ take of the @I, and strike it on the two side
posts and on the upper door post of the @s, wherein they @ eat
it.

12:8 And they @ eat the @R in that night, roast with fire, and
unleavened @d; and with bitter herbs they @ eat it.

12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with @Z, but roast with
fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance @of.

12:10 And ye @ let no@7 of it remain until the morning; and
that @ remaineth of it until the morning ye @ burn with fire.

12:11 And thus @ ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on
your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye @ eat it in haste:
it is the LORD's passover.

12:12 For I will pass @E the land of @- this night, and will
smite all the @Oborn in the land of @-, both man and beast; and
@
 all the gods of @- I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

12:13 And the @I @ be to you for a token upon the @s where
ye are: and when I see the @I, I will pass over you, and the plague
@ not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of @-.

12:14 And this day @ be unto you for a memorial; and ye @ keep
it a feast to the LORD @Eout your generations; ye @ keep it a
feast by an ordinance for ever.

12:15 Seven days @ ye eat unleavened @d; even the @O day ye
@ put away leaven out of your @s: for whosoever eateth
leavened @d from the @O day until the @Hth day, that soul
@ be cut off from @.

12:16 And in the @O day @ @ be an holy convocation, and in
the @Hth day @ @ be an holy convocation to you; no manner
of work @ be done in them, save that @ @ man must eat,
that only may be done of you.

12:17 And ye @ observe the feast of unleavened @d; for in this
selfsame day have I @ your armies out of the land of @-:
@fore @ ye observe this day in your generations by an
ordinance for ever.

12:18 In the @O month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,
ye @ eat unleavened @d, until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even.

12:19 Seven days @ @ be no leaven @V in your @s: for
whosoever eateth that @ is leavened, even that soul @ be cut
off from the @` of @, whether he be a stranger, or born

12:20 Ye @ eat no@7 leavened; in all your habitations @ ye
eat unleavened @d.

12:21 Then @ @, for all the elders of @, and said unto
them, Draw out and take you a lamb @$ to your families, and
kill the passover.

12:22 And ye @ take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the @I
that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts
with the @I that is in the bason; and none of you @ go out at
the door of his @ until the morning.

12:23 For the LORD will pass @E to smite the @-ians; and when
he seeth the @I upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the
LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to
come in unto your @s to smite you.

12:24 And ye @ observe this @7 for an ordinance to thee and to
thy sons for ever.

12:25 And it @ come to pass, when ye be come to the land @ the
LORD will give you, @$ as he hath promised, that ye @ keep
this service.

12:26 And it @ come to pass, when your @ @ say unto
you, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye @ say, It is the
sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the @s of the
@ of @ in @-, when he smote the @-ians, and
delivered our @s. And the @ bowed the head and worshipped.

12:28 And the @ of @ went away, and did as the LORD had
@M @ and Aaron, so did they.

12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
@Oborn in the land of @-, from the @Oborn of Pharaoh that sat
on his throne unto the @Oborn of the captive that was in the
dungeon; and all the @Oborn of cattle.

12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his @<s, and
all the @-ians; and @ was a @ cry in @-; for @ was
not a @ where @ was not one dead.

12:31 And he @, for @ and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
and get you @ from @ my @, both ye and the @ of
@; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
gone; and bless me also.

12:33 And the @-ians were urgent upon the @, that they @B
send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

12:34 And the @ took @ dough @	 it was leavened, @
kneadingtroughs being bound up in @ clothes upon @ @#ers.

12:35 And the @ of @ did @$ to the word of @;
and they borrowed of the @-ians jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the @ favour in the
sight of the @-ians, so that they lent unto them such @ as
they required. And they spoiled the @-ians.

12:37 And the @ of @ journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
@+ six @/ @: on foot that were men, beside @.

12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
herds, even very much cattle.

12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough @ they @
@ out of @-, for it was not leavened; @ they were thrust
out of @-, and could not tarry, @" had they prepared for
@T any victual.

12:40 Now the sojourning of the @ of @, who dwelt in
@-, was four @/ and thirty @8.

12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four @/ and thirty
@8, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of
the LORD went out from the land of @-.

12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for @(ing
them out from the land of @-: this is that night of the LORD to be
observed of all the @ of @ in @ generations.

12:43 And the LORD said unto @ and Aaron, This is the ordinance of
the passover: There @ no stranger eat @of: 12:44 But @
man's @< that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised

12:45 A foreigner and an hired @< @ not eat @of.

12:46 In one @ @ it be eaten; thou @ not carry @ ought

12:47 All the @` of @ @ keep it.

12:48 And when a stranger @ sojourn with thee, and will keep the
passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
him come near and keep it; and he @ be as one that is born in the
land: for no uncircumcised person @ eat @of.

12:49 One law @ be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
that sojourneth @ you.

12:50 Thus did all the @ of @; as the LORD @M @
and Aaron, so did they.

12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did @(
the @ of @ out of the land of @- by @ armies.

13:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all
the @Oborn, whatsoever openeth the womb @ the @ of
@, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

13:3 And @ said unto the @, Remember this day, in @ ye
came out from @-, out of the @ of bondage; for by strength of
hand the LORD @ you out from this @': @ @ no leavened

13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

13:5 And it @ be when the LORD @ @( thee into the land of

and the Jebusites, @ he sware unto thy @s to give thee, a
land flowing with milk and honey, that thou @ keep this service in
this month.

13:6 Seven days thou @ eat unleavened @d, and in the @Hth
day @ be a feast to the LORD.

13:7 Unleavened @d @ be eaten @H days; and @ @ no
leavened @d be seen with thee, @" @ @ be leaven seen
with thee in all thy quarters.

13:8 And thou @ shew thy son in that day, @, This is done
@ of that @ the LORD did unto me when I came @ out of
@-.

13:9 And it @ be for a sign unto thee upon @ hand, and for a
memorial between @ eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy @P:
for with a strong hand hath the LORD @ thee out of @-.

13:10 Thou @ @fore keep this ordinance in his season from year
to year.

13:11 And it @ be when the LORD @ @( thee into the land of
the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy @s, and @
give it thee, 13:12 That thou @ set apart unto the LORD all that
openeth the matrix, and @ @Oling that cometh of a beast @
thou hast; the males @ be the LORD's.

13:13 And @ @Oling of an ass thou @ redeem with a lamb; and
if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou @ break his neck: and all
the @Oborn of man @ thy @ @ thou redeem.

13:14 And it @ be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
@, What is this? that thou @ say unto him, By strength of
hand the LORD @ us out from @-, from the @ of bondage:
13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh @L hardly let us go, that
the LORD slew all the @Oborn in the land of @-, both the
@Oborn of man, and the @Oborn of beast: @fore I sacrifice to
the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the
@Oborn of my @ I redeem.

13:16 And it @ be for a token upon @ hand, and for frontlets
between @ eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD @ us @
out of @-.

13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the @ go, that
God led them not @E the way of the land of the Philistines,
although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the @
repent when they see war, and they return to @-: 13:18 But God led
the @ @+, @E the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:
and the @ of @ went up harnessed out of the land of @-.

13:19 And @ took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
sworn the @ of @, @, God will surely visit you; and
ye @ carry up my bones away hence with you.

13:20 And they took @ journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
in the edge of the wilderness.

13:21 And the LORD went @	 them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them
light; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from @	 the
@.

14:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 14:2 Speak unto the
@ of @, that they turn and encamp @	 Pihahiroth,
between Migdol and the sea, over @
 Baalzephon: @	 it @
ye encamp by the sea.

14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the @ of @, They are
entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's @, that he @ follow @
them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that
the @-ians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

14:5 And it was told the king of @- that the @ fled: and the
@ of Pharaoh and of his @<s was turned @
 the @,
and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let @ go from
serving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his @
with him: 14:7 And he took six @/ chosen chariots, and all the
chariots of @-, and captains over @ one of them.

14:8 And the LORD hardened the @ of Pharaoh king of @-, and he
pursued @ the @ of @: and the @ of @ went
out with an high hand.

14:9 But the @-ians pursued @ them, all the horses and chariots
of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them
encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, @	 Baalzephon.

14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the @ of @ lifted up
@ eyes, and, @%, the @-ians marched @ them; and they
were sore afraid: and the @ of @ cried out unto the LORD.

14:11 And they said unto @, Because @ were no graves in @-,
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us, to carry us @ out of @-?  14:12 Is not this
the word that we did tell thee in @-, @, Let us alone, that we
may serve the @-ians? For it had been better for us to serve the
@-ians, than that we @# die in the wilderness.

14:13 And @ said unto the @, Fear ye not, stand still, and
see the salvation of the LORD, @ he will shew to you to day: for
the @-ians whom ye have seen to day, ye @ see them @* no
more for ever.

14:14 The LORD @ fight for you, and ye @ hold your @U.

14:15 And the LORD said unto @, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
@K unto the @ of @, that they go forward: 14:16 But
lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out @ hand over the sea, and
divide it: and the @ of @ @ go on dry ground @E
the @a of the sea.

14:17 And I, @%, I will harden the @s of the @-ians, and
they @ follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and
upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

14:18 And the @-ians @ know that I am the LORD, when I have
gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
horsemen.

14:19 And the angel of God, @ went @	 the camp of @,
removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from
@	 @ face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between
the camp of the @-ians and the camp of @; and it was a cloud
and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to @: so that the
one came not near the @C all the night.

14:21 And @ stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and
made the sea dry land, and the @Zs were divided.

14:22 And the @ of @ went into the @a of the sea upon
the dry ground: and the @Zs were a wall unto them on @ @c
hand, and on @ left.

14:23 And the @-ians pursued, and went in @ them to the @a
of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
unto the host of the @-ians @E the pillar of fire and of the
cloud, and troubled the host of the @-ians, 14:25 And took off
@ chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the
@-ians said, Let us flee from the face of @; for the LORD
fighteth for them @
 the @-ians.

14:26 And the LORD said unto @, Stretch out @ hand over the
sea, that the @Zs may come @* upon the @-ians, upon @
chariots, and upon @ horsemen.

14:27 And @ stretched @ his hand over the sea, and the sea
returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the @-ians
fled @
 it; and the LORD overthrew the @-ians in the @a of
the sea.

14:28 And the @Zs returned, and covered the chariots, and the
horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea @
them; @ remained not so much as one of them.

14:29 But the @ of @ walked upon dry land in the @a of
the sea; and the @Zs were a wall unto them on @ @c hand, and
on @ left.

14:30 Thus the LORD saved @ that day out of the hand of the
@-ians; and @ saw the @-ians dead upon the sea shore.

14:31 And @ saw that @ work @ the LORD did upon the
@-ians: and the @ feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and
his @< @.

15:1 Then sang @ and the @ of @ this song unto the
LORD, and @0, @, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.

15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:
he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my @'s God,
and I will exalt him.

15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
stone.

15:6 Thy @c hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy @c
hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

15:7 And in the @ness of @ excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up @
 thee: thou sentest @ thy wrath, @
consumed them as stubble.

15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the @Zs were ga@d
@?, the floods stood up@c as an heap, and the depths were
congealed in the @ of the sea.

15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
spoil; my lust @ be satisfied upon them; I will draw my @Q, my
hand @ destroy them.

15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
as lead in the @By @Zs.

15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, @ the gods? who is like thee,
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou
stretchedst out thy @c hand, the @ swallowed them.

15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led @ the @ @ thou hast
redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation.

15:14 The @ @ hear, and be afraid: sorrow @ take hold on
the inhabitants of Palestina.

15:15 Then the dukes of Edom @ be amazed; the @By men of Moab,
trembling @ take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
@ melt away.

15:16 Fear and dread @ fall upon them; by the @ness of @
arm they @ be as still as a stone; till thy @ pass over, O
LORD, till the @ pass over, @ thou hast purchased.

15:17 Thou @ @( them in, and plant them in the mountain of
@ inheritance, in the @', O LORD, @ thou hast made for thee
to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, @ thy @D have
established.

15:18 The LORD @ reign for ever and ever.

15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the LORD @ @* the @Zs of the
sea upon them; but the @ of @ went on dry land in the
@a of the sea.

15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
in her hand; and all the women went out @ her with timbrels and
with dances.

15:21 And Miriam @> them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.

15:22 So @ @ @ from the Red sea, and they went out into
the wilderness of Shur; and they went @@ days in the wilderness,
and @V no @Z.

15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not @b of the @Zs
of Marah, for they were bitter: @fore the name of it was @,
Marah.

15:24 And the @ murmured @
 @, @, What @ we
@b?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a
tree, @ when he had cast into the @Zs, the @Zs were made
sweet: @ he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and @ he
proved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the
@; of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that @ is @c in his
sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
statutes, I will put none of @ diseases upon thee, @ I have
@ upon the @-ians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.

15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of @Z, and
@@score and ten palm trees: and they encamped @ by the @Zs.

16:1 And they took @ journey from Elim, and all the @`
of the @ of @ came unto the wilderness of Sin, @ is
between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month @
@ departing out of the land of @-.

16:2 And the whole @` of the @ of @ murmured
@
 @ and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the @ of
@ said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the
LORD in the land of @-, when we sat by the @R pots, and when we
did eat @d to the full; for ye have @ us @ into this
wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

16:4 Then said the LORD unto @, @., I will rain @d from
@1 for you; and the @ @ go out and gather a certain rate
@ day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or
no.

16:5 And it @ come to pass, that on the sixth day they @
prepare that @ they @( in; and it @ be twice as much as
they gather daily.

16:6 And @ and Aaron said unto all the @ of @, At
even, then ye @ know that the LORD hath @ you out from the
land of @-: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye @ see the @Y of
the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings @
 the LORD: and
what are we, that ye murmur @
 us?  16:8 And @ said, This
@ be, when the LORD @ give you in the evening @R to eat,
and in the morning @d to the full; for that the LORD heareth your
murmurings @ ye murmur @
 him: and what are we? your
murmurings are not @
 us, but @
 the LORD.

16:9 And @ @0 unto Aaron, Say unto all the @` of the
@ of @, Come near @	 the LORD: for he hath @) your
murmurings.

16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron @0 unto the whole @`
of the @ of @, that they looked toward the wilderness,
and, @%, the @Y of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

16:11 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 16:12 I have @) the
murmurings of the @ of @: @K unto them, @, At even
ye @ eat @R, and in the morning ye @ be filled with @d;
and ye @ know that I am the LORD your God.

16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round @+ the host.

16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, @%, upon the face of
the wilderness @ lay a small round @7, as small as the hoar
frost on the ground.

16:15 And when the @ of @ saw it, they said one to
@F, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And @ said
unto them, This is the @d @ the LORD hath @= you to eat.

16:16 This is the @7 @ the LORD hath @M, Gather of it
@ man @$ to his eating, an omer for @ man, @$ to
the number of your persons; take ye @ man for them @ are in
his tents.

16:17 And the @ of @ did so, and ga@d, some more, some
less.

16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that ga@d much
had no@7 over, and he that ga@d little had no lack; they
ga@d @ man @$ to his eating.

16:19 And @ said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto @; but some of them
left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and @
was wroth with them.

16:21 And they ga@d it @ morning, @ man @$ to his
eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they ga@d twice
as much @d, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
@` came and told @.

16:23 And he said unto them, This is that @ the LORD hath said, To
morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that @
ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that @
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as @ bade: and it did
not stink, @" was @ any worm @in.

16:25 And @ said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
the LORD: to day ye @ not find it in the field.

16:26 Six days ye @ gather it; but on the @Hth day, @ is
the sabbath, in it @ @ be none.

16:27 And it came to pass, that @ went out some of the @ on
the @Hth day for to gather, and they @V none.

16:28 And the LORD said unto @, How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath @= you
the sabbath, @fore he giveth you on the sixth day the @d of two
days; abide ye @ man in his @', let no man go out of his @'
on the @Hth day.

16:30 So the @ rested on the @Hth day.

16:31 And the @ of @ @, the name @of Manna: and it
was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey.

16:32 And @ said, This is the @7 @ the LORD commandeth,
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see
the @d wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I @
you @ from the land of @-.

16:33 And @ said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
manna @in, and lay it up @	 the LORD, to be kept for your
generations.

16:34 As the LORD @M @, so Aaron laid it up @	 the
Testimony, to be kept.

16:35 And the @ of @ did eat manna forty @8, until they
came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
borders of the land of Canaan.

16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

17:1 And all the @` of the @ of @ journeyed from
the wilderness of Sin, @ @ journeys, @$ to the
commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and @ was no
@Z for the @ to @b.

17:2 Wherefore the @ did chide with @, and said, Give us
@Z that we may @b. And @ said unto them, Why chide ye with
me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the @ thirsted
@ for @Z; and the @ murmured @
 @, and said,
Wherefore is this that thou hast @ us up out of @-, to kill
us and our @ and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And @ cried
unto the LORD, @, What @ I do unto this @? they be
almost ready to stone me.

17:5 And the LORD said unto @, Go on @	 the @, and take
with thee of the elders of @; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest
the river, take in @ hand, and go.

17:6 @., I will stand @	 thee @ upon the rock in Horeb;
and thou @ smite the rock, and @ @ come @Z out of it,
that the @ may @b. And @ did so in the sight of the elders
of @.

17:7 And he @, the name of the @' Massah, and Meribah, @
of the chiding of the @ of @, and @ they tempted the
LORD, @, Is the LORD @ us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,
and fought with @ in Rephidim.

17:9 And @ said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of God in mine hand.

17:10 So Joshua did as @ had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
and @, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

17:11 And it came to pass, when @ held up his hand, that @
prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

17:12 But @ @D were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
@[ him, and he sat @on; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his @D,
the one on the one side, and the @C on the @C side; and his
@D were steady until the going down of the sun.

17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his @ with the edge of
the @Q.

17:14 And the LORD said unto @, Write this for a memorial in a
book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from @[ @1.

17:15 And @ built an @\, and @, the name of it
Jehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the
LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

18:1 When Jethro, the @6 of Midian, @' @ in law, @) of
all that God had done for @, and for @ his @, and that
the LORD had @ @ out of @-; 18:2 Then Jethro, @'
@ in law, took Zipporah, @' wife, @ he had sent her back,
18:3 And her two sons; of @ the name of the one was Gershom; for
he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of
the @C was Eliezer; for the God of my @, said he, was mine
help, and delivered me from the @Q of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,
@' @ in law, came with his sons and his wife unto @ into
the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he
said unto @, I thy @ in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy
wife, and her two sons with her.

18:7 And @ went out to meet his @ in law, and did obeisance,
and kissed him; and they asked each @C of @ welfare; and they
came into the tent.

18:8 And @ told his @ in law all that the LORD had done unto
Pharaoh and to the @-ians for @'s sake, and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.

18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness @ the LORD had done
to @, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the @-ians.

18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
of the hand of the @-ians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the @ from @[ the hand of the @-ians.

18:11 Now I know that the LORD is @er than all gods: for in the
@7 wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

18:12 And Jethro, @' @ in law, took a @_ @& and
sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of @, to
eat @d with @' @ in law @	 God.

18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that @ sat to judge the
@: and the @ stood by @ from the morning unto the
evening.

18:14 And when @' @ in law saw all that he did to the @,
he said, What is this @7 that thou doest to the @? why sittest
thou thyself alone, and all the @ stand by thee from morning unto
even?  18:15 And @ said unto his @ in law, Because the @
come unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they
come unto me; and I judge between one and @F, and I do make them
know the statutes of God, and his laws.

18:17 And @' @ in law said unto him, The @7 that thou
doest is not good.

18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this @ that is
with thee: for this @7 is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone.

18:19 Hearken now unto my @;, I will give thee counsel, and God
@ be with thee: Be thou for the @ to God-ward, that thou
mayest @( the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou @ teach them
ordinances and laws, and @ shew them the way wherein they must
walk, and the work that they must do.

18:21 Moreover thou @ provide out of all the @ able men, such
as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and @' such over
them, to be rulers of @:s, and rulers of @/s, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the @ at
all seasons: and it @ be, that @ @ matter they @ @(
unto thee, but @ small matter they @ judge: so @ it be
easier for thyself, and they @ bear the burden with thee.

18:23 If thou @ do this @7, and God command thee so, then thou
@ be able to endure, and all this @ @ also go to @
@' in @U.

18:24 So @ hearkened to the @; of his @ in law, and did
all that he had said.

18:25 And @ chose able men out of all @, and made them heads
over the @, rulers of @:s, rulers of @/s, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens.

18:26 And they judged the @ at all seasons: the hard causes they
@ unto @, but @ small matter they judged @T.

18:27 And @ let his @ in law depart; and he went his way into
his own land.

19:1 In the third month, when the @ of @ were gone @
out of the land of @-, the same day came they into the wilderness
of Sinai.

19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert
of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and @ @ camped
@	 the mount.

19:3 And @ went up unto God, and the LORD @, unto him out of
the mountain, @, Thus @ thou say to the @ of @], and
tell the @ of @; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the
@-ians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and @ you unto
myself.

19:5 Now @fore, if ye will obey my @; indeed, and keep my
covenant, then ye @ be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
@: for all the @ is mine: 19:6 And ye @ be unto me a
kingdom of @6s, and an holy nation.

These are the @5 @ thou @ @K unto the @ of
@.

19:7 And @ came and @, for the elders of the @, and laid
@	 @ faces all @ @5 @ the LORD @M him.

19:8 And all the @ @> @?, and said, All that the LORD
hath spoken we will do. And @ returned the @5 of the @
unto the LORD.

19:9 And the LORD said unto @, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
cloud, that the @ may hear when I @K with thee, and believe
thee for ever.

And @ told the @5 of the @ unto the LORD.

19:10 And the LORD said unto @, Go unto the @, and sanctify
them to day and to morrow, and let them wash @ clothes, 19:11 And
be ready @
 the third day: for the third day the LORD will come
down in the sight of all the @ upon mount Sinai.

19:12 And thou @ set bounds unto the @ round @+, @,
Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch
the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount @ be surely put to
@^: 19:13 There @ not an hand touch it, but he @ surely be
stoned, or shot @E; whether it be beast or man, it @ not
live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they @ come up to the mount.

19:14 And @ went down from the mount unto the @, and
sanctified the @; and they washed @ clothes.

19:15 And he said unto the @, Be ready @
 the third day:
come not at your wives.

19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that @
were th@[s and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and
the @; of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the @ that
was in the camp trembled.

19:17 And @ @ @ the @ out of the camp to meet with
God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

19:18 And mount Sinai was al@? on a smoke, @ the LORD
descended upon it in fire: and the smoke @of ascended as the smoke
of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked @ly.

19:19 And when the @; of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
and louder, @ @0, and God @> him by a @;.

19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
mount: and the LORD @, @ up to the top of the mount; and @
went up.

19:21 And the LORD said unto @, Go down, charge the @, lest
they break @E unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

19:22 And let the @6s also, @ come near to the LORD, sanctify
@T, lest the LORD break @ upon them.

19:23 And @ said unto the LORD, The @ cannot come up to mount
Sinai: for thou chargedst us, @, Set bounds @+ the mount, and
sanctify it.

19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou @
come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the @6s and the
@ break @E to come up unto the LORD, lest he break @
upon them.

19:25 So @ went down unto the @, and @0 unto them.

20:1 And God @0 all @ @5, @, 20:2 I am the LORD thy
God, @ have @ thee out of the land of @-, out of the
@ of bondage.

20:3 Thou @ have no @C gods @	 me.

20:4 Thou @ not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
of any @7 that is in @1 above, or that is in the @ beneath,
or that is in the @Z @[ the @.

20:5 Thou @ not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
@s upon the @ unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto @:s of them that love
me, and keep my commandments.

20:7 Thou @ not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

20:9 Six days @ thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the
@Hth day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou @ not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man@<, nor
thy maid@<, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made @1 and @, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the @Hth day: wherefore the
LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

20:12 Honour thy @ and thy m@C: that thy days may be long upon
the land @ the LORD thy God giveth thee.

20:13 Thou @ not kill.

20:14 Thou @ not commit adultery.

20:15 Thou @ not steal.

20:16 Thou @ not bear false witness @
 thy neighbour.

20:17 Thou @ not covet thy neighbour's @, thou @ not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his man@<, nor his maid@<, nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor any @7 that is thy neighbour's.

20:18 And all the @ saw the th@[ings, and the lightnings, and
the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the
@ saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

20:19 And they said unto @, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:
but let not God @K with us, lest we die.

20:20 And @ said unto the @, Fear not: for God is come to
prove you, and that his fear may be @	 your faces, that ye sin
not.

20:21 And the @ stood afar off, and @ drew near unto the
thick darkness where God was.

20:22 And the LORD said unto @, Thus thou @ say unto the
@ of @, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from
@1.

20:23 Ye @ not make with me gods of silver, @" @ ye make
unto you gods of gold.

20:24 An @\ of @ thou @ make unto me, and @ sacrifice
@on thy @_ @&s, and thy @U @&s, thy sheep, and
@ oxen: in all @'s where I record my name I will come unto
thee, and I will bless thee.

20:25 And if thou wilt make me an @\ of stone, thou @ not build
it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast
polluted it.

20:26 Neither @ thou go up by steps unto mine @\, that thy
nakedness be not discovered @on.

21:1 Now @ are the judgments @ thou @ set @	 them.

21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew @<, six @8 he @ serve: and in
the @Hth he @ go out free for no@7.

21:3 If he came in by @9, he @ go out by @9: if he were
married, then his wife @ go out with him.

21:4 If his master have @= him a wife, and she have born him sons
or daughters; the wife and her @ @ be her master's, and he
@ go out by @9.

21:5 And if the @< @ plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
and my @; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master @
@( him unto the judges; he @ also @( him to the door, or
unto the door post; and his master @ bore his ear @E with an
aul; and he @ serve him for ever.

21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid@<, she @ not
go out as the men@<s do.

21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to @9,
then @ he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation
he @ have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he @ deal with her
@ the manner of daughters.

21:10 If he take him @F wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty
of marriage, @ he not diminish.

21:11 And if he do not @ @@ unto her, then @ she go out
free @S money.

21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, @ be surely put to
@^.

21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;
then I will appoint thee a @' whither he @ flee.

21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him
with guile; thou @ take him from mine @\, that he may die.

21:15 And he that smiteth his @, or his m@C, @ be surely
put to @^.

21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be @V
in his hand, he @ surely be put to @^.

21:17 And he that curseth his @, or his m@C, @ surely be
put to @^.

21:18 And if men strive @?, and one smite @F with a stone,
or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he
rise @*, and walk abroad upon his staff, then @ he that smote
him be quit: only he @ pay for the loss of his time, and @
cause him to be thoroughly healed.

21:20 And if a man smite his @<, or his maid, with a rod, and he
die @[ his hand; he @ be surely punished.

21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he @ not be
punished: for he is his money.

21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he @ be surely
punished, @$ as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he
@ pay as the judges determine.

21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou @ give life for life,
21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his @<, or the eye of his
maid, that it perish; he @ let him go free for his eye's sake.

21:27 And if he smite out his man@<'s tooth, or his maid@<'s
tooth; he @ let him go free for his tooth's sake.

21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox @
be surely stoned, and his @R @ not be eaten; but the owner of
the ox @ be quit.

21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and
it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but
that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox @ be stoned, and his
owner also @ be put to @^.

21:30 If @ be laid on him a sum of money, then he @ give for
the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, @$
to this judgment @ it be done unto him.

21:32 If the ox @ push a man@< or a maid@<; he @
give unto @ master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox @ be
stoned.

21:33 And if a man @ open a pit, or if a man @ dig a pit, and
not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall @in; 21:34 The owner of the
pit @ make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the
dead beast @ be his.

21:35 And if one man's ox hurt @F's, that he die; then they @
sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also
they @ divide.

21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
and his owner hath not kept him in; he @ surely pay ox for ox; and
the dead @ be his own.

22:1 If a man @ steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;
he @ restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

22:2 If a thief be @V breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
@ @ no @I be shed for him.

22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, @ @ be @I shed for him;
for he @# make full restitution; if he have no@7, then he @
be sold for his theft.

22:4 If the theft be certainly @V in his hand alive, whether it be
ox, or ass, or sheep; he @ restore double.

22:5 If a man @ cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and @
put in his beast, and @ feed in @F man's field; of the best
of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, @ he make
restitution.

22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed @with; he
that kindled the fire @ surely make restitution.

22:7 If a man @ deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,
and it be stolen out of the man's @; if the thief be @V, let
him pay double.

22:8 If the thief be not @V, then the master of the @ @ be
@ unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his
neighbour's goods.

22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost @7 @ @F
challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties @ come @	 the
judges; and whom the judges @ condemn, he @ pay double unto
his neighbour.

22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,
no man seeing it: 22:11 Then @ an oath of the LORD be between them
both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and
the owner of it @ accept @of, and he @ not make it good.

22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he @ make restitution unto the
owner @of.

22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him @( it for witness, and
he @ not make good that @ was torn.

22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
die, the owner @of being not with it, he @ surely make it
good.

22:15 But if the owner @of be with it, he @ not make it good:
if it be an hired @7, it came for his hire.

22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
her, he @ surely endow her to be his wife.

22:17 If her @ utterly refuse to give her unto him, he @ pay
money @$ to the dowry of virgins.

22:18 Thou @ not suffer a witch to live.

22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast @ surely be put to @^.

22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
@ be utterly destroyed.

22:21 Thou @ @" vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were
strangers in the land of @-.

22:22 Ye @ not afflict any widow, or @less child.

22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I
will surely hear @ cry; 22:24 And my wrath @ wax hot, and I
will kill you with the @Q; and your wives @ be widows, and your
@ @less.

22:25 If thou lend money to any of my @ that is poor by thee,
thou @ not be to him as an usurer, @" @ thou lay upon him
usury.

22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
@ deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For that
is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein @ he
sleep? and it @ come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will
hear; for I am gracious.

22:28 Thou @ not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
@.

22:29 Thou @ not delay to offer the @O of thy ripe fruits, and
of thy liquors: the @Oborn of thy sons @ thou give unto me.

22:30 Likewise @ thou do with @ oxen, and with thy sheep:
@H days it @ be with his dam; on the eighth day thou @ give
it me.

22:31 And ye @ be holy men unto me: @" @ ye eat any @R
that is torn of beasts in the field; ye @ cast it to the dogs.

23:1 Thou @ not raise a false report: put not @ hand with the
wicked to be an un@ceous witness.

23:2 Thou @ not follow a multitude to do evil; @" @ thou
@K in a cause to decline @ many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neither
@ thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

23:4 If thou meet @ enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou @
surely @( it back to him @*.

23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying @[ his
burden, and @Lest forbear to help him, thou @ surely help with
him.

23:6 Thou @ not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and @ceous
slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

23:8 And thou @ take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
perverteth the @5 of the @ceous.

23:9 Also thou @ not oppress a stranger: for ye know the @ of
a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of @-.

23:10 And six @8 thou @ sow thy land, and @ gather in the
fruits @of: 23:11 But the @Hth year thou @ let it rest and
lie still; that the poor of thy @ may eat: and what they leave
the beasts of the field @ eat. In like manner thou @ deal with
thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

23:12 Six days thou @ do thy work, and on the @Hth day thou
@ rest: that @ ox and @ ass may rest, and the son of thy
handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

23:13 And in all @ that I have said unto you be circumspect: and
make no mention of the name of @C gods, @" let it be @) out
of thy @P.

23:14 Three times thou @ keep a feast unto me in the year.

23:15 Thou @ keep the feast of unleavened @d: (thou @ eat
unleavened @d @H days, as I @M thee, in the time
appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from @-: and
none @ appear @	 me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,
the @Ofruits of thy labours, @ thou hast sown in the field: and
the feast of ingathering, @ is in the end of the year, when thou
hast ga@d in thy labours out of the field.

23:17 Three items in the year all thy males @ appear @	 the
LORD God.

23:18 Thou @ not offer the @I of my sacrifice with leavened

23:19 The @O of the @Ofruits of thy land thou @ @( into

23:20 @., I send an Angel @	 thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to @( thee into the @' @ I have prepared.

23:21 Beware of him, and obey his @;, provoke him not; for he will
not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

23:22 But if thou @ indeed obey his @;, and do all that I
@K; then I will be an enemy unto @ enemies, and an adversary
unto @ adversaries.

23:23 For mine Angel @ go @	 thee, and @( thee in unto the
Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,
the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

23:24 Thou @ not bow down to @ gods, nor serve them, nor do
@ @ works: but thou @ utterly overthrow them, and quite
break down @ images.

23:25 And ye @ serve the LORD your God, and he @ bless thy
@d, and thy @Z; and I will take sickness away from the @a of
thee.

23:26 There @ no@7 cast @ young, nor be barren, in thy
land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

23:27 I will send my fear @	 thee, and will destroy all the @

backs unto thee.

23:28 And I will send hornets @	 thee, @ @ drive out the
Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from @	 thee.

23:29 I will not drive them out from @	 thee in one year; lest the
land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply @

thee.

23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from @	 thee,
until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of
the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will
deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou @
drive them out @	 thee.

23:32 Thou @ make no covenant with them, nor with @ gods.

23:33 They @ not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin

24:1 And he said unto @, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,
Nadab, and Abihu, and @Hty of the elders of @; and worship ye

24:2 And @ alone @ come near the LORD: but they @ not come

24:3 And @ came and told the @ all the @5 of the LORD, and

24:4 And @ wrote all the @5 of the LORD, and rose up early in

@$ to the twelve tribes of @.

24:5 And he sent young men of the @ of @, @ offered
@_ @&s, and sacrificed @U @&s of oxen unto the LORD.

24:6 And @ took half of the @I, and put it in basons; and half

24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
the @: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and
be obedient.

24:8 And @ took the @I, and sprinkled it on the @, and
said, @. the @I of the covenant, @ the LORD hath made with
you concerning all @ @5.

24:9 Then went up @, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and @Hty of
the elders of @: 24:10 And they saw the God of @: and @
was @[ his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as
it were the body of @1 in his clearness.

24:11 And upon the nobles of the @ of @ he laid not his

24:12 And the LORD said unto @, Come up to me into the mount, and
be @: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
commandments @ I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

24:13 And @ rose up, and his minister Joshua: and @ went up
into the mount of God.

24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come
@* unto you: and, @%, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man
have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

24:15 And @ went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

24:16 And the @Y of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud
covered it six days: and the @Hth day he @, unto @ out of

24:17 And the sight of the @Y of the LORD was like devouring fire

24:18 And @ went into the @a of the cloud, and gat him up into

29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron @ be his sons' @ him, to

29:30 And that son that is @6 in his stead @ put them on @H

29:31 And thou @ take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his

29:32 And Aaron and his sons @ eat the @R of the ram, and the

29:33 And they @ eat @J @ wherewith the atonement was

29:34 And if ought of the @R of the consecrations, or of the @d,

29:38 Now this is that @ thou @ offer upon the @\; two

29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the @`, and the

30:1 And thou @ make an @\ to burn incense upon: of shittim

30:11 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 30:12 When thou takest
the sum of the @ of @ @ @ number, then @ they

30:13 This they @ give, @ one that passeth @ them that are

30:15 The rich @ not give more, and the poor @ not give less

30:16 And thou @ take the atonement money of the @ of

30:17 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 30:18 Thou @ also

30:21 So they @ wash @ @D and @ feet, that they die

30:22 Moreover the LORD @0 unto @, @, 30:23 Take thou also

30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of

30:34 And the LORD said unto @, Take unto thee sweet spices,

30:38 Whosoever @ make like unto that, to smell @to, @

31:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 31:2 See, I have @, by

31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in

31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
brass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

31:6 And I, @%, I have @= with him Aholiab, the son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the @s of all that are wise
@ed I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have

the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the @\ of incense,
31:9 And the @\ of @_ @& with all his furniture, and the
laver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy

minister in the @6's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and
sweet incense for the holy @': @$ to all that I have

31:12 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 31:13 Speak thou also
unto the @ of @, @, Verily my sabbaths ye @ keep:
for it is a sign between me and you @Eout your generations; that
ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

31:14 Ye @ keep the sabbath @fore; for it is holy unto you:
@ one that defileth it @ surely be put to @^: for whosoever
doeth any work @in, that soul @ be cut off from @ his

31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the @Hth is the sabbath of
rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,
he @ surely be put to @^.

31:16 Wherefore the @ of @ @ keep the sabbath, to
observe the sabbath @Eout @ generations, for a perpetual
covenant.

31:17 It is a sign between me and the @ of @ for ever: for
in six days the LORD made @1 and @, and on the @Hth day he
rested, and was refreshed.

31:18 And he gave unto @, when he had made an end of communing
with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,
written with the finger of God.

32:1 And when the @ saw that @ delayed to come down out of
the mount, the @ ga@d @T @? unto Aaron, and
said unto him, Up, make us gods, @ @ go @	 us; for as for
this @, the man that @ us up out of the land of @-, we
wot not what is become of him.

32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, @
are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,
and @( them unto me.

32:3 And all the @ brake off the golden earrings @ were in
@ ears, and @ them unto Aaron.

32:4 And he received them at @ hand, and fashioned it with a
graving tool, @ he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These
be thy gods, O @, @ @ thee up out of the land of @-.

32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an @\ @	 it; and Aaron
made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered @_
@&s, and @ @U @&s; and the @ sat down to eat
and to @b, and rose up to play.

32:7 And the LORD said unto @, Go, get thee down; for thy @,
@ thou @est out of the land of @-, have corrupted
@T: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way @ I
@M them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped
it, and have sacrificed @unto, and said, These be thy gods, O
@, @ have @ thee up out of the land of @-.

32:9 And the LORD said unto @, I have seen this @, and,
@%, it is a stiffnecked @: 32:10 Now @fore let me alone,
that my wrath may wax hot @
 them, and that I may consume them:
and I will make of thee a @ nation.

32:11 And @ besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
thy wrath wax hot @
 thy @, @ thou hast @ @
out of the land of @- with @ power, and with a @By hand?
32:12 Wherefore @# the @-ians @K, and say, For mischief did
he @( them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them
from the face of the @? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of
this evil @
 thy @.

32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and @, thy @<s, to whom thou
swarest by @ own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your
seed as the stars of @1, and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed, and they @ inherit it for ever.

32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil @ he thought to do unto
his @.

32:15 And @ turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on
both @ sides; on the one side and on the @C were they written.

32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
writing of God, graven upon the tables.

32:17 And when Joshua @) the noise of the @ as they shouted,
he said unto @, There is a noise of war in the camp.

32:18 And he said, It is not the @; of them that shout for mastery,
@" is it the @; of them that cry for being overcome: but the
noise of them that sing do I hear.

32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that
he saw the calf, and the dancing: and @' anger waxed hot, and he
cast the tables out of his @D, and brake them beneath the mount.

32:20 And he took the calf @ they had made, and @_ it in the
fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the @Z, and made
the @ of @ @b of it.

32:21 And @ said unto Aaron, What did this @ unto thee, that
thou hast @ so @ a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let
not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the @, that they
are set on mischief.

32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, @ @ go @	 us:
for as for this @, the man that @ us up out of the land of
@-, we wot not what is become of him.

32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and @ came
out this calf.

32:25 And when @ saw that the @ were naked; (for Aaron had
made them naked unto @ shame @ @ enemies:) 32:26 Then
@ stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's
side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi ga@d
@T @? unto him.

32:27 And he said unto them, Thus @
 the LORD God of @, Put
@ man his @Q by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
@Eout the camp, and slay @ man his @X, and @ man his
companion, and @ man his neighbour.

32:28 And the @ of Levi did @$ to the word of @: and
@ fell of the @ that day @+ @@ @: men.

32:29 For @ had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
even @ man upon his son, and upon his @X; that he may bestow
upon you a blessing this day.

32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that @ said unto the
@, Ye have sinned a @ sin: and now I will go up unto the
LORD; peradventure I @ make an atonement for your sin.

32:31 And @ returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this @ have
sinned a @ sin, and have made them gods of gold.

32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive @ sin--; and if not, blot me,
I pray thee, out of thy book @ thou hast written.

32:33 And the LORD said unto @, Whosoever hath sinned @
 me,
him will I blot out of my book.

32:34 @N now go, lead the @ unto the @' of @ I have
spoken unto thee: @%, mine Angel @ go @	 thee:
nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit @ sin upon them.

32:35 And the LORD plagued the @, @ they made the calf,
@ Aaron made.

33:1 And the LORD said unto @, Depart, and go up hence, thou and
the @ @ thou hast @ up out of the land of @-, unto
the land @ I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to @], @,
Unto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel @	
thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the
Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a
land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the @a of
thee; for thou art a stiffnecked @: lest I consume thee in the
way.

33:4 And when the @ @) @ evil tidings, they mourned: and
no man did put on him his ornaments.

33:5 For the LORD had said unto @, Say unto the @ of
@, Ye are a stiffnecked @: I will come up into the @a of
thee in a moment, and consume thee: @fore now put off thy
ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

33:6 And the @ of @ stripped @T of @ ornaments
by the mount Horeb.

33:7 And @ took the tabernacle, and pitched it @S the camp,
afar off from the camp, and @, it the Tabernacle of the
@`. And it came to pass, that @ one @ sought the
LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the @`, @ was
@S the camp.

33:8 And it came to pass, when @ went out unto the tabernacle,
that all the @ rose up, and stood @ man at his tent door, and
looked @ @, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

33:9 And it came to pass, as @ entered into the tabernacle, the
cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and
the Lord talked with @.

33:10 And all the @ saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
door: and all the @ rose up and worshipped, @ man in his tent
door.

33:11 And the LORD @0 unto @ face to face, as a man @Keth
unto his friend. And he turned @* into the camp: but his @<
Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the
tabernacle.

33:12 And @ said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
this @: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with
me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also @V
grace in my sight.

33:13 Now @fore, I pray thee, if I have @V grace in thy sight,
shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in
thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy @.

33:14 And he said, My presence @ go with thee, and I will give
thee rest.

33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
not up hence.

33:16 For wherein @ it be known here that I and thy @ have
@V grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so
@ we be separated, I and thy @, from all the @ that are
upon the face of the @.

33:17 And the LORD said unto @, I will do this @7 also that
thou hast spoken: for thou hast @V grace in my sight, and I know
thee by name.

33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy @Y.

33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass @	 thee, and I
will proclaim the name of the LORD @	 thee; and will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew
mercy.

33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for @ @ no man
see me, and live.

33:21 And the LORD said, @., @ is a @' by me, and thou
@ stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it @ come to pass, while my
@Y passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and
will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take
away mine hand, and thou @ see my back parts: but my face @
not be seen.

34:1 And the LORD said unto @, Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the @O: and I will write upon @ tables the @5 that were
in the @O tables, @ thou brakest.

34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
mount Sinai, and present thyself @ to me in the top of the mount.

34:3 And no man @ come up with thee, @" let any man be seen
@Eout all the mount; @" let the flocks nor herds feed @	
that mount.

34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the @O; and @
rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the
LORD had @M him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him @,
and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

34:6 And the LORD passed by @	 him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The
LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for @:s, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear
the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the @s upon the @,
and upon the @'s @, unto the third and to the fourth
generation.

34:8 And @ made haste, and bowed his head toward the @, and
worshipped.

34:9 And he said, If now I have @V grace in thy sight, O LORD, let
my LORD, I pray thee, go @ us; for it is a stiffnecked @; and
pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for @ inheritance.

34:10 And he said, @., I make a covenant: @	 all thy @ I
will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the @, nor in
any nation: and all the @ @ @ thou art @ see the work
of the LORD: for it is a terrible @7 that I will do with thee.

34:11 Observe thou that @ I command thee this day: @%, I drive
out @	 thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and
the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in
the @a of thee: 34:13 But ye @ destroy @ @\s, break
@ images, and cut down @ groves: 34:14 For thou @ worship
no @C god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and
they go a whoring @ @ gods, and do sacrifice unto @ gods,
and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take
of @ daughters unto thy sons, and @ daughters go a whoring
@ @ gods, and make thy sons go a whoring @ @ gods.

34:17 Thou @ make thee no molten gods.

34:18 The feast of unleavened @d @ thou keep. Seven days thou

34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and @ @Oling @

34:20 But the @Oling of an ass thou @ redeem with a lamb: and

34:21 Six days thou @ work, but on the @Hth day thou @

34:22 And thou @ observe the feast of weeks, of the @Ofruits of

34:23 Thrice in the year @ all your men@ appear @	 the

34:24 For I will cast out the nations @	 thee, and enlarge thy

34:25 Thou @ not offer the @I of my sacrifice with leaven;

13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

13:42 And if @ be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white

13:43 Then the @6 @ look upon it: and, @%, if the rising

13:56 And if the @6 look, and, @%, the plague be somewhat dark

15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed @ wash his clothes, and bathe

15:8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then

15:14 And on the eighth day he @ take to him two turtledoves, or

And the @6 @ offer them, the one for a sin @&, and the

15:16 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he

15:17 And @ garment, and @ skin, whereon is the seed of

15:18 The woman also with whom man @ lie with seed of copulation,

15:19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her @R be
@I, she @ be put apart @H days: and whosoever toucheth her
@ be unclean until the even.

15:20 And @ @7 that she lieth upon in her separation @ be

15:25 And if a woman have an issue of her @I many days out of the

15:26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue @ be

15:27 And whosoever toucheth @J @ @ be unclean, and @

15:28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she @ number to

15:29 And on the eighth day she @ take unto her two turtles, or

15:30 And the @6 @ offer the one for a sin @&, and the

15:31 Thus @ ye separate the @ of @ from @

15:32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
goeth from him, and is defiled @with; 15:33 And of her that is
sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of

16:1 And the LORD @0 unto @ @ the @^ of the two sons of

16:3 Thus @ Aaron come into the holy @': with a young bullock

16:4 He @ put on the holy linen coat, and he @ have the linen

16:7 And he @ take the two goats, and present them @	 the LORD

16:11 And Aaron @ @( the bullock of the sin @&, @ is

16:15 Then @ he kill the goat of the sin @&, that is for the

he did with the @I of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy

for the holy @', @ of the uncleanness of the @ of
@, and @ of @ transgressions in all @ sins: and so

16:17 And @ @ be no man in the tabernacle of the @`
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy @', until he come

16:18 And he @ go out unto the @\ that is @	 the LORD, and

16:19 And he @ sprinkle of the @I upon it with his finger @H

@ of @.

16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy @', and

live goat: 16:21 And Aaron @ lay both his @D upon the head of

a fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 And the goat @ bear upon him
all @ iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he @ let go
the goat in the wilderness.

16:23 And Aaron @ come into the tabernacle of the @`,
and @ put off the linen garments, @ he put on when he went
into the holy @', and @ leave them @: 16:24 And he @
wash his @R with @Z in the holy @', and put on his garments,

16:25 And the fat of the sin @& @ he burn upon the @\.

16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat @ wash his

16:27 And the bullock for the sin @&, and the goat for the sin

16:29 And this @ be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
@Hth month, on the tenth day of the month, ye @ afflict your

the @6 make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be
clean from all your sins @	 the LORD.

16:31 It @ be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye @ afflict

16:32 And the @6, whom he @ anoint, and whom he @

And he did as the LORD @M @.

17:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 17:2 Speak unto Aaron, and

This is the @7 @ the LORD hath @M, @, 17:3 What man

17:6 And the @6 @ sprinkle the @I upon the @\ of the

17:7 And they @ no more offer @ sacrifices unto devils, @

17:11 For the life of the @R is in the @I: and I have @= it

the @I that maketh an atonement for the soul.

17:12 @N I said unto the @ of @, No soul of you

18:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 18:2 Speak unto the

18:19 Also thou @ not approach unto a woman to uncover her

26:5 And your threshing @ reach unto the vintage, and the vintage

26:7 And ye @ chase your enemies, and they @ fall @	 you

26:8 And five of you @ chase an @/, and an @/ of you

26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and

26:10 And ye @ eat old store, and @( @ the old @ of

26:11 And I set my tabernacle @ you: and my soul @ not abhor

26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all @

26:17 And I will set my face @

26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will

26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your

26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I

26:22 I will also send wild beasts @ you, @ @ rob you of

26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by @ @, but will

26:25 And I will @( a @Q upon you, that @ avenge the quarrel

26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk

26:29 And ye @ eat the @R of your sons, and the @R of your

26:30 And I will destroy your high @'s, and cut down your images,

26:31 And I will make your @G waste, and @( your sanctuaries

26:32 And I will @( the land into desolation: and your enemies

26:34 Then @ the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth

26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it @ rest; @ it did not

26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness

26:38 And ye @ perish @ the heathen, and the land of your

26:39 And they that are left of you @ pine away in @ iniquity

26:40 If they @ confess @ iniquity, and the iniquity of @

that also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also

26:43 The land also @ be left of them, and @ enjoy her

26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of @ enemies,
I will not cast them away, @" will I abhor them, to destroy them

26:45 But I will for @ sakes remember the covenant of @

26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, @ the LORD
made between him and the @ of @ in mount Sinai by the hand
of @.

27:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 27:2 Speak unto the
@ of @, and say unto them, When a man @ make a
singular vow, the persons @ be for the LORD by thy estimation.

27:3 And thy estimation @ be of the male from twenty @8 old
even unto sixty @8 old, even thy estimation @ be fifty shekels
of silver, @ the shekel of the sanctuary.

27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation @ be thirty
shekels.

27:5 And if it be from five @8 old even unto twenty @8 old, then
thy estimation @ be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female
ten shekels.

27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five @8 old, then thy
estimation @ be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
female thy estimation @ be @@ shekels of silver.

27:7 And if it be from sixty @8 old and above; if it be a male,
then thy estimation @ be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
shekels.

27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he @ present
@9 @	 the @6, and the @6 @ value him; @$
to his ability that vowed @ the @6 value him.

27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men @( an @& unto the
LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD @ be holy.

27:10 He @ not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
for a good: and if he @ at all change beast for beast, then it and
the exchange @of @ be holy.

27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of @ they do not offer a
sacrifice unto the LORD, then he @ present the beast @	 the
@6: 27:12 And the @6 @ value it, whether it be good or
bad: as thou valuest it, who art the @6, so @ it be.

27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he @ add a fifth part
@of unto thy estimation.

27:14 And when a man @ sanctify his @ to be holy unto the
LORD, then the @6 @ estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as
the @6 @ estimate it, so @ it stand.

27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his @, then he
@ add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and
it @ be his.

27:16 And if a man @ sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
of his possession, then thy estimation @ be @$ to the seed
@of: an homer of barley seed @ be valued at fifty shekels of
silver.

27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, @$ to
thy estimation it @ stand.

27:18 But if he sanctify his field @ the jubile, then the @6
@ reckon unto him the money @$ to the @8 that remain,
even unto the year of the jubile, and it @ be abated from thy
estimation.

27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
then he @ add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
it, and it @ be assured to him.

27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
field to @F man, it @ not be redeemed any more.

27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, @ be holy
unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession @of @ be the
@6's.

27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field @ he hath
bought, @ is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the
@6 @ reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto
the year of the jubile: and he @ give @ estimation in that
day, as a holy @7 unto the LORD.

27:24 In the year of the jubile the field @ return unto him of
whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
belong.

27:25 And all thy estimations @ be @$ to the shekel of the
sanctuary: twenty gerahs @ be the shekel.

27:26 Only the @Oling of the beasts, @ @# be the LORD's
@Oling, no man @ sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is
the LORD's.

27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he @ redeem it
@$ to @ estimation, and @ add a fifth part of it
@to: or if it be not redeemed, then it @ be sold @$ to
thy estimation.

27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted @7, that a man @ devote unto
the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field
of his possession, @ be sold or redeemed: @ devoted @7 is
most holy unto the LORD.

27:29 None devoted, @ @ be devoted of men, @ be redeemed;
but @ surely be put to @^.

27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.

27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he @
add @to the fifth part @of.

27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
whatsoever passeth @[ the rod, the tenth @ be holy unto the
LORD.

27:33 He @ not search whether it be good or bad, @" @ he
change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change
@of @ be holy; it @ not be redeemed.

27:34 These are the commandments, @ the LORD @M @ for
the @ of @ in mount Sinai.

8:19 And I have @= the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons

8:23 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 8:24 This is it that

9:6 And @ were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a

back, that we may not offer an @& of the LORD in his appointed

Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning

9:9 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 9:10 Speak unto the

9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they @ keep

9:12 They @ leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone

9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even
@ was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
the morning.

9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
of fire by night.

9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then @

9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the @ of @ journeyed,

abode upon the tabernacle they rested in @ tents.

9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
then the @ of @ kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed
not.

9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
@$ to the commandment of the LORD they abode in @ tents,
and @$ to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
journeyed.

9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining @on, the @ of
@ abode in @ tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken
up, they journeyed.

9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at

the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of @.

10:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 10:2 Make thee two
trumpets of silver; of a whole piece @ thou make them: that thou

10:3 And when they @ blow with them, all the assembly @

10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, @

10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
@ go forward.

10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on
the south side @ take @ journey: they @ blow an alarm for
@ journeys.

10:7 But when the @` is to be ga@d @?, ye @
blow, but ye @ not sound an alarm.

10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the @6s, @ blow with the trumpets;
and they @ be to you for an ordinance for ever @Eout your

10:9 And if ye go to war in your land @
 the enemy that

@ be remembered @	 the LORD your God, and ye @ be saved

10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
in the beginnings of your months, ye @ blow with the trumpets over
your @_ @&s, and over the sacrifices of your @U @&s;
that they may be to you for a memorial @	 your God: I am the LORD
your God.

10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in
the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony.

10:12 And the @ of @ took @ journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

10:13 And they @O took @ journey @$ to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of @.

10:14 In the @O @' went the standard of the camp of the @

son of Amminadab.

10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Issachar was
Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Zebulun was
Eliab the son of Helon.

10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward @$ to
@ armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Simeon was
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Gad was
Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
@C did set up the tabernacle @
 they came.

10:22 And the standard of the camp of the @ of Ephraim set
forward @$ to @ armies: and over his host was Elishama the
son of Ammihud.

10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Manasseh was
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Benjamin was
Abidan the son of Gideoni.

10:25 And the standard of the camp of the @ of Dan set forward,
@ was the rereward of all the camps @Eout @ hosts: and
over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Asher was
Pagiel the son of Ocran.

10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the @ of Naphtali was
Ahira the son of Enan.

10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the @ of @ @$ to
@ armies, when they set forward.

10:29 And @ said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
@' @ in law, We are journeying unto the @' of @ the
LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee

10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
own land, and to my kindred.

10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to
us instead of eyes.

10:32 And it @ be, if thou go with us, yea, it @ be, that what
goodness the LORD @ do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD @@ days'
journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went @	 them in
the @@ days' journey, to search out a resting @' for them.

10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
out of the camp.

10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that @ said,
Rise up, LORD, and let @ enemies be scattered; and let them that
hate thee flee @	 thee.

10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
@:s of @.

11:1 And when the @ complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
LORD @) it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
@_ @ them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp.

11:2 And the @ cried unto @; and when @ prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.

11:3 And he @, the name of the @' Taberah: @ the fire of
the LORD @_ @ them.

11:4 And the mixt multitude that was @ them fell a lusting: and
the @ of @ also wept @*, and said, Who @ give us
@R to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, @ we did eat in @-
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: @ is no@7
at all, beside this manna, @	 our eyes.

11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour @of as
the colour of bdellium.

11:8 And the @ went @+, and ga@d it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.

11:10 Then @ @) the @ weep @Eout @ families,
@ man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled @ly; @ also was displeased.

11:11 And @ said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy

layest the burden of all this @ upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived
all this @? have I begotten them, that thou @#est say unto

Whence @# I have @R to give unto all this @? for they weep

11:14 I am not able to bear all this @ alone, @ it is too
heavy for me.

11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have @V favour in thy sight; and let me not see my

11:16 And the LORD said unto @, Gather unto me @Hty men of the
elders of @, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the @,
and officers over them; and @( them unto the tabernacle of the

11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee @: and I will take

@ bear the burden of the @ with thee, that thou bear it not

11:18 And say thou unto the @, Sanctify yourselves @

LORD, @, Who @ give us @R to eat? for it was well with us
in @-: @fore the LORD will give you @R, and ye @ eat.

11:19 Ye @ not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, @"
ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come
out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: @ that ye
have despised the LORD @ is @ you, and have wept @	 him,
@, Why came we @ out of @-?  11:21 And @ said, The
@, @ whom I am, are six @/ @: footmen; and thou
hast said, I will give them @R, that they may eat a whole month.

11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them?  or @ all the fish of the sea be ga@d @? for them,
to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto @, Is the LORD's
hand waxed short? thou @ see now whether my word @ come to

11:24 And @ went out, and told the @ the @5 of the LORD,
and ga@d the @Hty men of the elders of the @, and set them
round @+ the tabernacle.

11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and @0 unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the @Hty elders:
and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.

11:26 But @ remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
one was Eldad, and the name of the @C Medad: and the spirit rested
upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

11:27 And @ ran a young man, and told @, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.

11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the @< of @, one of his
young men, @> and said, My lord @, forbid them.

11:29 And @ said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? @L God
that all the LORD's @ were prophets, and that the LORD @L put
his spirit upon them!  11:30 And @ gat him into the camp, he and
the elders of @.

11:31 And @ went @ a wind from the LORD, and @ quails
from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's
journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the @C

face of the @.

11:32 And the @ stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they ga@d the quails: he that ga@d least
ga@d ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for @T
round @+ the camp.

11:33 And while the @R was yet between @ teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled @
 the @, and the
LORD smote the @ with a very @ plague.

11:34 And he @, the name of that @' Kibrothhattaavah: @
@ they buried the @ that lusted.

11:35 And the @ journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
and abode at Hazeroth.

12:1 And Miriam and Aaron @0 @
 @ @ of the Ethiopian
woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by @? hath he
not spoken also by us? And the LORD @) it.

12:3 (Now the man @ was very meek, above all the men @ were
upon the face of the @.)  12:4 And the LORD @0 suddenly unto
@, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye @@ unto the

12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in

came @.

12:6 And he said, Hear now my @5: If @ be a prophet @ you,
I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will @K

12:7 My @< @ is not so, who is faithful in all mine @.

12:8 With him will I @K @P to @P, even apparently, and not in

12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 them; and he
departed.

12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, @%,
Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
and, @%, she was leprous.

12:11 And Aaron said unto @, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we
have sinned.

12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the @R is half consumed
when he cometh out of his m@C's womb.

12:13 And @ cried unto the LORD, @, Heal her now, O God, I
beseech thee.

12:14 And the LORD said unto @, If her @ had but spit in her
face, @# she not be ashamed @H days? let her be shut out from
the camp @H days, and @ that let her be received in @*.

12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp @H days: and the @
journeyed not till Miriam was @ in @*.

12:16 And @ward the @ removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
the wilderness of Paran.

13:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 13:2 Send thou men, that
they may search the land of Canaan, @ I give unto the @ of
@: of @ tribe of @ @s @ ye send a man, @ one

13:3 And @ by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
wilderness of Paran: all @J men were heads of the @ of
@.

13:4 And @ were @ names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
son of Zaccur.

13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

13:6 Of the tribe of @, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi
the son of Susi.

13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

13:16 These are the names of the men @ @ sent to spy out the
land.

And @ @, Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

13:17 And @ sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the @ that dwelleth
@in, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what
the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what
@G they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong
holds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether
@ be wood @in, or not. And be ye of good courage, and @( of
the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the @Oripe
grapes.

13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the @ of Anak, were. (Now Hebron
was built @H @8 @	 Zoan in @-.)  13:23 And they came unto
the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they
@ of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

13:24 The @' was @, the brook Eshcol, @ of the cluster of
grapes @ the @ of @ cut down from thence.

13:25 And they returned from searching of the land @ forty days.

13:26 And they went and came to @, and to Aaron, and to all the
@` of the @ of @, unto the wilderness of Paran,
to Kadesh; and @ back word unto them, and unto all the
@`, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the
fruit of it.

13:28 Nevertheless the @ be strong that dwell in the land, and
the @G are walled, and very @: and moreover we saw the
@ of Anak @.

13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,
and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

13:30 And Caleb stilled the @ @	 @, and said, Let us go
up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
@
 the @; for they are stronger than we.

13:32 And they @ up an evil report of the land @ they had
searched unto the @ of @, @, The land, @E @
we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
@of; and all the @ that we saw in it are men of a @
stature.

13:33 And @ we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, @ come of the
giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were
in @ sight.

14:1 And all the @` lifted up @ @;, and cried; and
the @ wept that night.

14:2 And all the @ of @ murmured @
 @ and @

Aaron: and the whole @` said unto them, Would God that we
had died in the land of @-! or @L God we had died in this
wilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD @ us unto this
land, to fall by the @Q, that our wives and our @ @# be
a prey? were it not better for us to return into @-?  14:4 And they
said one to @F, Let us make a captain, and let us return into
@-.

14:5 Then @ and Aaron fell on @ faces @	 all the assembly
of the @` of the @ of @.

14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, @
were of them that searched the land, rent @ clothes: 14:7 And they
@0 unto all the company of the @ of @, @, The
land, @ we passed @E to search it, is an exceeding good land.

14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will @( us into this land,
and give it us; a land @ floweth with milk and honey.

14:9 Only rebel not ye @
 the LORD, @" fear ye the @ of
the land; for they are @d for us: @ defence is departed from
them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

14:10 But all the @` bade stone them with stones. And the
@Y of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the @`
@	 all the @ of @.

14:11 And the LORD said unto @, How long will this @ provoke
me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs
@ I have shewed @ them?  14:12 I will smite them with the
pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a @er
nation and @Bier than they.

14:13 And @ said unto the LORD, Then the @-ians @ hear it,
(for thou @est up this @ in thy @B from @ them;)
14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they
have @) that thou LORD art @ this @, that thou LORD art
seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that
thou goest @	 them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a
pillar of fire by night.

14:15 Now if thou @ kill all this @ as one man, then the
nations @ have @) the fame of thee will @K, @, 14:16
Because the LORD was not able to @( this @ into the land @

14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be @,
@$ as thou hast spoken, @, 14:18 The LORD is
longsuffering, and of @ mercy, forgiving iniquity and
transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the

generation.

14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this @ @$
unto the @ness of thy mercy, and as thou hast for@= this
@, from @- even until now.

14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned @$ to thy word: 14:21
But as truly as I live, all the @ @ be filled with the @Y
of the LORD.

14:22 Because all @J men @ have seen my @Y, and my miracles,
@ I did in @- and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now
@ ten times, and have not hearkened to my @;; 14:23 Surely they
@ not see the land @ I sware unto @ @s, @" @
any of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my @< Caleb,

possess it.

14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the
Red sea.

14:26 And the LORD @0 unto @ and unto Aaron, @, 14:27 How
long @ I bear with this evil @`, @ murmur @

me? I have @) the murmurings of the @ of @, @ they

14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, @

fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, @$
to your whole number, from twenty @8 old and upward @ have

14:30 Doubtless ye @ not come into the land, concerning @ I

Joshua the son of Nun.

14:31 But your little ones, @ ye said @# be a prey, them will

14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they @ fall in this
wilderness.

14:33 And your @ @ wander in the wilderness forty @8,
and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the

14:34 After the number of the days in @ ye searched the land, even
forty days, each day for a year, @ ye bear your iniquities, even
forty @8, and ye @ know my breach of promise.

14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
@`, that are ga@d @? @
 me: in this
wilderness they @ be consumed, and @ they @ die.

14:36 And the men, @ @ sent to search the land, who returned,
and made all the @` to murmur @
 him, by @(ing up a
slander upon the land, 14:37 Even @J men that did @( up the evil
report upon the land, died by the plague @	 the LORD.

14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, @
were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

14:39 And @ told @ @s unto all the @ of @:
and the @ mourned @ly.

14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, @, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the
@' @ the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.

14:41 And @ said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
of the LORD? but it @ not prosper.

14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not @ you; that ye be not smitten
@	 your enemies.

14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are @ @	 you, and
ye @ fall by the @Q: @ ye are turned away from the LORD,
@fore the LORD will not be with you.

14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, and @, departed not out of the
camp.

14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites @ dwelt in
that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

15:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 15:2 Speak unto the

15:17 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 15:18 Speak unto the

15:21 Of the @O of your dough ye @ give unto the LORD an heave

15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all @ commandments,
@ the LORD hath spoken unto @, 15:23 Even all that the LORD

15:28 And the @6 @ make an atonement for the soul that sinneth

15:29 Ye @ have one law for him that sinneth @E ignorance,

15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born

15:36 And all the @` @ him @S the camp, and

15:37 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 15:38 Speak unto the

16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,

sons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up @	 @, with
certain of the @ of @, two @/ and fifty princes of

16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And
put fire @in, and put incense in them @	 the LORD to morrow:
and it @ be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he @ be

16:8 And @ said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
16:9 Seemeth it but a small @7 unto you, that the God of @

thou hast not @ us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,

16:15 And @ was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not

I hurt one of them.

16:16 And @ said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company @

man his censer, and put incense in them, and @( ye @	 the LORD

16:18 And they took @ man his censer, and put fire in them, and

16:19 And Korah ga@d all the @` @

16:20 And the LORD @0 unto @ and unto Aaron, @, 16:21
Separate yourselves from @ this @`, that I may consume
them in a moment.

16:22 And they fell upon @ faces, and said, O God, the God of the

16:24 Speak unto the @`, @, Get you up from @+ the

16:25 And @ rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
elders of @ followed him.

16:26 And he @0 unto the @`, @, Depart, I pray you,

16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
on @ side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door
of @ tents, and @ wives, and @ sons, and @ little

16:28 And @ said, Hereby ye @ know that the LORD hath sent me

16:29 If @ men die the common @^ of all men, or if they be
visited @ the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent

16:30 But if the LORD make a new @7, and the @ open her @P,

16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of @King all @

16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the

16:34 And all @ that were round @+ them fled at the cry of

16:35 And @ came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
@/ and fifty men that offered incense.

16:36 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar

16:38 The censers of @ sinners @

16:39 And Eleazar the @6 took the brasen censers, wherewith they

16:41 But on the morrow all the @` of the @ of @

 @ and @
 Aaron, @, Ye have killed the

16:42 And it came to pass, when the @` was ga@d @

@ and @

16:43 And @ and Aaron came @	 the tabernacle of the

16:44 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 16:45 Get you up from

they fell upon @ faces.

16:46 And @ said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire @in
from off the @\, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the
@`, and make an atonement for them: for @ is wrath gone
out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

16:47 And Aaron took as @ @M, and ran into the @a of the

he put on incense, and made an atonement for the @.

16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was

16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen @: and
@H @/, beside them that died @+ the matter of Korah.

16:50 And Aaron returned unto @ unto the door of the tabernacle of

17:1 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 17:2 Speak unto the

17:6 And @ @0 unto the @ of @, and @ one of

17:7 And @ laid up the rods @	 the LORD in the tabernacle of

17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow @ went into the

17:9 And @ @ out all the rods from @	 the LORD unto all

17:10 And the LORD said unto @, Bring Aaron's rod @* @	 the

17:11 And @ did so: as the LORD @M him, so did he.

17:12 And the @ of @ @0 unto @, @, @., we

17:13 Whosoever cometh any @7 near unto the tabernacle of the LORD

18:2 And thy @3 also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy

18:4 And they @ be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the

18:5 And ye @ keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of

18:6 And I, @%, I have taken your @3 the Levites from @

18:19 All the heave @&s of the holy @, @ the @

thou @ give the @` and @ beasts @b.

20:9 And @ took the rod from @	 the LORD, as he @M him.

20:10 And @ and Aaron ga@d the @` @? @	
the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch
you @Z out of this rock?  20:11 And @ lifted up his hand, and
with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the @Z came out
abundantly, and the @` drank, and @ beasts also.

20:12 And the LORD @0 unto @ and Aaron, Because ye believed me
not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the @ of @, @fore
ye @ not @( this @` into the land @ I have @=
them.

20:13 This is the @Z of Meribah; @ the @ of @
strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

20:14 And @ sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
Thus @
 thy @X @, Thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us: 20:15 How our @s went down into @-, and we have
dwelt in @- a long time; and the @-ians vexed us, and our
@s: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he @) our @;,
and sent an angel, and hath @ us @ out of @-: and,
@%, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17
Let us pass, I pray thee, @E thy country: we will not pass
@E the fields, or @E the vineyards, @" will we @b of
the @Z of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not
turn to the @c hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy
borders.

20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou @ not pass by me, lest I come
out @
 thee with the @Q.

20:19 And the @ of @ said unto him, We will go by the high
way: and if I and my cattle @b of thy @Z, then I will pay for
it: I will only, @S doing any@7 else, go @E on my feet.

20:20 And he said, Thou @ not go @E. And Edom came out
@
 him with much @, and with a strong hand.

20:21 Thus Edom refused to give @ passage @E his border:
wherefore @ turned away from him.

20:22 And the @ of @, even the whole @`,
journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

20:23 And the LORD @0 unto @ and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
coast of the land of Edom, @, 20:24 Aaron @ be ga@d unto

20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and @( them up unto mount
Hor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
his son: and Aaron @ be ga@d unto his @, and @ die
@.

20:27 And @ did as the LORD @M: and they went up into mount
Hor in the sight of all the @`.

20:28 And @ stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
Eleazar his son; and Aaron died @ in the top of the mount: and
@ and Eleazar came down from the mount.

20:29 And when all the @` saw that Aaron was dead, they
mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the @ of @.

21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, @ dwelt in the south, @)
tell that @ came by the way of the spies; then he fought @

@, and took some of them prisoners.

21:2 And @ vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
indeed deliver this @ into my hand, then I will utterly destroy
@ @G.

21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the @; of @, and delivered up
the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and @ @G: and
he @, the name of the @' Hormah.

21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the @ was much
discouraged @ of the way.

21:5 And the @ @0 @
 God, and @
 @, Wherefore
have ye @ us up out of @- to die in the wilderness? for @
is no @d, @" is @ any @Z; and our soul loatheth this

21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents @ the @, and they bit
the @; and much @ of @ died.

21:7 @N the @ came to @, and said, We have sinned, for
we have spoken @
 the LORD, and @
 thee; pray unto the LORD,
that he take away the serpents from us. And @ prayed for the
@.

21:8 And the LORD said unto @, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole: and it @ come to pass, that @ one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, @ live.

21:9 And @ made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
serpent of brass, he lived.

21:10 And the @ of @ set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
wilderness @ is @	 Moab, toward the sunrising.

21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the @C side of
Arnon, @ is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
Amorites.

21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth
upon the border of Moab.

21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
LORD @0 unto @, Gather the @ @?, and I will give
them @Z.

21:17 Then @ sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the @ digged it,
by the direction of the lawgiver, with @ staves. And from the
wilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that
is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, @ looketh toward
Jeshimon.

21:21 And @ sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
@, 21:22 Let me pass @E thy land: we will not turn into the
fields, or into the vineyards; we will not @b of the @Zs of the
well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past
thy borders.

21:23 And Sihon @L not suffer @ to pass @E his border:
but Sihon ga@d all his @ @?, and went out @

@ into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought @

@.

21:24 And @ smote him with the edge of the @Q, and possessed
his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the @ of Ammon: for
the border of the @ of Ammon was strong.

21:25 And @ took all @ @G: and @ dwelt in all the
@G of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages @of.

21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
had fought @
 the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out
of his hand, even unto Arnon.

21:27 Wherefore they that @K in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For @ is a fire
gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed
Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high @'s of Arnon.

21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O @ of Chemosh: he hath
@= his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto
Sihon king of the Amorites.

21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, @ reacheth unto Medeba.

21:31 Thus @ dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

21:32 And @ sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
@of, and drove out the Amorites that were @.

21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
king of Bashan went out @
 them, he, and all his @, to the
battle at Edrei.

21:34 And the LORD said unto @, Fear him not: for I have delivered
him into thy hand, and all his @, and his land; and thou @ do
to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, @ dwelt at
Heshbon.

21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his @, until @
was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

22:1 And the @ of @ set forward, and pitched in the plains
of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that @ had done to the
Amorites.

22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the @, @ they were many:
and Moab was distressed @ of the @ of @.

22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now @ this company
lick up all that are round @+ us, as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field.

And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

22:5 He sent messengers @fore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor, @ is by the river of the land of the @ of his
@, to call him, @, @., @ is a @ come out from
@-: @%, they cover the face of the @, and they abide over
@
 me: 22:6 Come now @fore, I pray thee, curse me this
@; for they are too @By for me: peradventure I @ prevail,
that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for
I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest
is cursed.

22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
rewards of divination in @ hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
@0 unto him the @5 of Balak.

22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will @(
you word @*, as the LORD @ @K unto me: and the princes of
Moab abode with Balaam.

22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are @ with thee?
22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
hath sent unto me, @, 22:11 @., @ is a @ come out of
@-, @ covereth the face of the @: come now, curse me them;
peradventure I @ be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou @ not go with them; thou
@ not curse the @: for they are blessed.

22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave
to go with you.

22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

22:15 And Balak sent yet @* princes, more, and more honourable than
they.

22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus @
 Balak the
son of Zippor, Let no@7, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto
me: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very @ honour, and I will
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come @fore, I pray thee, curse
me this @.

22:18 And Balaam @> and said unto the @<s of Balak, If
Balak @L give me his @ full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

22:19 Now @fore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word @ I
@ say unto thee, that @ thou do.

22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
with the princes of Moab.

22:22 And God's anger was kindled @ he went: and the angel of
the LORD stood in the way for an adversary @
 him. Now he was
riding upon his ass, and his two @<s were with him.

22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
his @Q drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,
and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into
the way.

22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot @
 the wall: and he
smote her @*.

22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
@', where was no way to turn either to the @c hand or to the
left.

22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down @[
Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a
staff.

22:28 And the LORD opened the @P of the ass, and she said unto
Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me @
@@ times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast
mocked me: I @L @ were a @Q in mine hand, for now @L I
kill thee.

22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I @ ass, upon @
thou hast ridden ever since I was @ unto this day? was I ever wont
to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
the LORD standing in the way, and his @Q drawn in his hand: and he
bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten @ ass @ @@ times? @%, I went out to withstand
thee, @ thy way is perverse @	 me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,
and turned from me @ @@ times: unless she had turned from me,
surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
knew not that thou stoodest in the way @
 me: now @fore, if
it displease thee, I will get me back @*.

22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
only the word that I @ @K unto thee, that thou @ @K. So
Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

22:36 And when Balak @) that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
him unto a city of Moab, @ is in the border of Arnon, @ is in
the utmost coast.

22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed
to promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am
come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any @7? the word
that God putteth in my @P, that @ I @K.

22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
princes that were with him.

22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
@ him up into the high @'s of Baal, that thence he @B see
the utmost part of the @.

23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here @H @\s, and
prepare me here @H oxen and @H rams.

23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
on @ @\ a bullock and a ram.

23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy @_ @&, and I
will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he
sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high @'.

23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared @H
@\s, and I have offered upon @ @\ a bullock and a ram.

23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's @P, and said, Return unto
Balak, and thus thou @ @K.

23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his @_
sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
@ me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, @, Come,
curse me @], and come, defy @.

23:8 How @ I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how @ I defy,
whom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks I
see him, and from the hills I @% him: lo, the @ @ dwell

23:10 Who can count the dust of @], and the number of the fourth
part of @? Let me die the @^ of the @ceous, and let my last
end be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou
done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, @%, thou
hast blessed them al@?.

23:12 And he @> and said, Must I not take heed to @K that
@ the LORD hath put in my @P?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,
Come, I pray thee, with me unto @F @', from whence thou mayest
see them: thou @ see but the utmost part of them, and @ not
see them all: and curse me them from thence.

23:14 And he @ him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
Pisgah, and built @H @\s, and offered a bullock and a ram on
@ @\.

23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy @_ @&, while
I meet the LORD yonder.

23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his @P, and said,
Go @* unto Balak, and say thus.

23:17 And when he came to him, @%, he stood by his @_ @&,
and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath
the LORD spoken?  23:18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,
Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 23:19 God is not
a man, that he @# lie; @" the son of man, that he @#
repent: hath he said, and @ he not do it? or hath he spoken, and

23:21 He hath not beheld iniquity in @], @" hath he seen

23:22 God @ them out of @-; he hath as it were the strength

23:23 Surely @ is no enchantment @

23:25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
them at all.

23:26 But Balaam @> and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
@, All that the LORD @Keth, that I must do?  23:27 And Balak
said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will @( thee unto @F
@'; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them
from thence.

23:28 And Balak @ Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
toward Jeshimon.

23:29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here @H @\s, and
prepare me here @H bullocks and @H rams.

23:30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
ram on @ @\.

24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless @, he
went not, as at @C times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his
face toward the wilderness.

24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw @ abiding in his
tents @$ to @ tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:4 He hath said,
@ @) the @5 of God, @ saw the vision of the Al@By,
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 24:5 How goodly are

24:7 He @ pour the @Z out of his buckets, and his seed @ be

24:8 God @ him @ out of @-; he hath as it were the

24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a @ lion: who @
stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that
curseth thee.

24:10 And Balak's anger was kindled @
 Balaam, and he smote his

@@ times.

24:11 @N now flee thou to thy @': I thought to promote thee

24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers

24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor

said, @ @) the @5 of God, and knew the knowledge of the most
High, @ saw the vision of the Al@By, falling into a trance, but

24:19 Out of @] @ come he that @ have dominion, and @

24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
Amalek was the @O of the nations; but his latter end @ be that
he perish for ever.

24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
Strong is thy dwelling@', and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite @ be wasted, until Asshur @

24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who @ live when
God doeth this!  24:24 And ships @ come from the coast of Chittim,

24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his @': and
Balak also went his way.

25:1 And @ abode in Shittim, and the @ began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

25:2 And they @, the @ unto the sacrifices of @ gods: and
the @ did eat, and bowed down to @ gods.

25:3 And @ joined @9 unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the

 @.

25:4 And the LORD said unto @, Take all the heads of the @,

 the sun, that the fierce
anger of the LORD may be turned away from @.

25:5 And @ said unto the judges of @, Slay ye @ one his

25:6 And, @%, one of the @ of @ came and @ unto

35:3 And the @G @ they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of

35:4 And the suburbs of the @G, @ ye @ give unto the

35:5 And ye @ measure from @S the city on the east side two

35:6 And @ the @G @ ye @ give unto the Levites @
@ be six @G for refuge, @ ye @ appoint for the

35:7 So all the @G @ ye @ give to the Levites @ be

35:8 And the @G @ ye @ give @ be of the possession of

35:9 And the LORD @0 unto @, @, 35:10 Speak unto the

35:15 These six @G @ be a refuge, both for the @ of

35:16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,

35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,

36:1 And the chief @s of the families of the @ of Gilead,

36:10 Even as the LORD @M @, so did the daughters of

Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto @ @'s

36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, @ the LORD
@M by the hand of @ unto the @ of @ in the
plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.




The Fifth Book of @:  Called Deuteronomy


1:1 These be the @5 @ @ @0 unto all @ on this side
Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over @
 the Red sea,
between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

1:2 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth
year, in the eleventh month, on the @O day of the month, that @
@0 unto the @ of @, @$ unto all that the LORD
had @= him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihon
the king of the Amorites, @ dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of
Bashan, @ dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in
the land of Moab, began @ to declare this law, @, 1:6 The
LORD our God @0 unto us in Horeb, @, Ye have dwelt long enough
in this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the
mount of the Amorites, and unto all the @'s nigh @unto, in the
plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea
side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the @
river, the river Euphrates.

1:8 @., I have set the land @	 you: go in and possess the land
@ the LORD sware unto your @s, Abraham, Isaac, and @], to
give unto them and to @ seed @ them.

1:9 And I @0 unto you at that time, @, I am not able to bear
you myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,
@%, ye are this day as the stars of @1 for multitude.

1:11 (The LORD God of your @s make you a @: times so many
more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can
I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
1:13 Take you wise men, and @[standing, and known @ your
tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

1:14 And ye @> me, and said, The @7 @ thou hast spoken is
good for us to do.

1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
them heads over you, captains over @:s, and captains over
@/s, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
officers @ your tribes.

1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, @, Hear the causes
between your @3, and judge @ceously between @ man and his
@X, and the stranger that is with him.

1:17 Ye @ not respect persons in judgment; but ye @ hear the
small as well as the @; ye @ not be afraid of the face of man;
for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you,
@( it unto me, and I will hear it.

1:18 And I @M you at that time all the @ @ ye @#
do.

1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went @E all that @
and terrible wilderness, @ ye saw by the way of the mountain of
the Amorites, as the LORD our God @M us; and we came to
Kadeshbarnea.

1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
Amorites, @ the LORD our God doth give unto us.

1:21 @., the LORD thy God hath set the land @	 thee: go up and
possess it, as the LORD God of thy @s hath said unto thee; fear
not, @" be discouraged.

1:22 And ye came near unto me @ one of you, and said, We will send
men @	 us, and they @ search us out the land, and @( us
word @* by what way we must go up, and into what @G we @
come.

1:23 And the @ pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one
of a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and
came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in @ @D, and
@ it down unto us, and @ us word @*, and said, It is a
good land @ the LORD our God doth give us.

1:26 Notwithstanding ye @L not go up, but rebelled @
 the
commandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,
and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath @ us @ out of
the land of @-, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to
destroy us.

1:28 Whither @ we go up? our @3 have discouraged our @,
@, The @ is @er and taller than we; the @G are @
and walled up to @1; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims @.

1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, @" be afraid of them.

1:30 The LORD your God @ goeth @	 you, he @ fight for you,
@$ to all that he did for you in @- @	 your eyes; 1:31
And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God
bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
until ye came into this @'.

1:32 Yet in this @7 ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Who
went in the way @	 you, to search you out a @' to pitch your
tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye @# go, and
in a cloud by day.

1:34 And the LORD @) the @; of your @5, and was wroth, and
sware, @, 1:35 Surely @ @ not one of @ men of this
evil generation see that good land, @ I sware to give unto your
@s.

1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he @ see it, and to him will
I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his @,
@ he hath wholly followed the LORD.

1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, @, Thou also
@ not go in thither.

1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, @ standeth @	 thee, he @
go in thither: encourage him: for he @ cause @ to inherit it.

1:39 Moreover your little ones, @ ye said @# be a prey, and
your @, @ in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil, they @ go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they
@ possess it.

1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

1:41 Then ye @> and said unto me, We have sinned @
 the
LORD, we will go up and fight, @$ to all that the LORD our God
@M us.

And when ye had girded on @ man his weapons of war, ye were ready
to go up into the hill.

1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, @"
fight; for I am not @ you; lest ye be smitten @	 your enemies.

1:43 So I @0 unto you; and ye @L not hear, but rebelled @

the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

1:44 And the Amorites, @ dwelt in that mountain, came out @

you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
Hormah.

1:45 And ye returned and wept @	 the LORD; but the LORD @L not
hearken to your @;, nor give ear unto you.

1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, @$ unto the days that ye
abode @.

2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the LORD @0 unto me: and we compassed mount
Seir many days.

2:2 And the LORD @0 unto me, @, 2:3 Ye have compassed this
mountain long enough: turn you northward.

2:4 And command thou the @, @, Ye are to pass @E the
coast of your @3 the @ of Esau, @ dwell in Seir; and
they @ be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves
@fore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of @
land, no, not so much as a foot @dth; @ I have @= mount
Seir unto Esau for a possession.

2:6 Ye @ buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye @
also buy @Z of them for money, that ye may @b.

2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
hand: he knoweth thy walking @E this @ wilderness: @
forty @8 the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked
no@7.

2:8 And when we passed by from our @3 the @ of Esau,
@ dwelt in Seir, @E the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, @"
contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of @ land
for a possession; @ I have @= Ar unto the @ of Lot for
a possession.

2:10 The Emims dwelt @in in times past, a @ @, and many,
and tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as
the Anakims; but the Moabites @, them Emims.

2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir @	time; but the @ of
Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from @	 them,
and dwelt in @ stead; as @ did unto the land of his
possession, @ the LORD gave unto them.

2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
went over the brook Zered.

2:14 And the space in @ we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight @8; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from @ the host, as
the LORD sware unto them.

2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was @
 them, to destroy them
from @ the host, until they were consumed.

2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from @ the @, 2:17 That the LORD @0 unto me, @,
2:18 Thou art to pass over @E Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
2:19 And when thou comest nigh over @
 the @ of Ammon,
distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of
the land of the @ of Ammon any possession; @ I have @=
it unto the @ of Lot for a possession.

2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt @in
in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A @
@, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them
@	 them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in @ stead: 2:22
As he did to the @ of Esau, @ dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from @	 them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in @ stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims @
dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, @ came @
out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in @ stead.)  2:24 Rise
ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: @%, I
have @= into @ hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his
land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.

2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are @[ the whole @1, who @ hear
report of thee, and @ tremble, and be in anguish @ of thee.

2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with @5 of @U, @, 2:27 Let me pass
@E thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will @" turn
unto the @c hand nor to the left.

2:28 Thou @ sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
@Z for money, that I may @b: only I will pass @E on my
feet; 2:29 (As the @ of Esau @ dwell in Seir, and the
Moabites @ dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I @ pass over
Jordan into the land @ the LORD our God giveth us.

2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon @L not let us pass by him: for the
LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his @ obstinate, that
he @B deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

2:31 And the LORD said unto me, @., I have begun to give Sihon and
his land @	 thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his
land.

2:32 Then Sihon came out @
 us, he and all his @, to fight
at Jahaz.

2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him @	 us; and we smote him,
and his sons, and all his @.

2:34 And we took all his @G at that time, and utterly destroyed
the men, and the women, and the little ones, of @ city, we left
none to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto
ourselves, and the spoil of the @G @ we took.

2:36 From Aroer, @ is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, @ was not one
city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37
Only unto the land of the @ of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
any @' of the river Jabbok, nor unto the @G in the mountains,
nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
Bashan came out @
 us, he and all his @, to battle at Edrei.

3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,
and all his @, and his land, into thy hand; and thou @ do
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, @ dwelt at
Heshbon.

3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our @D Og also, the king of
Bashan, and all his @: and we smote him until none was left to
him remaining.

3:4 And we took all his @G at that time, @ was not a city
@ we took not from them, @@score @G, all the region of
Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

3:5 All @ @G were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
beside unwalled towns a @ many.

3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and @, of @
city.

3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the @G, we took for a
prey to ourselves.

3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of
Arnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;
and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the @G of the plain,
and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, @G of the
kingdom of Og in Bashan.

3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
@% his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of
the @ of Ammon? nine cubits was the length @of, and four
cubits the @dth of it, @ the cubit of a man.

3:12 And this land, @ we possessed at that time, from Aroer, @
is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the @G @of,
gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,
gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with
all Bashan, @ was @, the land of giants.

3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and @, them @ his own name,
Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto
the river Jabbok, @ is the border of the @ of Ammon; 3:17
The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast @of, from Chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, @[ Ashdothpisgah
eastward.

3:18 And I @M you at that time, @, The LORD your God hath
@= you this land to possess it: ye @ pass over armed @	
your @3 the @ of @, all that are meet for the war.

3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
know that ye have much cattle,) @ abide in your @G @ I

3:21 And I @M Joshua at that time, @, Thine eyes have seen

the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

3:22 Ye @ not fear them: for the LORD your God he @ fight for

3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, @, 3:24 O Lord GOD,
thou hast begun to shew thy @< thy @ness, and thy @By
hand: for what God is @ in @1 or in @, that can do
@$ to thy works, and @$ to thy @B?  3:25 I pray thee,
let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that
goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and @L not hear

3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up @ eyes

3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he

3:29 So we abode in the valley over @

4:1 Now @fore hearken, O @, unto the statutes and unto the

4:2 Ye @ not add unto the word @ I command you, @" @
ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the

4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did @ of Baalpeor: for all

from @ you.

4:4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive @ one

4:5 @., I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD

4:6 Keep @fore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your

@[standing @.

4:7 For what nation is @ so @, who hath God so nigh unto them,
as the LORD our God is in all @ that we call upon him for?  4:8
And what nation is @ so @, that hath statutes and judgments so
@ceous as all this law, @ I set @	 you this day?  4:9 Only
take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget
the @ @ @ eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy

4:11 And ye came near and stood @[ the mountain; and the mountain

4:12 And the LORD @0 unto you out of the @a of the fire: ye

4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, @ he @M you to

4:14 And the LORD @M me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments, that ye @B do them in the land whither ye go over to

4:15 Take ye @fore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of similitude on the day that the LORD @0 unto you in Horeb out of
the @a of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a
graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or
female, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the @, the
likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likeness
of any @7 that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish
that is in the @Zs beneath the @: 4:19 And lest thou lift up
@ eyes unto @1, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and

4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and @ you @ out of the

4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
that I @# not go over Jordan, and that I @# not go in unto

4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye

4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the

4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

4:25 When thou @ beget @, and @'s @, and ye

call @1 and @ to witness @
 you this day, that ye @

4:27 And the LORD @ scatter you @ the nations, and ye @ be

4:29 But if from thence thou @ seek the LORD thy God, thou @

4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, @ were @	 thee,

4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou @Best know that the LORD he

4:36 Out of @1 he made thee to hear his @;, that he @B

4:37 And @ he loved thy @s, @fore he chose @ seed

4:39 Know @fore this day, and consider it in @ @, that the

5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our @s, but with us,

5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the

5:11 Thou @ not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the

5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath

5:13 Six days thou @ labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But the

7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may

7:5 But thus @ ye deal with them; ye @ destroy @ @\s,

7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, @ ye

hath @ me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of
@ nations the LORD doth drive them out from @	 thee.

9:5 Not for thy @ceousness, or for the up@cness of @ @,
dost thou go to possess @ land: but for the wickedness of @
nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from @	 thee, and
that he may perform the word @ the LORD sware unto thy @s,
Abraham, Isaac, and @].

9:6 Understand @fore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this
good land to possess it for thy @ceousness; for thou art a
stiffnecked @.

9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to
wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of @-, until ye came unto this @', ye have been
rebellious @
 the LORD.

9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was
angry with you to have destroyed you.

9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,
even the tables of the covenant @ the LORD made with you, then I
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I @" did eat
@d nor @b @Z: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables
of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written
@$ to all the @5, @ the LORD @0 with you in the mount
out of the @a of the fire in the day of the assembly.

9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the
covenant.

9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
hence; for thy @ @ thou hast @ @ out of @- have
corrupted @T; they are quickly turned aside out of the way
@ I @M them; they have made them a molten image.

9:13 Furthermore the LORD @0 unto me, @, I have seen this
@, and, @%, it is a stiffnecked @: 9:14 Let me alone,
that I may destroy them, and blot out @ name from @[ @1:
and I will make of thee a nation @Bier and @er than they.

9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two @D.

9:16 And I looked, and, @%, ye had sinned @
 the LORD your
God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out
of the way @ the LORD had @M you.

9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two @D, and
brake them @	 your eyes.

9:18 And I fell down @	 the LORD, as at the @O, forty days and
forty nights: I did @" eat @d, nor @b @Z, @ of all
your sins @ ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,
to provoke him to anger.

9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
LORD was wroth @
 you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto
me at that time also.

9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and
I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

9:21 And I took your sin, the calf @ ye had made, and @_ it
with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was
as small as dust: and I cast the dust @of into the brook that
descended out of the mount.

9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
provoked the LORD to wrath.

9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, @, Go up
and possess the land @ I have @= you; then ye rebelled @

the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor
hearkened to his @;.

9:24 Ye have been rebellious @
 the LORD from the day that I knew
you.

9:25 Thus I fell down @	 the LORD forty days and forty nights, as
I fell down at the @O; @ the LORD had said he @L destroy
you.

9:26 I prayed @fore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy
not thy @ and @ inheritance, @ thou hast redeemed @E
thy @ness, @ thou hast @ @ out of @- with a
@By hand.

9:27 Remember thy @<s, Abraham, Isaac, and @]; look not unto
the stubbornness of this @, nor to @ wickedness, nor to @
sin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou @est us out say, Because the
LORD was not able to @( them into the land @ he promised them,
and @ he hated them, he hath @ them out to slay them in
the wilderness.

9:29 Yet they are thy @ and @ inheritance, @ thou
@est out by thy @By power and by thy stretched out arm.

10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone
like unto the @O, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee
an ark of wood.

10:2 And I will write on the tables the @5 that were in the @O
tables @ thou brakest, and thou @ put them in the ark.

10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone
like unto the @O, and went up into the mount, having the two tables
in mine hand.

10:4 And he wrote on the tables, @$ to the @O writing, the
ten commandments, @ the LORD @0 unto you in the mount out of
the @a of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave
them unto me.

10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
tables in the ark @ I had made; and @ they be, as the LORD
@M me.

10:6 And the @ of @ took @ journey from Beeroth of the
@ of Jaakan to Mosera: @ Aaron died, and @ he was
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the @6's office in his
stead.

10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
Jotbath, a land of rivers of @Zs.

10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand @	 the LORD to minister
unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his @3;
the LORD is his inheritance, @$ as the LORD thy God promised
him.

10:10 And I stayed in the mount, @$ to the @O time, forty
days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time
also, and the LORD @L not destroy thee.

10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey @	 the
@, that they may go in and possess the land, @ I sware unto
@ @s to give unto them.

10:12 And now, @, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but
to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy @ and with all thy
soul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,
@ I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 @., the @1
and the @1 of @1s is the LORD's thy God, the @ also, with
all that @in is.

10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy @s to love them, and he
chose @ seed @ them, even you above all @, as it is this
day.

10:16 Circumcise @fore the foreskin of your @, and be no more
stiffnecked.

10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a @
God, a @By, and a terrible, @ regardeth not persons, nor taketh
reward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the @less and
widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

10:19 Love ye @fore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
land of @-.

10:20 Thou @ fear the LORD thy God; him @ thou serve, and to
him @ thou cleave, and swear by his name.

10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
@ @ and terrible @, @ @ eyes have seen.

10:22 Thy @s went down into @- with @@score and ten

@1 for multitude.

11:1 @N thou @ love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

11:2 And know ye this day: for I @K not with your @ @
have not known, and @ have not seen the chastisement of the LORD
your God, his @ness, his @By hand, and his stretched out arm,
11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, @ he did in the @a of
@- unto Pharaoh the king of @-, and unto all his land; 11:4 And
what he did unto the army of @-, unto @ horses, and to @
chariots; how he made the @Z of the Red sea to overflow them as
they pursued @ you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this
day; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came
into this @'; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons
of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the @ opened her @P, and
swallowed them up, and @ @holds, and @ tents, and all the
substance that was in @ possession, in the @a of all @:
11:7 But your eyes have seen all the @ acts of the LORD @ he
did.

11:8 @N @ ye keep all the commandments @ I command you
this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,
whither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in
the land, @ the LORD sware unto your @s to give unto them and
to @ seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
land of @-, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
and @Zedst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But the
land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and
@beth @Z of the rain of @1: 11:12 A land @ the LORD thy
God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from
the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

11:13 And it @ come to pass, if ye @ hearken diligently unto
my commandments @ I command you this day, to love the LORD your
God, and to serve him with all your @ and with all your soul,
11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
the @O rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy
corn, and thy wine, and @ oil.

11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
mayest eat and be full.

11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your @ be not deceived, and ye
turn aside, and serve @C gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then the
LORD's wrath be kindled @
 you, and he shut up the @1, that
@ be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye
perish quickly from off the good land @ the LORD giveth you.

11:18 @N @ ye lay up @ my @5 in your @ and in
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be
as frontlets between your eyes.

11:19 And ye @ teach them your @, @King of them when
thou sittest in @ @, and when thou walkest by the way, when
thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

11:20 And thou @ write them upon the door posts of @ @,

days of your @, in the land @ the LORD sware unto your

11:22 For if ye @ diligently keep all @ commandments @ I
command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his
ways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all
@ nations from @	 you, and ye @ possess @er nations
and @Bier than yourselves.

11:24 Every @' whereon the soles of your feet @ tread @ be

Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea @ your coast be.

11:25 There @ no man be able to stand @	 you: for the LORD

11:26 @., I set @	 you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27
A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, @ I

commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way @
I command you this day, to go @ @C gods, @ ye have not

11:29 And it @ come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath @

@ put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount
Ebal.

11:30 Are they not on the @C side Jordan, by the way where the sun
goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, @ dwell in the

 Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  11:31 For

11:32 And ye @ observe to do all the statutes and judgments @

12:1 These are the statutes and judgments, @ ye @ observe to

12:2 Ye @ utterly destroy all the @'s, wherein the nations

12:4 Ye @ not do so unto the LORD your God.

12:5 But unto the @' @ the LORD your God @ choose out of

12:8 Ye @ not do @ all the @ that we do here this day,

12:9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,

12:10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land @ the LORD

12:13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy @_ @&s in

12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or

28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the @5 of this law that

29:1 These are the @5 of the covenant, @ the LORD @M

29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of @

30:4 If any of @ be driven out unto the outmost parts of @1,

30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise @ @, and the @

30:12 It is not in @1, that thou @#est say, Who @ go up

31:14 And the LORD said unto @, @., thy days approach that

your @D.

31:30 And @ @0 in the ears of all the @` of @
the @5 of this song, until they were ended.

32:1 Give ear, O ye @1s, and I will @K; and hear, O @, the
@5 of my @P.

32:2 My doctrine @ drop as the rain, my speech @ distil as the
dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
the grass: 32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe
ye @ness unto our God.

32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
judgment: a God of truth and @S iniquity, just and @c is he.

32:5 They have corrupted @T, @ spot is not the spot of his
@: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish @ and unwise? is not
he thy @ that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
established thee?  32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the @8
of many generations: ask thy @, and he will shew thee; thy
elders, and they will tell thee.

32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations @ inheritance, when
he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the @
@$ to the number of the @ of @.

32:9 For the LORD's portion is his @; @] is the lot of his
inheritance.

32:10 He @V him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
wilderness; he led him @+, he instructed him, he kept him as the
apple of his eye.

32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:
32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and @ was no strange god
with him.

32:13 He made him ride on the high @'s of the @, that he @B
eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of
the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 32:14 Butter of kine, and
milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and
goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst @b the pure
@I of the grape.

32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God @
made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
abominations provoked they him to anger.

32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your @s feared not.

32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
forgotten God that formed thee.

32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, @ of the
provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
@ end @ be: for they are a very froward generation, @
in whom is no faith.

32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that @ is not God; they
have provoked me to anger with @ vanities: and I will move them to
jealousy with @J @ are not a @; I will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation.

32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and @ burn unto the
lowest hell, and @ consume the @ with her increase, and set on
fire the @Vations of the mountains.

32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
them.

32:24 They @ be @_ with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

32:25 The @Q @S, and terror within, @ destroy both the
young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs.

32:26 I said, I @L scatter them into corners, I @L make the
remembrance of them to cease from @ men: 32:27 Were it not that I
feared the wrath of the enemy, lest @ adversaries @# behave
@T strangely, and lest they @# say, Our hand is high, and
the LORD hath not done all this.

32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, @" is @ any
@[standing in them.

32:29 O that they were wise, that they @[stood this, that they
@L consider @ latter end!  32:30 How @# one chase a
@:, and two put ten @: to flight, except @ Rock had
sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  32:31 For @ rock is not
as our Rock, even our enemies @T being judges.

32:32 For @ vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
Gomorrah: @ grapes are grapes of gall, @ clusters are bitter:
32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
asps.

32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up @ my
treasures?  32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; @ foot
@ slide in due time: for the day of @ calamity is at hand, and
the @ that @ come upon them make haste.

32:36 For the LORD @ judge his @, and repent @9 for his
@<s, when he seeth that @ power is gone, and @ is none
shut up, or left.

32:37 And he @ say, Where are @ gods, @ rock in whom they
trusted, 32:38 Which did eat the fat of @ sacrifices, and drank
the wine of @ @b @&s? let them rise up and help you, and
be your protection.

32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and @ is no god with me: I
kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: @" is @ any that
can deliver out of my hand.

32:40 For I lift up my hand to @1, and say, I live for ever.

32:41 If I whet my glittering @Q, and mine hand take hold on
judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
them that hate me.

32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with @I, and my @Q @
devour @R; and that with the @I of the slain and of the
captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his @: for he will avenge the
@I of his @<s, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
and will be merciful unto his land, and to his @.

32:44 And @ came and @0 all the @5 of this song in the ears
of the @, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

32:45 And @ made an end of @King all @ @5 to all @:
32:46 And he said unto them, Set your @s unto all the @5 @
I testify @ you this day, @ ye @ command your @ to
observe to do, all the @5 of this law.

32:47 For it is not a vain @7 for you; @ it is your life: and
@E this @7 ye @ prolong your days in the land, whither ye
go over Jordan to possess it.

32:48 And the LORD @0 unto @ that selfsame day, @, 32:49
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, @ is in
the land of Moab, that is over @
 Jericho; and @% the land of
Canaan, @ I give unto the @ of @ for a possession:
32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be ga@d unto
thy @; as Aaron thy @X died in mount Hor, and was ga@d
unto his @: 32:51 Because ye trespassed @
 me @ the
@ of @ at the @Zs of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness
of Zin; @ ye sanctified me not in the @a of the @ of
@.

32:52 Yet thou @ see the land @	 thee; but thou @ not go
thither unto the land @ I give the @ of @.

33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith @ the man of God blessed
the @ of @ @	 his @^.

33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
them; he shined @ from mount Paran, and he came with ten @:s
of saints: from his @c hand went a fiery law for them.

33:3 Yea, he loved the @; all his saints are in thy hand: and
they sat down at thy feet; @ one @ receive of thy @5.

33:4 @ @M us a law, even the inheritance of the

33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the @ and the
tribes of @ were ga@d @?.

33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

33:7 And this is the blessing of @: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
@; of @, and @( him unto his @: let his @D be
sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.

33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst
strive at the @Zs of Meribah; 33:9 Who said unto his @ and to
his m@C, I have not seen him; @" did he acknowledge his
@3, nor knew his own @: for they have observed thy word,
and kept thy covenant.

33:10 They @ teach @] thy judgments, and @ thy law: they
@ put incense @	 thee, and whole @_ sacrifice upon @
@\.

33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his @D;
smite @E the loins of them that rise @
 him, and of them
that hate him, that they rise not @*.

33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD @ dwell in
safety by him; and the Lord @ cover him all the day long, and he
@ dwell between his @#ers.

33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
precious @ of @1, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
beneath, 33:14 And for the precious fruits @ @ by the sun,
and for the precious @ put @ by the moon, 33:15 And for the
chief @ of the ancient mountains, and for the precious @ of
the lasting hills, 33:16 And for the precious @ of the @ and
fulness @of, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:
let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
head of him that was separated from his @3.

33:17 His @Y is like the @Oling of his bullock, and his horns
are like the horns of unicorns: with them he @ push the @
@? to the ends of the @: and they are the ten @:s of
Ephraim, and they are the @:s of Manasseh.

33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
Issachar, in thy tents.

33:19 They @ call the @ unto the mountain; @ they @
offer sacrifices of @ceousness: for they @ suck of the
abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

33:21 And he provided the @O part for @9, @ @, in a
portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of
the @, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments
with @.

33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he @ leap from
Bashan.

33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and
full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the
south.

33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with @; let
him be acceptable to his @3, and let him dip his foot in oil.

33:25 Thy shoes @ be iron and brass; and as thy days, so @ thy
strength be.

33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
@1 in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and @[neath are the
everlasting arms: and he @ thrust out the enemy from @	 thee;
and @ say, Destroy them.

33:28 @ then @ dwell in safety alone: the fountain of @]

33:29 Happy art thou, O @: who is like unto thee, O @ saved

34:1 And @ went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over @
 Jericho. And the LORD
shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 34:2 And all Naphtali,
and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of @, unto
the utmost sea, 34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of
Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land @ I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto @], @, I will give it unto thy

34:5 So @ the @< of the LORD died @ in the land of Moab,
@$ to the word of the LORD.

34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over @

Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

34:7 And @ was an @/ and twenty @8 old when he died: his
eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

34:8 And the @ of @ wept for @ in the plains of Moab
thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for @ were ended.

34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
@ had laid his @D upon him: and the @ of @
hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD @M @.

34:10 And @ arose not a prophet since in @ like unto @,
whom the LORD knew face to face, 34:11 In all the signs and the

The Book of Joshua


1:1 Now @ the @^ of @ the @< of the LORD it came to

1:3 Every @' that the sole of your foot @ tread upon, that have

1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the @ river,

1:5 There @ not any man be able to stand @	 thee all the days

fail thee, nor forsake thee.

1:6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this @ @ thou

to give them.

1:7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
to do @$ to all the law, @ @ my @< @M thee:

1:8 This book of the law @ not depart out of thy @P; but thou

1:9 Have not I @M thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not

1:10 Then Joshua @M the officers of the @, @, 1:11
Pass @E the host, and command the @, @, Prepare you

1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe

1:16 And they @> Joshua, @, All that thou commandest us we

1:17 According as we hearkened unto @ in all @, so will we

1:18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel @

2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
secretly, @, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and
came into an harlot's @, named Rahab, and lodged @.

2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, @, @., @ came

2:3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, @, Bring @ the

they be come to search out all the country.

2:4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 2:5 And it came to
pass @+ the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that
the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue @ them
quickly; for ye @ overtake them.

2:6 But she had @ them up to the roof of the @, and hid them
with the stalks of flax, @ she had laid in order upon the roof.

2:7 And the men pursued @ them the way to Jordan unto the fords:
and as soon as they @ pursued @ them were gone out, they shut
the gate.

2:8 And @	 they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
roof; 2:9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath @=

inhabitants of the land faint @ of you.

2:10 For we have @) how the LORD dried up the @Z of the Red sea

whom ye utterly destroyed.

2:11 And as soon as we had @) @ @, our @s did melt,
@" did @ remain any more courage in any man, @ of you:

2:12 Now @fore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my

2:14 And the men @> her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not

2:15 Then she let them down by a cord @E the window: for her
@ was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves @ @@ days, until the

2:17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this @

2:19 And it @ be, that whosoever @ go out of the doors of thy

2:20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
@ oath @ thou hast made us to swear.

2:21 And she said, According unto your @5, so be it. And she sent
them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the
window.

2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode @ @@
days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them
@Eout all the way, but @V them not.

2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all
@ that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the
LORD hath delivered into our @D all the land; for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint @ of us.

3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the @ of @, and

3:2 And it came to pass @ @@ days, that the officers went

3:4 Yet @ @ be a space between you and it, @+ two @:

3:5 And Joshua said unto the @, Sanctify yourselves: for to

3:6 And Joshua @0 unto the @6s, @, Take up the ark of the
covenant, and pass over @	 the @. And they took up the ark of
the covenant, and went @	 the @.

3:7 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify
thee in the sight of all @, that they may know that, as I was

3:8 And thou @ command the @6s that bear the ark of the

3:9 And Joshua said unto the @ of @, Come hither, and hear
the @5 of the LORD your God.

3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye @ know that the living God is
@ you, and that he will @S fail drive out from @	 you the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and
the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

3:11 @., the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the @

3:12 Now @fore take you twelve men out of the tribes of @,

3:14 And it came to pass, when the @ removed from @ tents, to

stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is
beside Zaretan: and @J that came down toward the sea of the plain,

 Jericho.

3:17 And the @6s that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
stood firm on dry ground in the @a of Jordan, and all the
@ites passed over on dry ground, until all the @ were passed
clean over Jordan.

4:1 And it came to pass, when all the @ were clean passed over

That this may be a sign @ you, that when your @ ask @
@s in time to come, @, What mean ye by @ stones?  4:7
Then ye @ answer them, That the @Zs of Jordan were cut off
@	 the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over
Jordan, the @Zs of Jordan were cut off: and @ stones @ be
for a memorial unto the @ of @ for ever.

4:8 And the @ of @ did so as Joshua @M, and took up
twelve stones out of the @a of Jordan, as the LORD @0 unto
Joshua, @$ to the number of the tribes of the @ of
@, and carried them over with them unto the @' where they
lodged, and laid them down @.

4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the @a of Jordan, in the
@' where the feet of the @6s @ bare the ark of the covenant
stood: and they are @ unto this day.

4:10 For the @6s @ bare the ark stood in the @a of Jordan,
until @@7 was finished that the LORD @M Joshua to @K
unto the @, @$ to all that @ @M Joshua: and the
@ hasted and passed over.

4:11 And it came to pass, when all the @ were clean passed over,
that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the @6s, in the presence
of the @.

4:12 And the @ of Reuben, and the @ of Gad, and half the
tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed @	 the @ of @, as
@ @0 unto them: 4:13 About forty @: prepared for war
passed over @	 the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all @;
and they feared him, as they feared @, all the days of his life.

4:15 And the LORD @0 unto Joshua, @, 4:16 Command the @6s
that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.

4:17 Joshua @fore @M the @6s, @, Come ye up out of
Jordan.

4:18 And it came to pass, when the @6s that bare the ark of the
covenant of the LORD were come up out of the @a of Jordan, and the
soles of the @6s' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the
@Zs of Jordan returned unto @ @', and flowed over all his
banks, as they did @	.

4:19 And the @ came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
@O month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

4:20 And @J twelve stones, @ they took out of Jordan, did
Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

4:21 And he @0 unto the @ of @, @, When your
@ @ ask @ @s in time to come, @, What mean
@ stones?  4:22 Then ye @ let your @ know, @,
@ came over this Jordan on dry land.

4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the @Zs of Jordan from @	
you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red
sea, @ he dried up from @	 us, until we were gone over: 4:24
That all the @ of the @ @B know the hand of the LORD, that
it is @By: that ye @B fear the LORD your God for ever.

5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, @
were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
Canaanites, @ were by the sea, @) that the LORD had dried up
the @Zs of Jordan from @	 the @ of @, until we were
passed over, that @ @ melted, @" was @ spirit in them
any more, @ of the @ of @.

5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
and circumcise @* the @ of @ the second time.

5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the @ of
@ at the hill of the foreskins.

5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the @
that came out of @-, that were males, even all the men of war, died
in the wilderness by the way, @ they came out of @-.

5:5 Now all the @ that came out were circumcised: but all the
@ that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came @
out of @-, them they had not circumcised.

5:6 For the @ of @ walked forty @8 in the wilderness,
till all the @ that were men of war, @ came out of @-,
were consumed, @ they obeyed not the @; of the LORD: unto
whom the LORD sware that he @L not shew them the land, @ the
LORD sware unto @ @s that he @L give us, a land that
floweth with milk and honey.

5:7 And @ @, whom he raised up in @ stead, them Joshua
circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, @ they had not
circumcised them by the way.

5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
@, that they abode in @ @'s in the camp, till they were
whole.

5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
reproach of @- from off you. Wherefore the name of the @' is
@, Gilgal unto this day.

5:10 And the @ of @ encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of
Jericho.

5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow @
the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.

5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow @ they had eaten of the
old corn of the land; @" had the @ of @ manna any
more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, @%, @ stood a man over @

him with his @Q drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and
said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  5:14 And he
said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And
Joshua fell on his face to the @, and did worship, and said unto
him, What @
 my Lord unto his @<?  5:15 And the captain of the
LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for
the @' whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.

6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up @ of the @ of
@: none went out, and none came in.

6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have @= into @ hand
Jericho, and the king @of, and the @By men of valour.

6:3 And ye @ compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
@+ the city once. Thus @ thou do six days.

6:4 And @H @6s @ bear @	 the ark @H trumpets of
rams' horns: and the @Hth day ye @ compass the city @H
times, and the @6s @ blow with the trumpets.

6:5 And it @ come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the
@ @ shout with a @ shout; and the wall of the city @
fall down flat, and the @ @ ascend up @ man straight
@	 him.

6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun @, the @6s, and said unto them,
Take up the ark of the covenant, and let @H @6s bear @H
trumpets of rams' horns @	 the ark of the LORD.

6:7 And he said unto the @, Pass on, and compass the city, and
let him that is armed pass on @	 the ark of the LORD.

6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the @, that
the @H @6s bearing the @H trumpets of rams' horns passed on
@	 the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the
covenant of the LORD followed them.

6:9 And the armed men went @	 the @6s that blew with the
trumpets, and the rereward came @ the ark, the @6s going on,
and blowing with the trumpets.

6:10 And Joshua had @M the @, @, Ye @ not shout,
nor make any noise with your @;, @" @ any word proceed out
of your @P, until the day I bid you shout; then @ ye shout.

6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going @+ it once:
and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the @6s took up the
ark of the LORD.

6:13 And @H @6s bearing @H trumpets of rams' horns @	
the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:
and the armed men went @	 them; but the rereward came @ the
ark of the LORD, the @6s going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp: so they did six days.

6:15 And it came to pass on the @Hth day, that they rose early
@+ the dawning of the day, and compassed the city @ the same
manner @H times: only on that day they compassed the city @H
times.

6:16 And it came to pass at the @Hth time, when the @6s blew
with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the @, Shout; for the LORD
hath @= you the city.

6:17 And the city @ be accursed, even it, and all that are
@in, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot @ live, she and all
that are with her in the @, @ she hid the messengers that we
sent.

6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed @7, lest
ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed @7, and
make the camp of @ a curse, and trouble it.

6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
consecrated unto the LORD: they @ come into the treasury of the
LORD.

6:20 So the @ shouted when the @6s blew with the trumpets:
and it came to pass, when the @ @) the sound of the trumpet,
and the @ shouted with a @ shout, that the wall fell down
flat, so that the @ went up into the city, @ man straight
@	 him, and they took the city.

6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
@Q.

6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country, Go into the harlot's @, and @( out thence the woman,
and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and @ out Rahab,
and her @, and her m@C, and her @3, and all that she
had; and they @ out all her kindred, and left them @S the
camp of @.

6:24 And they @_ the city with fire, and all that was @in: only
the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they
put into the treasury of the @ of the LORD.

6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her @'s
@hold, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in @ even unto
this day; @ she hid the messengers, @ Joshua sent to spy out
Jericho.

6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, @, Cursed be the man
@	 the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he
@ lay the @Vation @of in his @Oborn, and in his youngest
son @ he set up the gates of it.

6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised @Eout
all the country.

7:1 But the @ of @ committed a trespass in the accursed
@7: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of
Zerah, of the tribe of @, took of the accursed @7: and the
anger of the LORD was kindled @
 the @ of @.

7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, @ is beside Bethaven,
on the east of Bethel, and @0 unto them, @, Go up and view the
country.

And the men went up and viewed Ai.

7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
@ go up; but let @+ two or @@ @: men go up and smite
Ai; and make not all the @ to labour thither; for they are but
few.

7:4 So @ went up thither of the @ @+ @@ @: men:
and they fled @	 the men of Ai.

7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them @+ thirty and six men: for they
chased them from @	 the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in
the going down: wherefore the @s of the @ melted, and became
as @Z.

7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the @ upon his face
@	 the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of
@, and put dust upon @ heads.

7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
@ this @ over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the
Amorites, to destroy us? @L to God we had been content, and dwelt
on the @C side Jordan!  7:8 O LORD, what @ I say, when @
turneth @ backs @	 @ enemies!  7:9 For the Canaanites and
all the inhabitants of the land @ hear of it, and @ environ us
round, and cut off our name from the @: and what wilt thou do unto
thy @ name?  7:10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  7:11 @ hath sinned, and
they have also transgressed my covenant @ I @M them: for
they have even taken of the accursed @7, and have also stolen, and
dissembled also, and they have put it even @ @ own stuff.

7:12 @N the @ of @ could not stand @	 @
enemies, but turned @ backs @	 @ enemies, @ they
were accursed: @" will I be with you any more, except ye destroy
the accursed from @ you.

7:13 Up, sanctify the @, and say, Sanctify yourselves @
 to
morrow: for thus @
 the LORD God of @, There is an accursed
@7 in the @a of thee, O @: thou canst not stand @	
@ enemies, until ye take away the accursed @7 from @ you.

7:14 In the morning @fore ye @ be @ @$ to your
tribes: and it @ be, that the tribe @ the LORD taketh @
come @$ to the families @of; and the family @ the LORD
@ take @ come by @holds; and the @hold @ the LORD
@ take @ come man by man.

7:15 And it @ be, that he that is taken with the accursed @7
@ be @_ with fire, he and all that he hath: @ he hath
transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and @ he hath wrought
folly in @.

7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and @ @ by
@ tribes; and the tribe of @ was taken: 7:17 And he @
the family of @; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he
@ the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
7:18 And he @ his @hold man by man; and Achan, the son of
Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of @, was
taken.

7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, @Y to
the LORD God of @, and make confession unto him; and tell me now
what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

7:20 And Achan @> Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned @

the LORD God of @, and thus and thus have I done: 7:21 When I saw
@ the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two @/ shekels
of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted
them, and took them; and, @%, they are hid in the @ in the
@a of my tent, and the silver @[ it.

7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
@%, it was hid in his tent, and the silver @[ it.

7:23 And they took them out of the @a of the tent, and @ them
unto Joshua, and unto all the @ of @, and laid them out
@	 the LORD.

7:24 And Joshua, and all @ with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,
and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his
tent, and all that he had: and they @ them unto the valley of
Achor.

7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD @
trouble thee this day. And all @ stoned him with stones, and
burned them with fire, @ they had stoned them with stones.

7:26 And they raised over him a @ heap of stones unto this day. So
the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name
of that @' was @,, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, @" be thou dismayed:
take all the @ of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I
have @= into thy hand the king of Ai, and his @, and his city,
and his land: 8:2 And thou @ do to Ai and her king as thou didst
unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil @of, and the cattle
@of, @ ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush
for the city behind it.

8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the @ of war, to go up @
 Ai:
and Joshua chose out thirty @: @By men of valour, and sent
them away by night.

8:4 And he @M them, @, @., ye @ lie in wait
@
 the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city,
but be ye all ready: 8:5 And I, and all the @ that are with me,
will approach unto the city: and it @ come to pass, when they come
out @
 us, as at the @O, that we will flee @	 them, 8:6
(For they will come out @ us) till we have drawn them from the
city; for they will say, They flee @	 us, as at the @O:
@fore we will flee @	 them.

8:7 Then ye @ rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:
for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

8:8 And it @ be, when ye have taken the city, that ye @ set
the city on fire: @$ to the commandment of the LORD @ ye
do. See, I have @M you.

8:9 Joshua @fore sent them @: and they went to lie in ambush,
and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua
lodged that night @ the @.

8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the @,
and went up, he and the elders of @, @	 the @ to Ai.

8:11 And all the @, even the @ of war that were with him,
went up, and drew nigh, and came @	 the city, and pitched on the
north side of Ai: now @ was a valley between them and Ai.

8:12 And he took @+ five @: men, and set them to lie in
ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

8:13 And when they had set the @, even all the host that was on
the north of the city, and @ liers in wait on the west of the
city, Joshua went that night into the @a of the valley.

8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
and rose up early, and the men of the city went out @
 @ to
battle, he and all his @, at a time appointed, @	 the plain;
but he wist not that @ were liers in ambush @
 him behind the
city.

8:15 And Joshua and all @ made as if they were beaten @	
them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

8:16 And all the @ that were in Ai were @, @? to pursue
@ them: and they pursued @ Joshua, and were drawn away from
the city.

8:17 And @ was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
@ @: and they left the city open, and pursued @ @.

8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in
thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into @ hand. And Joshua
stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of @ @', and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,
and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.

8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, @%,
the smoke of the city ascended up to @1, and they had no power to
flee this way or that way: and the @ that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers.

8:21 And when Joshua and all @ saw that the ambush had taken the
city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned @*,
and slew the men of Ai.

8:22 And the @C issued out of the city @
 them; so they were
in the @a of @, some on this side, and some on that side: and
they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and @ him to Joshua.

8:24 And it came to pass, when @ had made an end of slaying all
the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they
chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the @Q,
until they were consumed, that all the @ites returned unto Ai,
and smote it with the edge of the @Q.

8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
women, were twelve @:, even all the men of Ai.

8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city @ took for a prey
unto @T, @$ unto the word of the LORD @ he
@M Joshua.

8:28 And Joshua @_ Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
desolation unto this day.

8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
soon as the sun was down, Joshua @M that they @# take his
carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of
the city, and raise @on a @ heap of stones, that remaineth
unto this day.

8:30 Then Joshua built an @\ unto the LORD God of @ in mount
Ebal, 8:31 As @ the @< of the LORD @M the @ of
@, as it is written in the book of the law of @, an @\ of
whole stones, over @ no man hath lift up any iron: and they
offered @on @_ @&s unto the LORD, and sacrificed @U
@&s.

8:32 And he wrote @ upon the stones a copy of the law of @,
@ he wrote in the presence of the @ of @.

8:33 And all @, and @ elders, and officers, and @ judges,
stood on this side the ark and on that side @	 the @6s the
Levites, @ bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the
stranger, as he that was born @ them; half of them over @

mount Gerizim, and half of them over @
 mount Ebal; as @ the

@ of @.

8:34 And @ward he read all the @5 of the law, the blessings and
cursings, @$ to all that is written in the book of the law.

8:35 There was not a word of all that @ @M, @ Joshua
read not @	 all the @` of @, with the women, and
the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant @ them.

9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings @ were on this side
Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the
@ sea over @
 Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the
Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, @) @of;
9:2 That they ga@d @T @?, to fight with Joshua and
with @, with one accord.

9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon @) what Joshua had done unto
Jericho and to Ai, 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon @ asses, and
wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 9:5 And old shoes and
clouted upon @ feet, and old garments upon them; and all the @d
of @ provision was dry and mouldy.

9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
him, and to the men of @, We be come from a far country: now
@fore make ye a league with us.

9:7 And the men of @ said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
@ us; and how @ we make a league with you?  9:8 And they said
unto Joshua, We are thy @<s. And Joshua said unto them, Who are
ye? and from whence come ye?  9:9 And they said unto him, From a very
far country thy @<s are come @ of the name of the LORD thy
God: for we have @) the fame of him, and all that he did in @-,
9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,
@ was at Ashtaroth.

9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country @0
to us, @, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet

9:12 This our @d we took hot for our provision out of our @s on
the day we came @ to go unto you; but now, @%, it is dry, and
it is mouldy: 9:13 And @ bottles of wine, @ we filled, were

are become old by reason of the very long journey.

9:14 And the men took of @ victuals, and asked not counsel at the
@P of the LORD.

9:15 And Joshua made @U with them, and made a league with them, to
let them live: and the princes of the @` sware unto them.

9:16 And it came to pass at the end of @@ days @ they had made

9:17 And the @ of @ journeyed, and came unto @ @G

Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

9:18 And the @ of @ smote them not, @ the princes of
the @` had sworn unto them by the LORD God of @. And
all the @` murmured @
 the princes.

9:19 But all the princes said unto all the @`, We have sworn
unto them by the LORD God of @: now @fore we may not touch
them.

9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
be upon us, @ of the oath @ we sware unto them.

9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of @Z unto all the @`; as the
princes had promised them.

9:22 And Joshua @, for them, and he @0 unto them, @,
Wherefore have ye beguiled us, @, We are very far from you; when
ye dwell @ us?  9:23 Now @fore ye are cursed, and @ @
none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and
drawers of @Z for the @ of my God.

9:24 And they @> Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
thy @<s, how that the LORD thy God @M his @< @ to
give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from @	 you, @fore we were sore afraid of our lives @ of
you, and have done this @7.

9:25 And now, @%, we are in @ hand: as it seemeth good and
@c unto thee to do unto us, do.

9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
the @ of @, that they slew them not.

9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of @Z
for the @`, and for the @\ of the LORD, even unto this
day, in the @' @ he @# choose.

10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of @  had @)
how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how
the inhabitants of Gibeon had made @U with @, and were @
them; 10:2 That they feared @ly, @ Gibeon was a @ city,
as one of the royal @G, and @ it was @er than Ai, and
all the men @of were @By.

10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of @ , sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of
Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, @, 10:4 Come up unto me,
and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made @U with
Joshua and with the @ of @.

10:5 @N the five kings of the Amorites, the king of @ ,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king
of Eglon, ga@d @T @?, and went up, they and all
@ hosts, and encamped @	 Gibeon, and made war @
 it.

10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
@, Slack not thy hand from thy @<s; come up to us quickly,
and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell
in the mountains are ga@d @? @
 us.

10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the @ of war
with him, and all the @By men of valour.

10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
delivered them into @ hand; @ @ not a man of them stand
@	 thee.

10:9 Joshua @fore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
all night.

10:10 And the LORD discomfited them @	 @, and slew them with
a @ slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth
up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from @	 @, and were
in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down @ stones
from @1 upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more @
died with hailstones than they whom the @ of @ slew with
the @Q.

10:12 Then @0 Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
up the Amorites @	 the @ of @, and he said in the
sight of @, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in
the valley of Ajalon.

10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the @
had avenged @T upon @ enemies. Is not this written in the
book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the @a of @1, and
hasted not to go down @+ a whole day.

10:14 And @ was no day like that @	 it or @ it, that the
LORD hearkened unto the @; of a man: for the LORD fought for
@.

10:15 And Joshua returned, and all @ with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.

10:16 But @ five kings fled, and hid @T in a cave at
Makkedah.

10:17 And it was told Joshua, @, The five kings are @V hid in
a cave at Makkedah.

10:18 And Joshua said, Roll @ stones upon the @P of the cave,
and set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 And stay ye not, but pursue
@ your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to
enter into @ @G: for the LORD your God hath delivered them
into your hand.

10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the @ of @ had
made an end of slaying them with a very @ slaughter, till they
were consumed, that the rest @ remained of them entered into
fenced @G.

10:21 And all the @ returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
@U: none moved his tongue @
 any of the @ of @.

10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the @P of the cave, and @( out
@J five kings unto me out of the cave.

10:23 And they did so, and @ @ @J five kings unto him out
of the cave, the king of @ , the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

10:24 And it came to pass, when they @ out @J kings unto
Joshua, that Joshua @, for all the men of @, and said unto
the captains of the men of war @ went with him, Come near, put
your feet upon the necks of @ kings. And they came near, and put
@ feet upon the necks of them.

10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
and of good courage: for thus @ the LORD do to all your enemies
@
 whom ye fight.

10:26 And @ward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
that Joshua @M, and they took them down off the trees, and cast
them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid @ stones in
the cave's @P, @ remain until this very day.

10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of
the @Q, and the king @of he utterly destroyed, them, and all
the souls that were @in; he let none remain: and he did to the
king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all @ with him, unto
Libnah, and fought @
 Libnah: 10:30 And the LORD delivered it
also, and the king @of, into the hand of @; and he smote it
with the edge of the @Q, and all the souls that were @in; he
let none remain in it; but did unto the king @of as he did unto
the king of Jericho.

10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all @ with him, unto
Lachish, and encamped @
 it, and fought @
 it: 10:32 And the
LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of @, @ took it on the
second day, and smote it with the edge of the @Q, and all the souls
that were @in, @$ to all that he had done to Libnah.

10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
smote him and his @, until he had left him none remaining.

10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all @ with
him; and they encamped @
 it, and fought @
 it: 10:35 And
they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the @Q, and
all the souls that were @in he utterly destroyed that day,
@$ to all that he had done to Lachish.

10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all @ with him, unto
Hebron; and they fought @
 it: 10:37 And they took it, and smote
it with the edge of the @Q, and the king @of, and all the
@G @of, and all the souls that were @in; he left none
remaining, @$ to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed
it utterly, and all the souls that were @in.

10:38 And Joshua returned, and all @ with him, to Debir; and
fought @
 it: 10:39 And he took it, and the king @of, and all
the @G @of; and they smote them with the edge of the @Q,
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were @in; he left none
remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the
king @of; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.

10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
and of the vale, and of the springs, and all @ kings: he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
@ @M.

10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

10:42 And all @ kings and @ land did Joshua take at one time,
@ the LORD God of @ fought for @.

10:43 And Joshua returned, and all @ with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.

11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had @) @J
@, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of
Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 11:2 And to the kings that were
on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,
and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 11:3 And to
the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the
Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to
the Hivite @[ Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

11:4 And they went out, they and all @ hosts with them, much
@, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with
horses and chariots very many.

11:5 And when all @ kings were met @?, they came and pitched
@? at the @Zs of Merom, to fight @
 @.

11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid @ of them: for
to morrow @+ this time will I deliver them up all slain @	
@: thou @ hough @ horses, and burn @ chariots with
fire.

11:7 So Joshua came, and all the @ of war with him, @
 them
by the @Zs of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of @, who smote
them, and chased them unto @ Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and
unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they
left them none remaining.

11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed @
horses, and @_ @ chariots with fire.

11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
the king @of with the @Q: for Hazor @	time was the head of
all @J kingdoms.

11:11 And they smote all the souls that were @in with the edge of
the @Q, utterly destroying them: @ was not any left to breathe:
and he @_ Hazor with fire.

11:12 And all the @G of @J kings, and all the kings of them,
did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the @Q, and he
utterly destroyed them, as @ the @< of the LORD @M.

11:13 But as for the @G that stood still in @ strength, @
burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

11:14 And all the spoil of @ @G, and the cattle, the @
of @ took for a prey unto @T; but @ man they smote
with the edge of the @Q, until they had destroyed them, @"
left they any to breathe.

11:15 As the LORD @M @ his @<, so did @ command
Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left no@7 undone of all that the LORD
@M @.

11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,
and the mountain of @, and the valley of the same; 11:17 Even
from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the
valley of Lebanon @[ mount Hermon: and all @ kings he took, and
smote them, and slew them.

11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all @J kings.

11:19 There was not a city that made @U with the @ of
@, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all @C they
took in battle.

11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden @ @s, that they @#
come @
 @ in battle, that he @B destroy them utterly, and
that they @B have no favour, but that he @B destroy them, as the
LORD @M @.

11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the
mountains of @, and from all the mountains of @: Joshua
destroyed them utterly with @ @G.

11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the @
of @: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, @ remained.

11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, @$ to all that the LORD
said unto @; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto @
@$ to @ divisions by @ tribes. And the land rested from
war.

12:1 Now @ are the kings of the land, @ the @ of @
smote, and possessed @ land on the @C side Jordan toward the
rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the
plain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in
Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, @ is upon the bank of the river
Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even
unto the river Jabbok, @ is the border of the @ of Ammon;
12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to
Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, @[ Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And the
coast of Og king of Bashan, @ was of the remnant of the giants,
that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mount
Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the
Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon
king of Heshbon.

12:6 Them did @ the @< of the LORD and the @ of @
smite: and @ the @< of the LORD gave it for a possession unto
the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

12:7 And @ are the kings of the country @ Joshua and the
@ of @ smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad
in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to
Seir; @ Joshua gave unto the tribes of @ for a possession
@$ to @ divisions; 12:8 In the mountains, and in the
valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,
and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the
Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 12:9 The
king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, @ is beside Bethel, one;
12:10 The king of @ , one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The
king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12:12 The king of
Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 12:13 The king of Debir, one; the
king of Geder, one; 12:14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,
one; 12:15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 12:16
The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 12:17 The king of
Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 12:18 The king of Aphek, one;
the king of Lasharon, one; 12:19 The king of Madon, one; the king of
Hazor, one; 12:20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,
one; 12:21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 12:22
The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 12:23 The
king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of
Gilgal, one; 12:24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and
one.

13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in @8; and the LORD said unto
him, Thou art old and stricken in @8, and @ remaineth yet very
much land to be possessed.

13:2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
Philistines, and all Geshuri, 13:3 From Sihor, @ is @	 @-,
even unto the borders of Ekron northward, @ is counted to the
Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the
Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also
the Avites: 13:4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and
Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
Amorites: 13:5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward
the sunrising, from Baalgad @[ mount Hermon unto the entering into
Hamath.

13:6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from
@	 the @ of @: only divide thou it by lot unto the
@ites for an inheritance, as I have @M thee.

13:7 Now @fore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 13:8 With whom the Reubenites
and the Gadites have received @ inheritance, @ @ gave
them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as @ the @< of the LORD
gave them; 13:9 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon,
and the city that is in the @a of the river, and all the plain of
Medeba unto Dibon; 13:10 And all the @G of Sihon king of the
Amorites, @ reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the @ of
Ammon; 13:11 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and
Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 13:12
All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, @ reigned in Ashtaroth and in
Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for @ did @
smite, and cast them out.

13:13 Nevertheless the @ of @ expelled not the Geshurites,
nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell
@ the @ites until this day.

13:14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
sacrifices of the LORD God of @ made by fire are @
inheritance, as he said unto them.

13:15 And @ gave unto the tribe of the @ of Reuben
inheritance @$ to @ families.

13:16 And @ coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
Arnon, and the city that is in the @a of the river, and all the
plain by Medeba; 13:17 Heshbon, and all her @G that are in the
plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, 13:18 And Jahaza, and
Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 13:19 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and
Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley, 13:20 And Bethpeor, and
Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, 13:21 And all the @G of the
plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, @
reigned in Heshbon, whom @ smote with the princes of Midian, Evi,
and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, @ were dukes of Sihon,
dwelling in the country.

13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the @ of
@ slay with the @Q @ them that were slain by them.

13:23 And the border of the @ of Reuben was Jordan, and the
border @of. This was the inheritance of the @ of Reuben
@ @ families, the @G and the villages @of.

13:24 And @ gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
@ of Gad @$ to @ families.

13:25 And @ coast was Jazer, and all the @G of Gilead, and
half the land of the @ of Ammon, unto Aroer that is @	
Rabbah; 13:26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and
from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 13:27 And in the valley,
Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the
kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the
edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the @C side Jordan eastward.

13:28 This is the inheritance of the @ of Gad @ @
families, the @G, and @ villages.

13:29 And @ gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and
this was the possession of the half tribe of the @ of Manasseh
by @ families.

13:30 And @ coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, @ are in Bashan,
@@score @G: 13:31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei,
@G of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the
@ of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
@ of Machir by @ families.

13:32 These are the countries @ @ did distribute for
inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the @C side Jordan, by
Jericho, eastward.

13:33 But unto the tribe of Levi @ gave not any inheritance: the
LORD God of @ was @ inheritance, as he said unto them.

14:1 And @ are the countries @ the @ of @
inherited in the land of Canaan, @ Eleazar the @6, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the @s of the tribes of the
@ of @, distributed for inheritance to them.

14:2 By lot was @ inheritance, as the LORD @M by the hand
of @, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

14:3 For @ had @= the inheritance of two tribes and an half
tribe on the @C side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none
inheritance @ them.

14:4 For the @ of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
@fore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save @G
to dwell in, with @ suburbs for @ cattle and for @
substance.

14:5 As the LORD @M @, so the @ of @ did, and
they divided the land.

14:6 Then the @ of @ came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb
the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the
@7 that the LORD said unto @ the man of God concerning me and
thee in Kadeshbarnea.

14:7 Forty @8 old was I when @ the @< of the LORD sent me
from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I @ him word @*
as it was in mine @.

14:8 Nevertheless my @3 that went up with me made the @ of
the @ melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

14:9 And @ sware on that day, @, Surely the land whereon thy
feet have trodden @ be @ inheritance, and thy @'s for
ever, @ thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.

14:10 And now, @%, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, @
forty and five @8, even since the LORD @0 this word unto @,
while the @ of @ wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo,
I am this day fourscore and five @8 old.

14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that @
sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
both to go out, and to come in.

14:12 Now @fore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD @0 in
that day; for thou @)est in that day how the Anakims were @,
and that the @G were @ and fenced: if so be the LORD will be
with me, then I @ be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.

14:13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Hebron for an inheritance.

14:14 Hebron @fore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, @ that he wholly followed
the LORD God of @.

14:15 And the name of Hebron @	 was Kirjatharba; @ Arba was a
@ man @ the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the @ of @ by
@ families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin
southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

15:2 And @ south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
the bay that looketh southward: 15:3 And it went out to the south side
to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the
south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up
to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 15:4 From thence it passed

15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the @X of Caleb, took it: and
he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to

16:1 And the lot of the @ of Joseph fell from Jordan by
Jericho, unto the @Z of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that
goeth up from Jericho @Eout mount Bethel, 16:2 And goeth out from
Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
16:3 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out @of are
at the sea.

16:4 So the @ of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took @
inheritance.

16:5 And the border of the @ of Ephraim @$ to @
families was thus: even the border of @ inheritance on the east
side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 16:6 And the border
went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the
border went @+ eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the
east to Janohah; 16:7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to
Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
and the goings out @of were at the sea. This is the inheritance of
the tribe of the @ of Ephraim by @ families.

16:9 And the separate @G for the @ of Ephraim were @
the inheritance of the @ of Manasseh, all the @G with @
villages.

16:10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
the Canaanites dwell @ the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve
@[ tribute.

17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
@Oborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the @Oborn of Manasseh, the
@ of Gilead: @ he was a man of war, @fore he had Gilead
and Bashan.

17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the @ of Manasseh by
@ families; for the @ of Abiezer, and for the @ of
Helek, and for the @ of Asriel, and for the @ of
Shechem, and for the @ of Hepher, and for the @ of
Shemida: @ were the male @ of Manasseh the son of Joseph by
@ families.

17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and @ are
the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
Tirzah.

17:4 And they came near @	 Eleazar the @6, and @	 Joshua
the son of Nun, and @	 the princes, @, The LORD @M
@ to give us an inheritance @ our @3. @N
@$ to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance
@ the @3 of @ @.

17:5 And @ fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
Gilead and Bashan, @ were on the @C side Jordan; 17:6 Because
the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance @ his sons: and the
rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
lieth @	 Shechem; and the border went along on the @c hand unto
the inhabitants of Entappuah.

17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh belonged to the @ of Ephraim; 17:9 And the coast
descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: @ @G
of Ephraim are @ the @G of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh
also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were
at the sea: 17:10 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was
Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met @? in Asher
on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns, even @@ countries.

17:12 Yet the @ of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
of @J @G; but the Canaanites @L dwell in that land.

17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the @ of @ were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly
drive them out.

17:14 And the @ of Joseph @0 unto Joshua, @, Why hast
thou @= me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a
@ @, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  17:15
And Joshua @> them, If thou be a @ @, then get thee up
to the wood country, and cut down for thyself @ in the land of the
Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.

17:16 And the @ of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:
and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have
chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and
they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

17:17 And Joshua @0 unto the @ of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
to Manasseh, @, Thou art a @ @, and hast @ power:
thou @ not have one lot only: 17:18 But the mountain @ be

they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

18:1 And the whole @` of the @ of @ assembled
@? at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the @`
@. And the land was subdued @	 them.

18:2 And @ remained @ the @ of @ @H tribes,
@ had not yet received @ inheritance.

18:3 And Joshua said unto the @ of @, How long are ye
slack to go to possess the land, @ the LORD God of your @s
hath @= you?  18:4 Give out from @ you @@ men for each
tribe: and I will send them, and they @ rise, and go @E the

@ come @* to me.

18:5 And they @ divide it into @H parts: @ @ abide in

coasts on the north.

18:6 Ye @ @fore describe the land into @H parts, and @(
the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here @	
the LORD our God.

18:7 But the Levites have no part @ you; for the @6hood of the
LORD is @ inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of
Manasseh, have received @ inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
@ @ the @< of the LORD gave them.

18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land, @, Go and walk @E the land, and
describe it, and come @* to me, that I may here cast lots for you
@	 the LORD in Shiloh.

18:9 And the men went and passed @E the land, and described it by
@G into @H parts in a book, and came @* to Joshua to the
host at Shiloh.

18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh @	 the LORD: and
@ Joshua divided the land unto the @ of @ @$ to
@ divisions.

18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the @ of Benjamin came up
@$ to @ families: and the coast of @ lot came @
between the @ of @ and the @ of Joseph.

18:12 And @ border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up
@E the mountains westward; and the goings out @of were at the
wilderness of Bethaven.

18:13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
Luz, @ is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to
Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether
Bethhoron.

18:14 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the
sea southward, from the hill that lieth @	 Bethhoron southward;
and the goings out @of were at Kirjathbaal, @ is
Kirjathjearim, a city of the @ of @: this was the west

18:15 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the

of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the
north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
south coast.

18:20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the

18:21 Now the @G of the tribe of the @ of Benjamin

20:1 The LORD also @0 unto Joshua, @, 20:2 Speak to the

22:6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
@ tents.

22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh @ had @=
possession in Bashan: but unto the @C half @of gave Joshua

sent them away also unto @ tents, then he blessed them, 22:8 And
he @0 unto them, @, Return with much riches unto your tents,

22:9 And the @ of Reuben and the @ of Gad and the half

22:10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the

22:11 And the @ of @ @) say, @., the @ of
Reuben and the @ of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have

22:12 And when the @ of @ @) of it, the whole

22:13 And the @ of @ sent unto the @ of Reuben, and

22:15 And they came unto the @ of Reuben, and to the @

 the God of @, to turn away this day from following the

22:19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the
LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession @ us: but rebel
not @
 the LORD, nor rebel @

22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed

perished not alone in his iniquity.

22:21 Then the @ of Reuben and the @ of Gad and the half

have not rather done it for fear of this @7, @, In time to
come your @ @B @K unto our @, @, What have ye
to do with the LORD God of @?  22:25 For the LORD hath made
Jordan a border between us and you, ye @ of Reuben and @

@ cease from fearing the LORD.

22:26 @N we said, Let us now prepare to build us an @\, not

22:28 @N said we, that it @ be, when they @# so say to

22:29 God forbid that we @# rebel @

22:30 And when Phinehas the @6, and the princes of the

@) the @5 that the @ of Reuben and the @ of Gad

22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the @6 said unto the

Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is @ us, @ ye

22:32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the @6, and the princes,

22:33 And the @7 pleased the @ of @; and the @

22:34 And the @ of Reuben and the @ of Gad @, the

23:1 And it came to pass a long time @ that the LORD had @=

23:2 And Joshua @, for all @, and for @ elders, and for

23:4 @., I have divided unto you by lot @ nations that remain,

23:5 And the LORD your God, he @ expel them from @	 you, and

23:6 Be ye @fore very courageous to keep and to do all that is

23:9 For the LORD hath driven out from @	 you @ nations and

23:10 One man of you @ chase a @:: for the LORD your God, he

23:11 Take good heed @fore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD

23:12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
of @ nations, even @ that remain @ you, and @ make

23:14 And, @%, this day I am going the way of all the @: and

24:1 And Joshua ga@d all the tribes of @ to Shechem, and
@, for the elders of @, and for @ heads, and for @
judges, and for @ officers; and they presented @T @	
God.

24:2 And Joshua said unto all the @, Thus @
 the LORD God of
@, Your @s dwelt on the @C side of the flood in old time,
even Terah, the @ of Abraham, and the @ of Nachor: and they
served @C gods.

24:3 And I took your @ Abraham from the @C side of the flood,
and led him @Eout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his
seed, and gave him Isaac.

24:4 And I gave unto Isaac @] and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
Seir, to possess it; but @] and his @ went down into @-.

24:5 I sent @ also and Aaron, and I plagued @-, @$ to

24:6 And I @ your @s out of @-: and ye came unto the

horsemen unto the Red sea.

24:7 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
and the @-ians, and @ the sea upon them, and covered them;
and your eyes have seen what I have done in @-: and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season.

24:8 And I @ you into the land of the Amorites, @ dwelt on
the @C side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into
your hand, that ye @B possess @ land; and I destroyed them from
@	 you.

24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
@
 @, and sent and @, Balaam the son of Beor to curse
you: 24:10 But I @L not hearken unto Balaam; @fore he blessed
you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

24:11 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
Jericho fought @
 you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and
the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

24:12 And I sent the hornet @	 you, @ drave them out from
@	 you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy

24:13 And I have @= you a land for @ ye did not labour, and
@G @ ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
oliveyards @ ye planted not do ye eat.

24:14 Now @fore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
truth: and put away the gods @ your @s served on the @C

24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this
day whom ye will serve; whether the gods @ your @s served
that were on the @C side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my @, we will serve the
LORD.

24:16 And the @ @> and said, God forbid that we @#
forsake the LORD, to serve @C gods; 24:17 For the LORD our God, he
it is that @ us up and our @s out of the land of @-,

@	 us all the @, even the Amorites @ dwelt in the land:
@fore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.

24:19 And Joshua said unto the @, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins.

24:20 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
turn and do you hurt, and consume you, @ that he hath done you
good.

24:21 And the @ said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
LORD.

24:22 And Joshua said unto the @, Ye are witnesses @

yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they
said, We are witnesses.

24:23 Now @fore put away, said he, the strange gods @ are
@ you, and incline your @ unto the LORD God of @.

24:24 And the @ said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,

24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the @ that day, and set them
a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

24:26 And Joshua wrote @ @5 in the book of the law of God, and
took a @ stone, and set it up @ @[ an oak, that was by the

24:27 And Joshua said unto all the @, @., this stone @ be

24:28 So Joshua let the @ depart, @ man unto his inheritance.

24:29 And it came to pass @ @ @, that Joshua the son of

24:31 And @ served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the

24:32 And the bones of Joseph, @ the @ of @ @ up

1:1 Now @ the @^ of Joshua it came to pass, that the @

@ go up: @%, I have delivered the land into his hand.

1:3 And @ said unto Simeon his @X, Come up with me into my
lot, that we may fight @
 the Canaanites; and I likewise will go

1:4 And @ went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
Perizzites into @ hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten

1:5 And they @V Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought @
 him,

1:6 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued @ him, and caught him,

1:7 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having @ thumbs

1:8 Now the @ of @ had fought @

1:10 And @ went @

Ahiman, and Talmai.

1:11 And from thence he went @
 the inhabitants of Debir: and the

smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter to wife.

1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger @X, took it:
and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

1:14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to
ask of her @ a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb
said unto her, What wilt thou?  1:15 And she said unto him, Give me a
blessing: for thou hast @= me a south land; give me also springs of

1:16 And the @ of the Kenite, @' @ in law, went up out

1:18 Also @ took Gaza with the coast @of, and Askelon with the

1:19 And the LORD was with @; and he drave out the inhabitants of

entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.

1:25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
the city with the edge of the @Q; but they let go the man and all
his family.

1:26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
and @, the name @of Luz: @ is the name @of unto this
day.

1:27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and
her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and
her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the
inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites @L dwell
in that land.

1:28 And it came to pass, when @ was strong, that they put the
Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

1:29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;
but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer @ them.

1:30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt @ them, and
became tributaries.

1:31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor
of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 1:32 But the Asherites dwelt @ the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them
out.

1:33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt @ the Canaanites,
the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of
Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.

1:34 And the Amorites forced the @ of Dan into the mountain:
for they @L not suffer them to come down to the valley: 1:35 But
the Amorites @L dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim:
yet the hand of the @ of Joseph prevailed, so that they became
tributaries.

1:36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,
from the rock, and upward.

2:1 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,
I made you to go up out of @-, and have @ you unto the land
@ I sware unto your @s; and I said, I will never break my
covenant with you.

2:2 And ye @ make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
@ throw down @ @\s: but ye have not obeyed my @;: why
have ye done this?  2:3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them
out from @	 you; but they @ be as thorns in your sides, and
@ gods @ be a snare unto you.

2:4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD @0 @ @5

@;, and wept.

2:5 And they @, the name of that @' Bochim: and they sacrificed

2:6 And when Joshua had let the @ go, the @ of @ went
@ man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

2:7 And the @ served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the @
works of the LORD, that he did for @.

2:8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the @< of the LORD, died, being an
@/ and ten @8 old.

2:9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
Gaash.

2:10 And also all that generation were ga@d unto @ @s:
and @ arose @F generation @ them, @ knew not the
LORD, nor yet the works @ he had done for @.

2:11 And the @ of @ did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
served Baalim: 2:12 And they forsook the LORD God of @ @s,
@ @ them out of the land of @-, and followed @C gods,
of the gods of the @ that were round @+ them, and bowed
@T unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot @
 @, and he
delivered them into the @D of spoilers that spoiled them, and he
sold them into the @D of @ enemies round @+, so that they
could not any longer stand @	 @ enemies.

2:15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was @

them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto
them: and they were @ly distressed.

2:16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, @ delivered them out
of the hand of @J that spoiled them.

2:17 And yet they @L not hearken unto @ judges, but they went a
whoring @ @C gods, and bowed @T unto them: they turned
quickly out of the way @ @ @s walked in, obeying the
commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.

2:18 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with
the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of @ enemies all the
days of the judge: for it repented the LORD @ of @ groanings
by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

2:19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,
and corrupted @T more than @ @s, in following @C
gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from
@ own doings, nor from @ stubborn way.

2:20 And the anger of the LORD was hot @
 @; and he said,
Because that this @ hath transgressed my covenant @ I
@M @ @s, and have not hearkened unto my @;; 2:21 I
also will not hence@ drive out any from @	 them of the nations
@ Joshua left when he died: 2:22 That @E them I may prove
@, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk @in, as
@ @s did keep it, or not.

2:23 @N the LORD left @J nations, @S driving them out
hastily; @" delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

3:1 Now @ are the nations @ the LORD left, to prove @ by
them, even as many of @ as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
3:2 Only that the generations of the @ of @ @B know, to
teach them war, at the least such as @	 knew no@7 @of; 3:3
Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the
Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount
Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

3:4 And they were to prove @ by them, to know whether they @L
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, @ he @M @
@s by the hand of @.

3:5 And the @ of @ dwelt @ the Canaanites, Hittites,
and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 3:6 And they
took @ daughters to be @ wives, and gave @ daughters to
@ sons, and served @ gods.

3:7 And the @ of @ did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
forgat the LORD @ God, and served Baalim and the groves.

3:8 @N the anger of the LORD was hot @
 @, and he
sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and
the @ of @ served Chushanrishathaim eight @8.

3:9 And when the @ of @ cried unto the LORD, the LORD
raised up a deliverer to the @ of @, who delivered them,
even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger @X.

3:10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged @,
and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of
Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed @

Chushanrishathaim.

3:11 And the land had rest forty @8. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
died.

3:12 And the @ of @ did evil @* in the sight of the
LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab @
 @,
@ they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

3:13 And he ga@d unto him the @ of Ammon and Amalek, and
went and smote @, and possessed the city of palm trees.

3:14 So the @ of @ served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
@8.

3:15 But when the @ of @ cried unto the LORD, the LORD
raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man
lefthanded: and by him the @ of @ sent a present unto
Eglon the king of Moab.

3:16 But Ehud made him a dagger @ had two edges, of a cubit
length; and he did gird it @[ his raiment upon his @c thigh.

3:17 And he @ the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was
a very fat man.

3:18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
the @ that bare the present.

3:19 But he @9 turned @* from the quarries that were by
Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said,
Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

3:20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
@ he had for @9 alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from
God unto thee.

And he arose out of his seat.

3:21 And Ehud put @ his left hand, and took the dagger from his
@c thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 3:22 And the haft also went
in @ the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he
could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

3:23 Then Ehud went @ @E the porch, and shut the doors of the
parlour upon him, and locked them.

3:24 When he was gone out, his @<s came; and when they saw that,
@%, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he
covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

3:25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, @%, he opened
not the doors of the parlour; @fore they took a key, and opened
them: and, @%, @ lord was fallen down dead on the @.

3:26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

3:27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in
the mountain of Ephraim, and the @ of @ went down with him
from the mount, and he @	 them.

3:28 And he said unto them, Follow @ me: for the LORD hath
delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down
@ him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not
a man to pass over.

3:29 And they slew of Moab at that time @+ ten @: men, all
lusty, and all men of valour; and @ escaped not a man.

3:30 So Moab was subdued that day @[ the hand of @. And the
land had rest fourscore @8.

3:31 And @ him was Shamgar the son of Anath, @ slew of the
Philistines six @/ men with an ox goad: and he also delivered
@.

4:1 And the @ of @ @* did evil in the sight of the
LORD, when Ehud was dead.

4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, @ dwelt in
Harosheth of the Gentiles.

4:3 And the @ of @ cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
@/ chariots of iron; and twenty @8 he @Bily oppressed the
@ of @.

4:4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged @
at that time.

4:5 And she dwelt @[ the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the @ of @ came up to her for
judgment.

4:6 And she sent and @, Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of @
@M, @, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten @: men of the @ of Naphtali and of the @ of
Zebulun?  4:7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera,
the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and
I will deliver him into @ hand.

4:8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:
but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

4:9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest @ not be for @ honour; for the LORD
@ sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and
went with Barak to Kedesh.

4:10 And Barak @, Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
with ten @: men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, @ was of the @ of Hobab the
@ in law of @, had severed @9 from the Kenites, and
pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, @ is by Kedesh.

4:12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
to mount Tabor.

4:13 And Sisera ga@d @? all his chariots, even nine @/
chariots of iron, and all the @ that were with him, from
Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

4:14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in @ the
LORD hath delivered Sisera into @ hand: is not the LORD gone out
@	 thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten @: men
@ him.

4:15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
his host, with the edge of the @Q @	 Barak; so that Sisera
lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

4:16 But Barak pursued @ the chariots, and @ the host, unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
edge of the @Q; and @ was not a man left.

4:17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife
of Heber the Kenite: for @ was @U between Jabin the king of
Hazor and the @ of Heber the Kenite.

4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into
the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

4:19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little @Z to
@b; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him
@b, and covered him.

4:20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
@ be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is
@ any man here? that thou @ say, No.

4:21 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into
his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep
and weary. So he died.

4:22 And, @%, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest. And when he came into her tent, @%, Sisera lay dead, and
the nail was in his temples.

4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan @	 the
@ of @.

4:24 And the hand of the @ of @ prospered, and prevailed
@
 Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king
of Canaan.

5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
@, 5:2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of @, when the
@ willingly offered @T.

5:3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of @.

5:4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of
the field of Edom, the @ trembled, and the @1s dropped, the
clouds also dropped @Z.

5:5 The mountains melted from @	 the LORD, even that Sinai from
@	 the LORD God of @.

5:6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked @E byways.

5:7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in @,
until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a m@C in @.

5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was @ a shield
or spear seen @ forty @: in @?  5:9 My @ is toward
the governors of @, that offered @T willingly @ the
@. Bless ye the LORD.

5:10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
walk by the way.

5:11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the @'s
of drawing @Z, @ @ they rehearse the @ceous acts of the
LORD, even the @ceous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages
in @: then @ the @ of the LORD go down to the gates.

5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,
and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

5:13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
@ the @: the LORD made me have dominion over the @By.

5:14 Out of Ephraim was @ a root of them @
 Amalek; @
thee, Benjamin, @ thy @; out of Machir came down governors,
and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of
Reuben @ were @ thoughts of @.

5:16 Why abodest thou @ the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of
the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben @ were @ searchings of
@.

5:17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

5:18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a @ that jeoparded @ lives
unto the @^ in the high @'s of the field.

5:19 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
Taanach by the @Zs of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

5:20 They fought from @1; the stars in @ courses fought
@
 Sisera.

5:21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

5:22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
the pransings of @ @By ones.

5:23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the
inhabitants @of; @ they came not to the help of the LORD, to

 the @By.

5:24 Blessed above women @ Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
blessed @ she be above women in the tent.

5:25 He asked @Z, and she gave him milk; she @ @ butter
in a lordly dish.

5:26 She put her hand to the nail, and her @c hand to the workmen's
hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
when she had pierced and stricken @E his temples.

5:27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,
he fell: where he bowed, @ he fell down dead.

5:28 The m@C of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried @E
the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the
wheels of his chariots?  5:29 Her wise ladies @> her, yea, she
returned answer to herself, 5:30 Have they not sped? have they not
divided the prey; to @ man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of
divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers
colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that
take the spoil?  5:31 So let all @ enemies perish, O LORD: but let
them that love him be as the sun when he goeth @ in his @B. And
the land had rest forty @8.

6:1 And the @ of @ did evil in the sight of the LORD: and
the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian @H @8.

6:2 And the hand of Midian prevailed @
 @: and @ of
the Midianites the @ of @ made them the dens @ are in

6:3 And so it was, when @ had sown, that the Midianites came up,
and the Amalekites, and the @ of the east, even they came up
@
 them; 6:4 And they encamped @
 them, and destroyed the
increase of the @, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no
sustenance for @, @" sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

6:5 For they came up with @ cattle and @ tents, and they came
as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and @ camels were
@S number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.

6:6 And @ was @ly impoverished @ of the Midianites; and
the @ of @ cried unto the LORD.

6:7 And it came to pass, when the @ of @ cried unto the
LORD @ of the Midianites, 6:8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto
the @ of @, @ said unto them, Thus @
 the LORD God
of @, I @ you up from @-, and @ you @ out of
the @ of bondage; 6:9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the

them out from @	 you, and gave you @ land; 6:10 And I said
unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my @;.

6:11 And @ came an angel of the LORD, and sat @[ an oak @
was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son
Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the
Midianites.

6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,
The LORD is with thee, thou @By man of valour.

6:13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles @ our
@s told us of, @, Did not the LORD @( us up from @-?
but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the @D of
the Midianites.

6:14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy @B, and
thou @ save @ from the hand of the Midianites: have not I
sent thee?  6:15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith @ I
save @?  @%, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
least in my @'s @.

6:16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
@ smite the Midianites as one man.

6:17 And he said unto him, If now I have @V grace in thy sight,
then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

6:18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and @(
@ my present, and set it @	 thee. And he said, I will tarry
until thou come @*.

6:19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of
an ephah of flour: the @R he put in a basket, and he put the broth
in a pot, and @ it out unto him @[ the oak, and presented it.

6:20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the @R and the
unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.
And he did so.

6:21 Then the angel of the LORD put @ the end of the staff that
was in his hand, and touched the @R and the unleavened cakes; and
@ rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the @R and the
unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his
sight.

6:22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for @ I have seen an angel of the
LORD face to face.

6:23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
@ not die.

6:24 Then Gideon built an @\ @ unto the LORD, and @, it
Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

6:25 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
Take thy @'s young bullock, even the second bullock of @H
@8 old, and throw down the @\ of Baal that thy @ hath, and
cut down the grove that is by it: 6:26 And build an @\ unto the
LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered @', and take
the second bullock, and offer a @_ sacrifice with the wood of the
grove @ thou @ cut down.

6:27 Then Gideon took ten men of his @<s, and did as the LORD had
said unto him: and so it was, @ he feared his @'s
@hold, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day,
that he did it by night.

6:28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, @%,
the @\ of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was
by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the @\ that was
built.

6:29 And they said one to @F, Who hath done this @7? And when
they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done
this @7.

6:30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that
he may die: @ he hath cast down the @\ of Baal, and @
he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

6:31 And Joash said unto all that stood @
 him, Will ye plead for
Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to
@^ whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for

6:32 @N on that day he @, him Jerubbaal, @, Let Baal

6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the @ of

valley of Jezreel.

6:34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a

6:35 And he sent messengers @Eout all Manasseh; who also was
ga@d @ him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto
Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

6:36 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save @ by mine hand,
as thou hast said, 6:37 @., I will put a fleece of wool in the
floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all
the @ beside, then @ I know that thou wilt save @ by mine

6:38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
fleece @?, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of
@Z.

6:39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not @ anger be hot @
 me,
and I will @K but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this
once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon
all the ground let @ be dew.

6:40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,
and @ was dew on all the ground.

7:1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the @ that were with
him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the
host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of
Moreh, in the valley.

7:2 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The @ that are with thee are
too many for me to give the Midianites into @ @D, lest @
vaunt @T @

7:3 Now @fore go to, proclaim in the ears of the @, @,
Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from

7:4 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The @ are yet too many; @(

7:5 So he @ down the @ unto the @Z: and the LORD said
unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the @Z with his tongue, as a

7:6 And the number of them that lapped, putting @ hand to @

7:7 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the @@ @/ men that

and let all the @C @ go @ man unto his @'.

7:8 So the @ took victuals in @ hand, and @ trumpets: and
he sent all the rest of @ @ man unto his tent, and retained
@J @@ @/ men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the

7:9 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into @

7:10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy @< down

7:12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the @ of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and
@ camels were @S number, as the sand by the sea side for

7:13 And when Gideon was come, @%, @ was a man that told a

7:14 And his fellow @> and said, This is no@7 else save the

7:15 And it was so, when Gideon @) the telling of the dream, and

7:16 And he divided the @@ @/ men into @@ companies, and he
put a trumpet in @ man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps

7:17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, @%,

7:18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow

7:19 So Gideon, and the @/ men that were with him, came unto the

7:20 And the @@ companies blew the trumpets, and brake the

7:22 And the @@ @/ blew the trumpets, and the LORD set @

7:23 And the men of @ ga@d @T @? out of
Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued @
the Midianites.

7:24 And Gideon sent messengers @Eout all mount Ephraim, @,

Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim ga@d @T
@?, and took the @Zs unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

7:25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and
they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress
of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and @ the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon on the @C side Jordan.

8:1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
thus, that thou @,st us not, when thou wentest to fight with the
Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.

8:2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage
of Abiezer?  8:3 God hath delivered into your @D the princes of
Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?
Then @ anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

8:4 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the @@
@/ men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

8:5 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of

pursuing @ Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

8:6 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the @D of Zebah and

8:7 And Gideon said, @N when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and

8:8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and @0 unto them likewise: and

8:9 And he @0 also unto the men of Penuel, @, When I come

8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the

8:12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued @ them, and took
the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the

8:13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle @	 the sun

8:15 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, @. Zebah and

Succoth.

8:17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the

8:18 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were

8:19 And he said, They were my @3, even the sons of my m@C:

8:20 And he said unto Jether his @Oborn, Up, and slay them. But the

8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as
the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on @ camels'

8:22 Then the men of @ said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both

8:23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, @"

8:24 And Gideon said unto them, I @L desire a request of you, that

8:27 And Gideon made an ephod @of, and put it in his city, even in

8:28 Thus was Midian subdued @	 the @ of @, so that

8:29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own @.

8:30 And Gideon had @@score and ten sons of his body begotten: for

8:31 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,

8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was

8:33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the

8:34 And the @ of @ remembered not the LORD @ God, who

9:7 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of

Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

9:8 The trees went @ on a time to anoint a king over them; and

9:9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over

9:11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,

9:13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, @

said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.

9:15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me

let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

9:16 Now @fore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye

9:22 When Abimelech had reigned @@ @8 over @, 9:23 Then God

9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his @3, and went over to

9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled @	 him, and many were

11:7 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,
and expel me out of my @'s @? and why are ye come unto me now
when ye are in distress?  11:8 And the elders of Gilead said unto
Jephthah, @N we turn @* to thee now, that thou mayest go
with us, and fight @
 the @ of Ammon, and be our head over
all the inhabitants of Gilead.

11:9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye @( me home
@* to fight @
 the @ of Ammon, and the LORD deliver
them @	 me, @ I be your head?  11:10 And the elders of Gilead
said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so
@$ to thy @5.

11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the @
made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his
@5 @	 the LORD in Mizpeh.

11:12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the @ of
Ammon, @, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come
@
 me to fight in my land?  11:13 And the king of the @ of
Ammon @> unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because @ took
away my land, when they came up out of @-, from Arnon even unto
Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now @fore restore @J lands @*
@Uably.

11:14 And Jephthah sent messengers @* unto the king of the @
of Ammon: 11:15 And said unto him, Thus @
 Jephthah, @ took
not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the @ of Ammon:
11:16 But when @ came up from @-, and walked @E the
wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 11:17 Then @
sent messengers unto the king of Edom, @, Let me, I pray thee,
pass @E thy land: but the king of Edom @L not hearken @to.
And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he @L not
consent: and @ abode in Kadesh.

11:18 Then they went along @E the wilderness, and compassed the
land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the
land of Moab, and pitched on the @C side of Arnon, but came not
within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.

11:19 And @ sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the
king of Heshbon; and @ said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,
@E thy land into my @'.

11:20 But Sihon trusted not @ to pass @E his coast: but
Sihon ga@d all his @ @?, and pitched in Jahaz, and
fought @
 @.

11:21 And the LORD God of @ delivered Sihon and all his @
into the hand of @, and they smote them: so @ possessed all
the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

11:22 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

11:23 So now the LORD God of @ hath dispossessed the Amorites
from @	 his @ @, and @#est thou possess it?  11:24
Wilt not thou possess that @ Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God @ drive out from @	
us, them will we possess.

11:25 And now art thou any @7 better than Balak the son of Zippor,
king of Moab? did he ever strive @
 @, or did he ever fight
@
 them, 11:26 While @ dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and
in Aroer and her towns, and in all the @G that be along by the
coasts of Arnon, @@ @/ @8? why @fore did ye not recover
them within that time?  11:27 Wherefore I have not sinned @

thee, but thou doest me wrong to war @
 me: the LORD the Judge be
judge this day between the @ of @ and the @ of
Ammon.

11:28 Howbeit the king of the @ of Ammon hearkened not unto the
@5 of Jephthah @ he sent him.

11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from
Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the @ of Ammon.

11:30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou @
@S fail deliver the @ of Ammon into mine @D, 11:31 Then
it @ be, that whatsoever cometh @ of the doors of my @ to
meet me, when I return in @U from the @ of Ammon, @
surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a @_ @&.

11:32 So Jephthah passed over unto the @ of Ammon to fight
@
 them; and the LORD delivered them into his @D.

11:33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
even twenty @G, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very
@ slaughter. Thus the @ of Ammon were subdued @	 the
@ of @.

11:34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his @, and, @%, his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she
was his only child; beside her he had @" son nor daughter.

11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast @ me very low, and thou
art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my @P unto the
LORD, and I cannot go back.

11:36 And she said unto him, My @, if thou hast opened thy @P
unto the LORD, do to me @$ to that @ hath proceeded out of
thy @P; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of
@ enemies, even of the @ of Ammon.

11:37 And she said unto her @, Let this @7 be done for me: let
me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and
bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

11:38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
mountains.

11:39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned
unto her @, who did with her @$ to his vow @ he had
vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in @, 11:40 That
the daughters of @ went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah
the Gileadite four days in a year.

12:1 And the men of Ephraim ga@d @T @?, and went
northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to
fight @
 the @ of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with
thee? we will burn @ @ upon thee with fire.

12:2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my @ were at @ strife
with the @ of Ammon; and when I @, you, ye delivered me not
out of @ @D.

12:3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
@D, and passed over @
 the @ of Ammon, and the LORD
delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me
this day, to fight @
 me?  12:4 Then Jephthah ga@d @?
all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead
smote Ephraim, @ they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of
Ephraim @ the Ephraimites, and @ the Manassites.

12:5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan @	 the
Ephraimites: and it was so, that when @J Ephraimites @ were
escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,
Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 12:6 Then said they unto him,
Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to
pronounce it @c. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages
of Jordan: and @ fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and
two @:.

12:7 And Jephthah judged @ six @8. Then died Jephthah the
Gileadite, and was buried in one of the @G of Gilead.

12:8 And @ him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged @.

12:9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he
judged @ @H @8.

12:10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

12:11 And @ him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged @; and he judged
@ ten @8.

12:12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
country of Zebulun.

12:13 And @ him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
@.

12:14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
@@score and ten ass colts: and he judged @ eight @8.

12:15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

13:1 And the @ of @ did evil @* in the sight of the
LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines
forty @8.

13:2 And @ was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.

13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto
her, @. now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou @
conceive, and bear a son.

13:4 Now @fore beware, I pray thee, and @b not wine nor strong
@b, and eat not any unclean @7: 13:5 For, lo, thou @
conceive, and bear a son; and no razor @ come on his head: for the
child @ be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he @ begin
to deliver @ out of the hand of the Philistines.

13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, @, A man of God
came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel
of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, @" told
he me his name: 13:7 But he said unto me, @., thou @ conceive,
and bear a son; and now @b no wine nor strong @b, @" eat
any unclean @7: for the child @ be a Nazarite to God from the
womb to the day of his @^.

13:8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man
of God @ thou didst send come @* unto us, and teach us what we
@ do unto the child that @ be born.

13:9 And God hearkened to the @; of Manoah; and the angel of God
came @* unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her
husband was not with her.

13:10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
said unto him, @., the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto
me the @C day.

13:11 And Manoah arose, and went @ his wife, and came to the man,
and said unto him, Art thou the man that @0st unto the woman? And
he said, I am.

13:12 And Manoah said, Now let thy @5 come to pass. How @ we
order the child, and how @ we do unto him?  13:13 And the angel of
the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her
beware.

13:14 She may not eat of any @7 that cometh of the vine, @"
let her @b wine or strong @b, nor eat any unclean @7: all
that I @M her let her observe.

13:15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
detain thee, until we @ have made ready a kid for thee.

13:16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
me, I will not eat of thy @d: and if thou wilt offer a @_
@&, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that
he was an angel of the LORD.

13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
that when thy @s come to pass we may do thee honour?  13:18 And
the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus @ my
name, seeing it is secret?  13:19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat
@&, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did
wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.

13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward @1 from
off the @\, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the
@\. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on @ faces
to the ground.

13:21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We @ surely die, @ we
have seen God.

13:23 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,
he @L not have received a @_ @& and a meat @& at our
@D, @" @L he have shewed us all @ @, nor @L as
at this time have told us such @ as @.

13:24 And the woman bare a son, and @, his name Samson: and the
child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

14:1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
the daughters of the Philistines.

14:2 And he came up, and told his @ and his m@C, and said, I
have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now
@fore get her for me to wife.

14:3 Then his @ and his m@C said unto him, Is @ never a
woman @ the daughters of thy @3, or @ all my @,
that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And
Samson said unto his @, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

14:4 But his @ and his m@C knew not that it was of the LORD,
that he sought an occasion @
 the Philistines: for at that time
the Philistines had dominion over @.

14:5 Then went Samson down, and his @ and his m@C, to Timnath,
and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, @%, a young lion roared
@
 him.

14:6 And the Spirit of the LORD came @Bily upon him, and he rent
him as he @L have rent a kid, and he had no@7 in his hand: but
he told not his @ or his m@C what he had done.

14:7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
Samson well.

14:8 And @ a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to
see the carcase of the lion: and, @%, @ was a swarm of bees
and honey in the carcase of the lion.

14:9 And he took @of in his @D, and went on eating, and came to
his @ and m@C, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told
not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

14:10 So his @ went down unto the woman: and Samson made @ a
feast; for so used the young men to do.

14:11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they @ thirty
companions to be with him.

14:12 And Samson said unto them, I will now put @ a riddle unto
you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the @H days of the
feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty
change of garments: 14:13 But if ye cannot declare it me, then @
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said
unto him, Put @ thy riddle, that we may hear it.

14:14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came @ meat, and out
of the strong came @ sweetness. And they could not in @@ days
expound the riddle.

14:15 And it came to pass on the @Hth day, that they said unto
Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the
riddle, lest we burn thee and thy @'s @ with fire: have ye
@, us to take that we have? is it not so?  14:16 And Samson's wife
wept @	 him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not:
thou hast put @ a riddle unto the @ of my @, and hast
not told it me. And he said unto her, @., I have not told it my
@ nor my m@C, and @ I tell it thee?  14:17 And she wept
@	 him the @H days, while @ feast lasted: and it came to
pass on the @Hth day, that he told her, @ she lay sore upon
him: and she told the riddle to the @ of her @.

14:18 And the men of the city said unto him on the @Hth day @	
the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger
than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my
heifer, ye had not @V out my riddle.

14:19 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took @ spoil, and gave
change of garments unto them @ expounded the riddle. And his anger
was kindled, and he went up to his @'s @.

14:20 But Samson's wife was @= to his companion, whom he had used
as his friend.

15:1 But it came to pass within a while @, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will
go in to my wife into the chamber. But her @ @L not suffer him
to go in.

15:2 And her @ said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her; @fore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

15:3 And Samson said concerning them, Now @ I be more blameless
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

15:4 And Samson went and caught @@ @/ foxes, and took
firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the @a
between two tails.

15:5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
standing corn of the Philistines, and @_ up both the shocks, and
also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

15:6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they @>,
Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, @ he had taken his wife,
and @= her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and @_
her and her @ with fire.

15:7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I
be avenged of you, and @ that I will cease.

15:8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a @ slaughter: and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

15:9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in @, and spread
@T in Lehi.

15:10 And the men of @ said, Why are ye come up @

they @>, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath

15:11 Then @@ @: men of @ went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are
rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said

15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said
unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

15:13 And they @0 unto him, @, No; but we will bind thee fast,
and deliver thee into @ hand: but surely we will not kill thee.
And they bound him with two new cords, and @ him up from the
rock.

15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted @
 him:
and the Spirit of the LORD came @Bily upon him, and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax that was @_ with fire, and his
bands loosed from off his @D.

15:15 And he @V a new jawbone of an ass, and put @ his hand,
and took it, and slew a @: men @with.

15:16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,

15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of @King, that

15:18 And he was sore athirst, and @, on the LORD, and said, Thou

Enhakkore, @ is in Lehi unto this day.

15:20 And he judged @ in the days of the Philistines twenty

16:1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw @ an harlot, and went in
unto her.

16:2 And it was told the Gazites, @, Samson is come hither. And
they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of
the city, and were quiet all the night, @, In the morning, when
it is day, we @ kill him.

16:3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with
them, bar and all, and put them upon his @#ers, and carried them
up to the top of an hill that is @	 Hebron.

16:4 And it came to pass @ward, that he loved a woman in the
valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto
her, Entice him, and see wherein his @ strength lieth, and by what
means we may prevail @

and we will give thee @ one of us eleven @/ pieces of silver.

16:6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
@ strength lieth, and wherewith thou @Best be bound to afflict

16:7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with @H green withs

16:9 Now @ were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the

And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the

16:10 And Delilah said unto Samson, @., thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou @Best be
bound.

16:11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that

16:12 Delilah @fore took new ropes, and bound him @with, and
said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And @ were
liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his

16:13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: tell me wherewith thou @Best be bound. And he said
unto her, If thou weavest the @H locks of my head with the web.

16:14 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and

16:15 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when

16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her @5,

told her all his @, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor
upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my m@C's

become weak, and be like any @C man.

16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his @, she

16:19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she @, for a man,

began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

16:20 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at @C times @	,

16:21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and @

16:23 Then the lords of the Philistines ga@d them @? for to

16:24 And when the @ saw him, they praised @ god: for they

me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O
God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

16:29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon @ the
@ stood, and on @ it was borne up, of the one with his @c
hand, and of the @C with his left.

16:30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
@9 with all his @B; and the @ fell upon the lords, and
upon all the @ that were @in. So the dead @ he slew at
his @^ were more than they @ he slew in his life.

16:31 Then his @3 and all the @ of his @ came down, and
took him, and @ him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol
in the burying@' of Manoah his @. And he judged @ twenty
@8.

17:1 And @ was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

17:2 And he said unto his m@C, The eleven @/ shekels of silver
that were taken from thee, @+ @ thou cursedst, and @0st of
also in mine ears, @%, the silver is with me; I took it. And his
m@C said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.

17:3 And when he had restored the eleven @/ shekels of silver to
his m@C, his m@C said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto
the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten
image: now @fore I will restore it unto thee.

17:4 Yet he restored the money unto his m@C; and his m@C took
two @/ shekels of silver, and gave them to the @Ver, who made
@of a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the @
of Micah.

17:5 And the man Micah had an @ of gods, and made an ephod, and
teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his @6.

17:6 In @J days @ was no king in @, but @ man did that
@ was @c in his own eyes.

17:7 And @ was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
@, who was a Levite, and he sojourned @.

17:8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
sojourn where he could find a @': and he came to mount Ephraim to
the @ of Micah, as he journeyed.

17:9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may
find a @'.

17:10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a @
and a @6, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year,
and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

17:11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
man was unto him as one of his sons.

17:12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
@6, and was in the @ of Micah.

17:13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
seeing I have a Levite to my @6.

18:1 In @J days @ was no king in @: and in @J days the
tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto
that day all @ inheritance had not fallen unto them @ the
tribes of @.

18:2 And the @ of Dan sent of @ family five men from @
coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the
land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:
who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the @ of Micah, they
lodged @.

18:3 When they were by the @ of Micah, they knew the @; of the
young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him,
Who @ thee hither? and what makest thou in this @'? and what
hast thou here?  18:4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth
Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his @6.

18:5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that
we may know whether our way @ we go @ be prosperous.

18:6 And the @6 said unto them, Go in @U: @	 the LORD is
your way wherein ye go.

18:7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the @
that were @in, how they dwelt careless, @ the manner of the
Zidonians, quiet and secure; and @ was no magistrate in the land,
that @B put them to shame in any @7; and they were far from the
Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

18:8 And they came unto @ @3 to Zorah and Eshtaol: and @
@3 said unto them, What say ye?  18:9 And they said, Arise, that
we may go up @
 them: for we have seen the land, and, @%, it
is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to
possess the land.

18:10 When ye go, ye @ come unto a @ secure, and to a large
land: for God hath @= it into your @D; a @' where @ is no
want of any @7 that is in the @.

18:11 And @ went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six @/ men appointed with weapons of
war.

18:12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in @:
wherefore they @, that @' Mahanehdan unto this day: @%, it
is behind Kirjathjearim.

18:13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
@ of Micah.

18:14 Then @> the five men that went to spy out the country of
Laish, and said unto @ @3, Do ye know that @ is in @
@s an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?
now @fore consider what ye have to do.

18:15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the @ of the young
man the Levite, even unto the @ of Micah, and saluted him.

18:16 And the six @/ men appointed with @ weapons of war,
@ were of the @ of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

18:17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came
in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the molten image: and the @6 stood in the entering
of the gate with the six @/ men that were appointed with weapons
of war.

18:18 And @ went into Micah's @, and fetched the carved image,
the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the
@6 unto them, What do ye?  18:19 And they said unto him, Hold thy
@U, lay @ hand upon thy @P, and go with us, and be to us a
@ and a @6: is it better for thee to be a @6 unto the
@ of one man, or that thou be a @6 unto a tribe and a family
in @?  18:20 And the @6's @ was glad, and he took the
ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the @a
of the @.

18:21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
cattle and the carriage @	 them.

18:22 And when they were a good way from the @ of Micah, the men
that were in the @s near to Micah's @ were ga@d @?,
and overtook the @ of Dan.

18:23 And they cried unto the @ of Dan. And they turned @
faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with
such a company?  18:24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods @ I
made, and the @6, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and
what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  18:25 And the
@ of Dan said unto him, Let not thy @; be @) @ us,
lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the
lives of thy @hold.

18:26 And the @ of Dan went @ way: and when Micah saw that
they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his @.

18:27 And they took the @ @ Micah had made, and the @6
@ he had, and came unto Laish, unto a @ that were at quiet
and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the @Q, and @_
the city with fire.

18:28 And @ was no deliverer, @ it was far from Zidon, and
they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth
by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt @in.

18:29 And they @, the name of the city Dan, @ the name of Dan
@ @, who was born unto @: howbeit the name of the city
was Laish at the @O.

18:30 And the @ of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were @6s
to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

18:31 And they set them up Micah's graven image, @ he made, all
the time that the @ of God was in Shiloh.

19:1 And it came to pass in @J days, when @ was no king in
@, that @ was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of
mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

19:2 And his concubine played the whore @
 him, and went away
from him unto her @'s @ to Bethlehemjudah, and was @ four
whole months.

19:3 And her husband arose, and went @ her, to @K friendly unto
her, and to @( her @*, having his @< with him, and a couple

@ of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

19:4 And his @ in law, the damsel's @, retained him; and he
abode with him @@ days: so they did eat and @b, and lodged
@.

19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in
the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's @ said
unto his son in law, Comfort @ @ with a morsel of @d, and
@ward go your way.

19:6 And they sat down, and did eat and @b both of them @?:
for the damsel's @ had said unto the man, Be content, I pray
thee, and tarry all night, and let @ @ be merry.

19:7 And when the man rose up to depart, his @ in law urged him:
@fore he lodged @ @*.

19:8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and
the damsel's @ said, Comfort @ @, I pray thee. And they
tarried until @noon, and they did eat both of them.

19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
his @<, his @ in law, the damsel's @, said unto him,
@., now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all
night: @%, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that @ @
may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou
mayest go home.

19:10 But the man @L not tarry that night, but he rose up and
departed, and came over @
 Jebus, @ is @ ; and @
were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.

19:11 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
@< said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in
into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

19:12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into
the city of a stranger, that is not of the @ of @; we will
pass over to Gibeah.

19:13 And he said unto his @<, Come, and let us draw near to one
of @ @'s to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

19:14 And they passed on and went @ way; and the sun went down
upon them when they were by Gibeah, @ belongeth to Benjamin.

19:15 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:
and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for
@ was no man that took them into his @ to lodging.

19:16 And, @%, @ came an old man from his work out of the
field at even, @ was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in
Gibeah: but the men of the @' were Benjamites.

19:17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and
whence comest thou?  19:18 And he said unto him, We are passing from
Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and
I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the @ of the LORD;
and @ is no man that receiveth me to @.

19:19 Yet @ is both straw and provender for our asses; and @
is @d and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young
man @ is with thy @<s: @ is no want of any @7.

19:20 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

19:21 So he @ him into his @, and gave provender unto the
asses: and they washed @ feet, and did eat and @b.

19:22 Now as they were making @ @s merry, @%, the men of
the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the @ round @+, and
beat at the door, and @0 to the master of the @, the old man,
@, Bring @ the man that came into @ @, that we may
know him.

19:23 And the man, the master of the @, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my @3, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
seeing that this man is come into mine @, do not this folly.

19:24 @., here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
will @( out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth
good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a @7.

19:25 But the men @L not hearken to him: so the man took his
concubine, and @ her @ unto them; and they knew her, and
abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to
spring, they let her go.

19:26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at
the door of the man's @ where her lord was, till it was light.

19:27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
@, and went out to go his way: and, @%, the woman his
concubine was fallen down at the door of the @, and her @D were
upon the threshold.

19:28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
@>.

Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him
unto his @'.

19:29 And when he was come into his @, he took a knife, and laid
hold on his concubine, and divided her, @? with her bones, into
twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of @.

19:30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
done nor seen from the day that the @ of @ came up out of
the land of @- unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and
@K your minds.

20:1 Then all the @ of @ went out, and the @`
was ga@d @? as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the
land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

20:2 And the chief of all the @, even of all the tribes of
@, presented @T in the assembly of the @ of God,
four @/ @: footmen that drew @Q.

20:3 (Now the @ of Benjamin @) that the @ of @
were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the @ of @, Tell us,
how was this wickedness?  20:4 And the Levite, the husband of the
woman that was slain, @> and said, I came into Gibeah that
belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

20:5 And the men of Gibeah rose @
 me, and beset the @ round
@+ upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine
have they forced, that she is dead.

20:6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
@Eout all the country of the inheritance of @: for they have
committed lewdness and folly in @.

20:7 @., ye are all @ of @; give here your advice and
counsel.

20:8 And all the @ arose as one man, @, We will not any of

20:9 But now this @ be the @7 @ we will do to Gibeah; we

@$ to all the folly that they have wrought in @.

20:11 So all the men of @ were ga@d @
 the city, knit
@? as one man.

20:12 And the tribes of @ sent men @E all the tribe of
Benjamin, @, What wickedness is this that is done @ you?
20:13 Now @fore deliver us the men, the @ of Belial, @

20:14 But the @ of Benjamin ga@d @T @? out of
the @G unto Gibeah, to go out to battle @
 the @ of

20:15 And the @ of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of

20:16 Among all this @ @ were @H @/ chosen men

20:17 And the men of @, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
@/ @: men that drew @Q: all @ were men of war.

20:18 And the @ of @ arose, and went up to the @ of
God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us @ go up @O
to the battle @
 the @ of Benjamin? And the LORD said,
@ @ go up @O.

20:19 And the @ of @ rose up in the morning, and encamped
@
 Gibeah.

20:20 And the men of @ went out to battle @
 Benjamin; and
the men of @ put @T in array to fight @
 them at
Gibeah.

20:21 And the @ of Benjamin came @ out of Gibeah, and
destroyed down to the ground of the @ites that day twenty and two

20:22 And the @ the men of @ encouraged @T, and set
@ battle @* in array in the @' where they put @T in
array the @O day.

20:23 (And the @ of @ went up and wept @	 the LORD
until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, @, Shall I go up @*
to battle @
 the @ of Benjamin my @X? And the LORD
said, Go up @
 him.)  20:24 And the @ of @ came near
@
 the @ of Benjamin the second day.

20:25 And Benjamin went @ @
 them out of Gibeah the second
day, and destroyed down to the ground of the @ of @ @*
eighteen @: men; all @ drew the @Q.

20:26 Then all the @ of @, and all the @, went up,
and came unto the @ of God, and wept, and sat @ @	 the

@U @&s @	 the LORD.

20:27 And the @ of @ enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of

@, Shall I yet @* go out to battle @

20:29 And @ set liers in wait round @+ Gibeah.

20:30 And the @ of @ went up @
 the @ of
Benjamin on the third day, and put @T in array @
 Gibeah,
as at @C times.

20:31 And the @ of Benjamin went out @
 the @, and
were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the @,
and kill, as at @C times, in the highways, of @ one goeth up to
the @ of God, and the @C to Gibeah in the field, @+ thirty

20:32 And the @ of Benjamin said, They are smitten down @	
us, as at the @O. But the @ of @ said, Let us flee, and
draw them from the city unto the highways.

20:33 And all the men of @ rose up out of @ @', and put
@T in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of @ came
@ out of @ @'s, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.

20:34 And @ came @
 Gibeah ten @: chosen men out of all
@, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near
them.

20:35 And the LORD smote Benjamin @	 @: and the @ of
@ destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five @:
and an @/ men: all @ drew the @Q.

20:36 So the @ of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the
men of @ gave @' to the Benjamites, @ they trusted unto
the liers in wait @ they had set beside Gibeah.

20:37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
liers in wait drew @T along, and smote all the city with the
edge of the @Q.

20:38 Now @ was an appointed sign between the men of @ and
the liers in wait, that they @# make a @ flame with smoke rise
up out of the city.

20:39 And when the men of @ retired in the battle, Benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of @ @+ thirty persons: for they
said, Surely they are smitten down @	 us, as in the @O battle.

20:40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, @%, the
flame of the city ascended up to @1.

20:41 And when the men of @ turned @*, the men of Benjamin
were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

20:42 @N they turned @ backs @	 the men of @ unto
the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them
@ came out of the @G they destroyed in the @a of them.

20:43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round @+, and chased them,
and trode them down with ease over @
 Gibeah toward the
sunrising.

20:44 And @ fell of Benjamin eighteen @: men; all @ were
men of valour.

20:45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five @: men;
and pursued hard @ them unto Gidom, and slew two @: men of
them.

20:46 So that all @ fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
@: men that drew the @Q; all @ were men of valour.

20:47 But six @/ men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

20:48 And the men of @ turned @* upon the @ of
Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the @Q, as well the men
of @ city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set
on fire all the @G that they came to.

21:1 Now the men of @ had sworn in Mizpeh, @, There @
not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

21:2 And the @ came to the @ of God, and abode @ till

21:5 And the @ of @ said, Who is @ @ all the

For they had made a @ oath concerning him that came not up to the

21:6 And the @ of @ repented them for Benjamin @
@X, and said, There is one tribe cut off from @ this day.

21:7 How @ we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to

21:9 For the @ were numbered, and, @%, @ were none of the

21:11 And this is the @7 that ye @ do, Ye @ utterly destroy

Canaan.

21:13 And the whole @` sent some to @K to the @ of
Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call @Uably unto
them.

21:14 And Benjamin came @* at that time; and they gave them wives
@ they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so
they sufficed them not.

21:15 And the @ repented them for Benjamin, @ that the LORD
had made a breach in the tribes of @.

21:16 Then the elders of the @` said, How @ we do for
wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of
Benjamin?  21:17 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them
that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
@.

21:18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
@ of @ have sworn, @, Cursed be he that giveth a wife

21:19 Then they said, @., @ is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh

21:20 @N they @M the @ of Benjamin, @, Go

21:22 And it @ be, when @ @s or @ @3 come unto

The Book of Ruth


1:1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that @
was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to
sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

1:2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued
@.

1:3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
sons.

1:4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
was Orpah, and the name of the @C Ruth: and they dwelled @
@+ ten @8.

1:5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was
left of her two sons and her husband.

1:6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she @B return
from the country of Moab: for she had @) in the country of Moab how
that the LORD had visited his @ in giving them @d.

1:7 Wherefore she went @ out of the @' where she was, and her
two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto
the land of @.

1:8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to
her m@C's @: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt
with the dead, and with me.

1:9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the @
of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up @ @;,
and wept.

1:10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
@.

1:11 And Naomi said, Turn @*, my daughters: why will ye go with me?
are @ yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your
husbands?  1:12 Turn @*, my daughters, go your way; for I am too
old to have an husband. If I @# say, I have hope, if I @# have
an husband also to night, and @# also bear sons; 1:13 Would ye
tarry for them till they were grown? @L ye stay for them from
having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your
sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out @
 me.

1:14 And they lifted up @ @;, and wept @*: and Orpah kissed
her m@C in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

1:15 And she said, @., thy sister in law is gone back unto her
@, and unto her gods: return thou @ thy sister in law.

1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following @ thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where
thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy @ @ be my @, and thy God
my God: 1:17 Where thou diest, will I die, and @ will I be buried:
the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but @^ part thee and
me.

1:18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then
she left @King unto her.

1:19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved
@+ them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  1:20 And she said unto
them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Al@By hath dealt
very bitterly with me.

1:21 I went out full and the LORD hath @ me home @* empty:
why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified @
 me,
and the Al@By hath afflicted me?  1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth
the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, @ returned out of
the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of
barley harvest.

2:1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a @By man of wealth,
of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
field, and glean ears of corn @ him in whose sight I @ find
grace.

And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

2:3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field @ the
reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging
unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

2:4 And, @%, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
The LORD be with you. And they @> him, The LORD bless thee.

2:5 Then said Boaz unto his @< that was set over the reapers,
Whose damsel is this?  2:6 And the @< that was set over the
reapers @> and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back
with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 2:7 And she said, I pray you,
let me glean and gather @ the reapers @ the sheaves: so she
came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she
tarried a little in the @.

2:8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
glean in @F field, @" go from hence, but abide here fast by
my maidens: 2:9 Let @ eyes be on the field that they do reap, and
go thou @ them: have I not charged the young men that they @
not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and
@b of that @ the young men have drawn.

2:10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and
said unto him, Why have I @V grace in @ eyes, that thou
@#est take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  2:11 And Boaz
@> and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that
thou hast done unto thy m@C in law since the @^ of @
husband: and how thou hast left thy @ and thy m@C, and the
land of thy nativity, and art come unto a @ @ thou knewest
not heretofore.

2:12 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be @= thee of
the LORD God of @, @[ whose wings thou art come to trust.

2:13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto
@ handmaid, though I be not like unto one of @ handmaidens.

2:14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of
the @d, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the
reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was
sufficed, and left.

2:15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz @M his young men,
@, Let her glean even @ the sheaves, and reproach her not:
2:16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

2:17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
gleaned: and it was @+ an ephah of barley.

2:18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her m@C in law
saw what she had gleaned: and she @ @, and gave to her that
she had reserved @ she was sufficed.

2:19 And her m@C in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to
day?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge
of thee. And she shewed her m@C in law with whom she had wrought,
and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.

2:20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the
dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of
our next kinsmen.

2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou @
keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

2:22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not
in any @C field.

2:23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her m@C in law.

3:1 Then Naomi her m@C in law said unto her, My daughter, @ I
not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?  3:2 And now is
not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  @., he
winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

3:3 Wash thyself @fore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto
the man, until he @ have done eating and @bing.

3:4 And it @ be, when he lieth down, that thou @ mark the
@' where he @ lie, and thou @ go in, and uncover his feet,
and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou @ do.

3:5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

3:6 And she went down unto the floor, and did @$ to all that
her m@C in law bade her.

3:7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his @ was merry, he
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly,
and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

3:8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
turned @9: and, @%, a woman lay at his feet.

3:9 And he said, Who art thou? And she @>, I am Ruth @
handmaid: spread @fore thy skirt over @ handmaid; for thou art
a near kinsman.

3:10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou
hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.

3:11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
requirest: for all the city of my @ doth know that thou art a
virtuous woman.

3:12 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit @ is a
kinsman nearer than I.

3:13 Tarry this night, and it @ be in the morning, that if he will
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the
kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,
then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie
down until the morning.

3:14 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up @	
one could know @F. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman
came into the floor.

3:15 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold
it.

And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it
on her: and she went into the city.

3:16 And when she came to her m@C in law, she said, Who art thou,
my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.

3:17 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
said to me, Go not empty unto thy m@C in law.

3:18 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have
finished the @7 this day.

4:1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down @: and,
@%, the kinsman of whom Boaz @0 came by; unto whom he said, Ho,
such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat
down.

4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye
down here. And they sat down.

4:3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come @* out of the
country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, @ was our @X
Elimelech's: 4:4 And I thought to advertise thee, @, Buy it
@	 the inhabitants, and @	 the elders of my @. If thou
wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell
me, that I may know: for @ is none to redeem it beside thee; and I
am @ thee. And he said, I will redeem it.

4:5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the
dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.

4:6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar
mine own inheritance: redeem thou my @c to thyself; for I cannot
redeem it.

4:7 Now this was the manner in former time in @ concerning
redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all @; a man
plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a
testimony in @.

4:8 @N the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew
off his shoe.

4:9 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the @, Ye are
witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and
all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

4:10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
that the name of the dead be not cut off from @ his @3, and
from the gate of his @': ye are witnesses this day.

4:11 And all the @ that were in the gate, and the elders, said,
We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into @
@ like Rachel and like Leah, @ two did build the @ of
@: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
4:12 And let thy @ be like the @ of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
unto @, of the seed @ the LORD @ give thee of this young
woman.

4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto
her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

4:14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, @ hath
not left thee this day @S a kinsman, that his name may be famous
in @.

4:15 And he @ be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
of @ old age: for thy daughter in law, @ loveth thee, @ is
better to thee than @H sons, hath born him.

4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
nurse unto it.

4:17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, @, There is a
son born to Naomi; and they @, his name Obed: he is the @ of
Jesse, the @ of @.

4:18 Now @ are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
4:19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab
begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 4:21 And Salmon begat Boaz,
and Boaz begat Obed, 4:22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat @.




The First Book of Samuel

Otherwise Called:

The First Book of the Kings


1:1 Now @ was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the
son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 1:2 And he had two wives;
the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the @C Peninnah:
and Peninnah had @, but Hannah had no @.

1:3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, the @6s of the LORD, were @.

1:4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 1:5 But
unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the
LORD had shut up her womb.

1:6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
@ the LORD had shut up her womb.

1:7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the @ of
the LORD, so she provoked her; @fore she wept, and did not eat.

1:8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
and why eatest thou not? and why is thy @ grieved? am not I better
to thee than ten sons?  1:9 So Hannah rose up @ they had eaten in
Shiloh, and @ they had drunk. Now Eli the @6 sat upon a seat
by a post of the temple of the LORD.

1:10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and
wept sore.

1:11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of @ handmaid, and remember me, and
not forget @ handmaid, but wilt give unto @ handmaid a man
child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,
and @ @ no razor come upon his head.

1:12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying @	 the LORD,
that Eli marked her @P.

1:13 Now Hannah, she @0 in her @; only her lips moved, but her
@; was not @): @fore Eli thought she had been drunken.

1:14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
thy wine from thee.

1:15 And Hannah @> and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
sorrowful spirit: I have drunk @" wine nor strong @b, but have
poured out my soul @	 the LORD.

1:16 Count not @ handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

1:17 Then Eli @> and said, Go in @U: and the God of @
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

1:18 And she said, Let @ handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

1:19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped @	 the
LORD, and returned, and came to @ @ to Ramah: and Elkanah knew
Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come @+ @
Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and @, his name Samuel,
@, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

1:21 And the man Elkanah, and all his @, went up to offer unto the
LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

1:22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not
go up until the child be weaned, and then I will @( him, that he
may appear @	 the LORD, and @ abide for ever.

1:23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So
the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

1:24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with @@
bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and @
him unto the @ of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.

1:25 And they slew a bullock, and @ the child to Eli.

1:26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

1:27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath @= me my petition
@ I asked of him: 1:28 @N also I have lent him to the LORD;
as long as he liveth he @ be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped
the LORD @.

2:1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My @ rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
horn is exalted in the LORD: my @P is enlarged over mine enemies;
@ I rejoice in thy salvation.

2:2 There is none holy as the LORD: for @ is none beside thee:
@" is @ any rock like our God.

2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of
your @P: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
weighed.

2:4 The bows of the @By men are broken, and they that stumbled are
girded with strength.

2:5 They that were full have hired out @T for @d; and they
that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born @H; and she
that hath many @ is waxed feeble.

2:6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he @(eth down to the grave,
and @(eth up.

2:7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he @(eth low, and
lifteth up.

2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghill, to set them @ princes, and to make them inherit
the throne of @Y: for the pillars of the @ are the LORD's, and
he hath set the world upon them.

2:9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked @ be
silent in darkness; for by strength @ no man prevail.

2:10 The adversaries of the LORD @ be broken to pieces; out of
@1 @ he th@[ upon them: the LORD @ judge the ends of
the @; and he @ give strength unto his king, and exalt the
horn of his anointed.

2:11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his @. And the child did
minister unto the LORD @	 Eli the @6.

2:12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

2:13 And the @6's custom with the @ was, that, when any man
offered sacrifice, the @6's @< came, while the @R was in
see@7, with a @Rhook of @@ teeth in his hand; 2:14 And he
struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the
@Rhook @ up the @6 took for @9. So they did in
Shiloh unto all the @ites that came thither.

2:15 Also @	 they @_ the fat, the @6's @< came, and
said to the man that sacrificed, Give @R to roast for the @6;
for he will not have sodden @R of thee, but raw.

2:16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he @L
answer him, Nay; but thou @ give it me now: and if not, I will
take it by force.

2:17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very @ @	 the
LORD: for men abhorred the @& of the LORD.

2:18 But Samuel ministered @	 the LORD, being a child, girded with
a linen ephod.

2:19 Moreover his m@C made him a little coat, and @ it to him
from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice.

2:20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
thee seed of this woman for the loan @ is lent to the LORD. And
they went unto @ own home.

2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
@@ sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew @	 the
LORD.

2:22 Now Eli was very old, and @) all that his sons did unto all
@; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the @`.

2:23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such @? for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this @.

2:24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
LORD's @ to transgress.

2:25 If one man sin @
 @F, the judge @ judge him: but if
a man sin @
 the LORD, who @ intreat for him? Notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto the @; of @ @, @ the LORD

2:26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the

2:27 And @ came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
@
 the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the @ of thy @,

3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD @	 Eli. And the
word of the LORD was precious in @J days; @ was no open vision.

3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
@', and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; 3:3 And
ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark
of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 3:4 That the LORD
@, Samuel: and he @>, Here am I.

3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou @,st me.
And he said, I @, not; lie down @*. And he went and lay down.

3:6 And the LORD @, yet @*, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he @>,
I @, not, my son; lie down @*.

3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, @" was the word of the
LORD yet revealed unto him.

3:8 And the LORD @, Samuel @* the third time. And he arose and
went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
perceived that the LORD had @, the child.

3:9 @N Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it @ be, if
he call thee, that thou @ say, Speak, LORD; for thy @<
heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his @'.

3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and @, as at @C times,
Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel @>, Speak; for thy @< heareth.

3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, @., I will do a @7 in @,
at @ both the ears of @ one that heareth it @ tingle.

3:12 In that day I will perform @
 Eli all @ @ I have
spoken concerning his @: when I begin, I will also make an end.

3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his @ for ever for the
iniquity @ he knoweth; @ his sons made @T vile, and
he restrained them not.

3:14 And @fore I have sworn unto the @ of Eli, that the
iniquity of Eli's @ @ not be purged with sacrifice nor
@& for ever.

3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
@ of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

3:16 Then Eli @, Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
@>, Here am I.

3:17 And he said, What is the @7 that the LORD hath said unto thee?
I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if
thou hide any @7 from me of all the @ that he said unto thee.

3:18 And Samuel told him @ whit, and hid no@7 from him. And he
said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
his @5 fall to the ground.

3:20 And all @ from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
established to be a prophet of the LORD.

3:21 And the LORD appeared @* in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
@9 to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all @. Now @ went out
@
 the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and
the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

4:2 And the Philistines put @T in array @
 @: and
when they joined battle, @ was smitten @	 the Philistines:
and they slew of the army in the field @+ four @: men.

4:3 And when the @ were come into the camp, the elders of @
said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day @	 the
Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of
Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh @ us, it may save us out of
the hand of our enemies.

4:4 So the @ sent to Shiloh, that they @B @( from thence
the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, @ dwelleth between
the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were
@ with the ark of the covenant of God.

4:5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
all @ shouted with a @ shout, so that the @ rang @*.

4:6 And when the Philistines @) the noise of the shout, they said,
What meaneth the noise of this @ shout in the camp of the Hebrews?
And they @[stood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.

4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into
the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for @ hath not been such a
@7 heretofore.

4:8 Woe unto us! who @ deliver us out of the hand of @ @By
Gods? @ are the Gods that smote the @-ians with all the plagues
in the wilderness.

4:9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye
be not @<s unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit
yourselves like men, and fight.

4:10 And the Philistines fought, and @ was smitten, and they fled
@ man into his tent: and @ was a very @ slaughter; for
@ fell of @ thirty @: footmen.

4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were slain.

4:12 And @ ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with @ upon his
head.

4:13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
watching: for his @ trembled for the ark of God. And when the man
came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.

4:14 And when Eli @) the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.

4:15 Now Eli was ninety and eight @8 old; and his eyes were dim,
that he could not see.

4:16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and
I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is @ done, my
son?  4:17 And the messenger @> and said, @ is fled @	
the Philistines, and @ hath been also a @ slaughter @ the
@, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the
ark of God is taken.

4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his
neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had
judged @ forty @8.

4:19 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to
be delivered: and when she @) the tidings that the ark of God was
taken, and that her @ in law and her husband were dead, she bowed
herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.

4:20 And @+ the time of her @^ the women that stood by her said
unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she @> not,
@" did she regard it.

4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, @, The @Y is departed
from @: @ the ark of God was taken, and @ of her
@ in law and her husband.

4:22 And she said, The @Y is departed from @: for the ark of
God is taken.

5:1 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and @ it from
Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

5:2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they @ it into the
@ of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

5:3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, @%, Dagon
was fallen upon his face to the @ @	 the ark of the LORD. And
they took Dagon, and set him in his @' @*.

5:4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, @%, Dagon was
fallen upon his face to the ground @	 the ark of the LORD; and the
head of Dagon and both the palms of his @D were cut off upon the
threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.

5:5 @N @" the @6s of Dagon, nor any that come into
Dagon's @, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this
day.

5:6 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the
coasts @of.

5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
of the God of @ @ not abide with us: for his hand is sore
upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

5:8 They sent @fore and ga@d all the lords of the Philistines
unto them, and said, What @ we do with the ark of the God of
@? And they @>, Let the ark of the God of @ be carried
@+ unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of @ @+
thither.

5:9 And it was so, that, @ they had carried it @+, the hand of
the LORD was @
 the city with a very @ destruction: and he
smote the men of the city, both small and @, and they had emerods
in @ secret parts.

5:10 @N they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, @,
They have @ @+ the ark of the God of @ to us, to slay us
and our @.

5:11 So they sent and ga@d @? all the lords of the
Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of @, and let
it go @* to his own @', that it slay us not, and our @: for
@ was a deadly destruction @Eout all the city; the hand of
God was very heavy @.

5:12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the
cry of the city went up to @1.

6:1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
@H months.

6:2 And the Philistines @, for the @6s and the diviners,
@, What @ we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we
@ send it to his @'.

6:3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of @, send
it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass @&: then ye
@ be healed, and it @ be known to you why his hand is not
removed from you.

6:4 Then said they, What @ be the trespass @& @ we @
return to him? They @>, Five golden emerods, and five golden
mice, @$ to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one
plague was on you all, and on your lords.

6:5 Wherefore ye @ make images of your emerods, and images of your
mice that mar the land; and ye @ give @Y unto the God of
@: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from
off your gods, and from off your land.

6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden your @s, as the @-ians and
Pharaoh hardened @ @s? when he had wrought wonderfully @
them, did they not let the @ go, and they departed?  6:7 Now
@fore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on @ @
hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and @( @
calves home from them: 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it
upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, @ ye return him for a
trespass @&, in a coffer by the side @of; and send it away,
that it may go.

6:9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this @ evil: but if not, then we
@ know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that
happened to us.

6:10 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
cart, and shut up @ calves at home: 6:11 And they laid the ark of
the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the
images of @ emerods.

6:12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to
the @c hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went
@ them unto the border of Bethshemesh.

6:13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping @ wheat harvest in the
valley: and they lifted up @ eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced
to see it.

6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
stood @, where @ was a @ stone: and they clave the wood of
the cart, and offered the kine a @_ @& unto the LORD.

6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the
@ stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered @_ @&s and
sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.

6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
returned to Ekron the same day.

6:17 And @ are the golden emerods @ the Philistines returned
for a trespass @& unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden
mice, @$ to the number of all the @G of the Philistines
belonging to the five lords, both of fenced @G, and of country
villages, even unto the @ stone of Abel, whereon they set down the
ark of the LORD: @ stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
Joshua, the Bethshemite.

6:19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, @ they had looked into
the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the @ fifty @: and
@@score and ten men: and the @ lamented, @ the LORD had
smitten many of the @ with a @ slaughter.

6:20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand @	 this
holy LORD God? and to whom @ he go up from us?  6:21 And they sent
messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, @, The
Philistines have @ @* the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and
fetch it up to you.

7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
LORD, and @ it into the @ of Abinadab in the hill, and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.

7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
the time was long; for it was twenty @8: and all the @ of
@ lamented @ the LORD.

7:3 And Samuel @0 unto all the @ of @, @, If ye do
return unto the LORD with all your @s, then put away the strange
gods and Ashtaroth from @ you, and prepare your @s unto the
LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of
the Philistines.

7:4 Then the @ of @ did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
served the LORD only.

7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all @ to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
you unto the LORD.

7:6 And they ga@d @? to Mizpeh, and drew @Z, and poured
it out @	 the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said @, We
have sinned @
 the LORD. And Samuel judged the @ of @
in Mizpeh.

7:7 And when the Philistines @) that the @ of @ were
ga@d @? to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up
@
 @. And when the @ of @ @) it, they were
afraid of the Philistines.

7:8 And the @ of @ said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.

7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a @_
@& wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for
@; and the LORD @) him.

7:10 And as Samuel was @& up the @_ @&, the Philistines
drew near to battle @
 @: but the LORD th@[ed with a
@ th@[ on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them;
and they were smitten @	 @.

7:11 And the men of @ went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
Philistines, and smote them, until they came @[ Bethcar.

7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
@, the name of it Ebenezer, @, Hitherto hath the LORD helped
us.

7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
coast of @: and the hand of the LORD was @
 the Philistines
all the days of Samuel.

7:14 And the @G @ the Philistines had taken from @ were
restored to @, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts @of
did @ deliver out of the @D of the Philistines. And @ was
@U between @ and the Amorites.

7:15 And Samuel judged @ all the days of his life.

7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
and Mizpeh, and judged @ in all @J @'s.

7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for @ was his @; and @
he judged @; and @ he built an @\ unto the LORD.

8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
judges over @.

8:2 Now the name of his @Oborn was Joel; and the name of his
second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside @ lucre,
and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

8:4 Then all the elders of @ ga@d @T @?, and
came to Samuel unto Ramah, 8:5 And said unto him, @., thou art
old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us
like all the nations.

8:6 But the @7 displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the @; of the
@ in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me, that I @# not reign over them.

8:8 According to all the works @ they have done since the day that
I @ them up out of @- even unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served @C gods, so do they also unto thee.

8:9 Now @fore hearken unto @ @;: howbeit yet protest
solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that @
reign over them.

8:10 And Samuel told all the @5 of the LORD unto the @ that
asked of him a king.

8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that @ reign
over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for @9, for
his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some @ run @	 his
chariots.

8:12 And he will appoint him captains over @:s, and captains
over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his
harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his
chariots.

8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
cooks, and to be bakers.

8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his @<s.

8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
and give to his officers, and to his @<s.

8:16 And he will take your men@<s, and your maid@<s, and
your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye @ be his
@<s.

8:18 And ye @ cry out in that day @ of your king @ ye
@ have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

8:19 Nevertheless the @ refused to obey the @; of Samuel; and
they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 8:20 That we also may
be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out
@	 us, and fight our battles.

8:21 And Samuel @) all the @5 of the @, and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the LORD.

8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto @ @;, and make
them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of @, Go ye @ man
unto his city.

9:1 Now @ was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
Benjamite, a @By man of power.

9:2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
goodly: and @ was not @ the @ of @ a goodlier
person than he: from his @#ers and upward he was higher than any

9:3 And the asses of Kish Saul's @ were lost. And Kish said to
Saul his son, Take now one of the @<s with thee, and arise, go
seek the asses.

9:4 And he passed @E mount Ephraim, and passed @E the land
of Shalisha, but they @V them not: then they passed @E the
land of Shalim, and @ they were not: and he passed @E the
land of the Benjamites, but they @V them not.

9:5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
@< that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my @
leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

9:6 And he said unto him, @. now, @ is in this city a man of
God, and he is an honourable man; all that he @
 cometh surely to
pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that
we @# go.

9:7 Then said Saul to his @<, But, @%, if we go, what @

not a present to @( to the man of God: what have we?  9:8 And the
@< @> Saul @*, and said, @., I have here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God,

9:9 (Beforetime in @, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
@0, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now @, a
Prophet was @	time @, a Seer.)  9:10 Then said Saul to his
@<, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where
the man of God was.

9:11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they @V young
maidens going out to draw @Z, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
9:12 And they @> them, and said, He is; @%, he is @

@ he doth bless the sacrifice; and @wards they eat that be

9:14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the

9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day @	 Saul came,
@, 9:16 To morrow @+ this time I will send thee a man out of

9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, @. the man
whom I @0 to thee of! this same @ reign over my @.

9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
pray thee, where the seer's @ is.

9:19 And Samuel @> Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up @

I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in @ @.

9:20 And as for @ asses that were lost @@ days ago, set not thy

Saul @> and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the

Samuel took Saul and his @<, and @ them into the parlour,
and made them sit in the chiefest @' @ them that were bidden,
@ were @+ thirty persons.

9:23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion @ I gave

9:24 And the cook took up the @#er, and that @ was upon it,

Samuel that day.

9:25 And when they were come down from the high @' into the city,
Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the @.

9:26 And they arose early: and it came to pass @+ the spring of the
day, that Samuel @, Saul to the top of the @, @, Up, that
I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
he and Samuel, abroad.

9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
to Saul, Bid the @< pass on @	 us, (and he passed on), but
stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, Is it not @ the LORD hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance?  10:2 When thou art departed from me
to day, then thou @ find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the
border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses
@ thou wentest to seek are @V: and, lo, thy @ hath left
the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, @, What @ I do
for my son?  10:3 Then @ thou go on forward from thence, and thou
@ come to the plain of Tabor, and @ @ meet thee @@ men

carrying @@ loaves of @d, and @F carrying a bottle of wine:
10:4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of @d;
@ thou @ receive of @ @D.

10:5 After that thou @ come to the hill of God, where is the
garrison of the Philistines: and it @ come to pass, when thou art
come thither to the city, that thou @ meet a company of prophets
coming down from the high @' with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a

10:7 And let it be, when @ signs are come unto thee, that thou do

10:8 And thou @ go down @	 me to Gilgal; and, @%, I will

10:9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
Samuel, God gave him @F @: and all @J signs came to pass
that day.

10:10 And when they came thither to the hill, @%, a company of
prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
prophesied @ them.

10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him @	time saw that,
@%, he prophesied @ the prophets, then the @ said one to
@F, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
@ the prophets?  10:12 And one of the same @' @> and
said, But who is @ @? @N it became a proverb, Is Saul
also @ the prophets?  10:13 And when he had made an end of
prophesying, he came to the high @'.

10:14 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his @<, Whither went
ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no
where, we came to Samuel.

10:15 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
unto you.

10:16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses
were @V. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel @0, he
told him not.

10:17 And Samuel @, the @ @? unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
10:18 And said unto the @ of @, Thus @
 the LORD God of
@, I @ up @ out of @-, and delivered you out of the
hand of the @-ians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of
them that oppressed you: 10:19 And ye have this day rejected your God,
who @9 saved you out of all your adversities and your
tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.
Now @fore present yourselves @	 the LORD by your tribes, and
by your @:s.

10:20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of @ to come
near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

10:21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by @
families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was
taken: and when they sought him, he could not be @V.

10:22 @N they enquired of the LORD further, if the man @#

@ the stuff.

10:23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood @ the
@, he was higher than any of the @ from his @#ers and
upward.

10:24 And Samuel said to all the @, See ye him whom the LORD hath
chosen, that @ is none like him @ all the @? And all the
@ shouted, and said, God save the king.

10:25 Then Samuel told the @ the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
it in a book, and laid it up @	 the LORD. And Samuel sent all the
@ away, @ man to his @.

10:26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and @ went with him a
band of men, whose @s God had touched.

10:27 But the @ of Belial said, How @ this man save us? And
they despised him, and @ no presents. But he held his @U.

11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped @

Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a
covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite @> them, On this condition will I
make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your @c eyes,
and lay it for a reproach upon all @.

11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us @H days'
respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of @:
and then, if @ be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
in the ears of the @: and all the @ lifted up @ @;s,
and wept.

11:5 And, @%, Saul came @ the herd out of the field; and Saul
said, What aileth the @ that they weep? And they told him the
tidings of the men of Jabesh.

11:6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he @) @J tidings,
and his anger was kindled @ly.

11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
them @Eout all the coasts of @ by the @D of messengers,
@, Whosoever cometh not @ @ Saul and @ Samuel, so
@ it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the
@, and they came out with one consent.

11:8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the @ of @ were
@@ @/ @:, and the men of @ thirty @:.

11:9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus @ ye say
unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot,

of Jabesh; and they were glad.

11:10 @N the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
unto you, and ye @ do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

11:11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the @ in @@
companies; and they came into the @a of the host in the morning
watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came
to pass, that they @ remained were scattered, so that two of them
were not left @?.

11:12 And the @ said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
reign over us? @( the men, that we may put them to @^.

11:13 And Saul said, There @ not a man be put to @^ this day:
for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in @.

11:14 Then said Samuel to the @, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
and renew the kingdom @.

11:15 And all the @ went to Gilgal; and @ they made Saul king
@	 the LORD in Gilgal; and @ they sacrificed sacrifices of
@U @&s @	 the LORD; and @ Saul and all the men of
@ rejoiced @ly.

12:1 And Samuel said unto all @, @., I have hearkened unto

12:2 And now, @%, the king walketh @	 you: and I am old and
grayheaded; and, @%, my sons are with you: and I have walked
@	 you from my childhood unto this day.

12:3 @., here I am: witness @

his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or
whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I
received any bribe to blind mine eyes @with? and I will restore it
you.

12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
@" hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

12:5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness @
 you, and his
anointed is witness this day, that ye have not @V ought in my hand.
And they @>, He is witness.

12:6 And Samuel said unto the @, It is the LORD that advanced
@ and Aaron, and that @ your @s up out of the land of
@-.

12:7 Now @fore stand still, that I may reason with you @	 the
LORD of all the @ceous acts of the LORD, @ he did to you and to

12:8 When @] was come into @-, and your @s cried unto the

12:9 And when they forgat the LORD @ God, he sold them into the
hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought
@
 them.

12:10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, @
we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but
now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on @
side, and ye dwelled safe.

12:12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the @ of Ammon

12:13 Now @fore @% the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye

12:14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his @;, and

 the commandment of the LORD, then @ both ye and

12:16 Now @fore stand and see this @ @7, @ the LORD

12:17 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
he @ send th@[ and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your

12:18 So Samuel @, unto the LORD; and the LORD sent th@[ and
rain that day: and all the @ @ly feared the LORD and Samuel.

12:19 And all the @ said unto Samuel, Pray for thy @<s unto
the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins
this evil, to ask us a king.

12:20 And Samuel said unto the @, Fear not: ye have done all this
wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the
LORD with all your @; 12:21 And turn ye not aside: for then @#
ye go @ vain @, @ cannot profit nor deliver; for they are

12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his @ for his @ name's

12:23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I @# sin @

12:25 But if ye @ still do wickedly, ye @ be consumed, both ye

13:1 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two @8 over
@, 13:2 Saul chose him @@ @: men of @; whereof two
@: were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
@: were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the
@ he sent @ man to his tent.

13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
Geba, and the Philistines @) of it. And Saul blew the trumpet
@Eout all the land, @, Let the Hebrews hear.

13:4 And all @ @) say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
Philistines, and that @ also was had in abomination with the
Philistines. And the @ were @, @? @ Saul to Gilgal.

13:5 And the Philistines ga@d @T @? to fight with
@, thirty @: chariots, and six @: horsemen, and
@ as the sand @ is on the sea shore in multitude: and they
came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.

13:6 When the men of @ saw that they were in a strait, (for the
@ were distressed,) then the @ did hide @T in caves,
and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high @'s, and in pits.

13:7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the @ followed
him trembling.

13:8 And he tarried @H days, @$ to the set time that Samuel
had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the @ were
scattered from him.

13:9 And Saul said, Bring hither a @_ @& to me, and @U
@&s. And he offered the @_ @&.

13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
@& the @_ @&, @%, Samuel came; and Saul went out to
meet him, that he @B salute him.

13:11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
saw that the @ were scattered from me, and that thou camest not
within the days appointed, and that the Philistines ga@d
@T @? at Michmash; 13:12 @N said I, The
Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made
supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself @fore, and offered a
@_ @&.

13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, @ he @M thee: for
now @L the LORD have established thy kingdom upon @ for ever.

13:14 But now thy kingdom @ not continue: the LORD hath sought him
a man @ his own @, and the LORD hath @M him to be
captain over his @, @ thou hast not kept that @ the
LORD @M thee.

13:15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
Benjamin. And Saul numbered the @ that were present with him,
@+ six @/ men.

13:16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the @ that were present
with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped
in Michmash.

13:17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
@@ companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to
Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 13:18 And @F company turned the
way to Bethhoron: and @F company turned to the way of the border
that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

13:19 Now @ was no smith @V @Eout all the land of @:
for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them @Qs or spears:
13:20 But all the @ites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
@ man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

13:21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and
for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

13:22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that @ was @"
@Q nor spear @V in the hand of any of the @ that were with
Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was @
@V.

13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
Michmash.

14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over
to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the @C side. But he told
not his @.

14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah @[ a
pomegranate tree @ is in Migron: and the @ that were with him
were @+ six @/ men; 14:3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,
Ichabod's @X, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's
@6 in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the @ knew not that
Jonathan was gone.

14:4 And between the passages, by @ Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines' garrison, @ was a sharp rock on the one
side, and a sharp rock on the @C side: and the name of the one was
Bozez, and the name of the @C Seneh.

14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over @

Michmash, and the @C southward over @
 Gibeah.

14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
and let us go over unto the garrison of @ uncircumcised: it may be
that the LORD will work for us: for @ is no restraint to the LORD
to save by many or by few.

14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in @
@: turn thee; @%, I am with thee @$ to thy @.

14:8 Then said Jonathan, @., we will pass over unto @ men, and
we will discover ourselves unto them.

14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
will stand still in our @', and will not go up unto them.

14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this @ be a sign
unto us.

14:11 And both of them discovered @T unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said, @., the Hebrews come @
out of the holes where they had hid @T.

14:12 And the men of the garrison @> Jonathan and his
armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a @7.
And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up @ me: for the
LORD hath delivered them into the hand of @.

14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his @D and upon his feet, and
his armourbearer @ him: and they fell @	 Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew @ him.

14:14 And that @O slaughter, @ Jonathan and his armourbearer
made, was @+ twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,
@ a yoke of oxen @B plow.

14:15 And @ was trembling in the host, in the field, and @ all
the @: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and
the @ quaked: so it was a very @ trembling.

14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
@%, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one
@F.

14:17 Then said Saul unto the @ that were with him, Number now,
and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, @%,
Jonathan and his armourbearer were not @.

14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
ark of God was at that time with the @ of @.

14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the @6, that the
noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:
and Saul said unto the @6, Withdraw @ hand.

14:20 And Saul and all the @ that were with him assembled
@T, and they came to the battle: and, @%, @ man's
@Q was @
 his fellow, and @ was a very @ discomfiture.

14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines @	 that
time, @ went up with them into the camp from the country round
@+, even they also turned to be with the @ites that were with
Saul and Jonathan.

14:22 Likewise all the men of @ @ had hid @T in mount
Ephraim, when they @) that the Philistines fled, even they also
followed hard @ them in the battle.

14:23 So the LORD saved @ that day: and the battle passed over
unto Bethaven.

14:24 And the men of @ were distressed that day: for Saul had
adjured the @, @, Cursed be the man that eateth any food
until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the
@ tasted any food.

14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and @ was honey
upon the ground.

14:26 And when the @ were come into the wood, @%, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand to his @P: for the @ feared
the oath.

14:27 But Jonathan @) not when his @ charged the @ with
the oath: wherefore he put @ the end of the rod that was in his
hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his @P;
and his eyes were enlightened.

14:28 Then @> one of the @, and said, Thy @ straitly
charged the @ with an oath, @, Cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day. And the @ were faint.

14:29 Then said Jonathan, My @ hath troubled the land: see, I
pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, @ I tasted a
little of this honey.

14:30 How much more, if haply the @ had eaten freely to day of
the spoil of @ enemies @ they @V? for had @ not been
now a much @er slaughter @ the Philistines?  14:31 And they
smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the
@ were very faint.

14:32 And the @ flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the @ did eat them
with the @I.

14:33 Then they told Saul, @, @., the @ sin @
 the
LORD, in that they eat with the @I. And he said, Ye have
transgressed: roll a @ stone unto me this day.

14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves @ the @, and say
unto them, Bring me hither @ man his ox, and @ man his sheep,
and slay them here, and eat; and sin not @
 the LORD in eating
with the @I.

And all the @ @ @ man his ox with him that night, and
slew them @.

14:35 And Saul built an @\ unto the LORD: the same was the @O
@\ that he built unto the LORD.

14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down @ the Philistines by night,
and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of
them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said
the @6, Let us draw near hither unto God.

14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down @ the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of @? But he
@> him not that day.

14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the @:
and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, @ saveth @, though it be in
Jonathan my son, he @ surely die. But @ was not a man @
all the @ that @> him.

14:40 Then said he unto all @, Be ye on one side, and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the @C side. And the @ said unto
Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

14:41 @N Saul said unto the LORD God of @, Give a perfect
lot.

And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the @ escaped.

14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
Jonathan was taken.

14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the
end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.

14:44 And Saul @>, God do so and more also: for thou @
surely die, Jonathan.

14:45 And the @ said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this @ salvation in @? God forbid: as the LORD
liveth, @ @ not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for
he hath wrought with God this day. So the @ rescued Jonathan,
that he died not.

14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
Philistines went to @ own @'.

14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over @, and fought @
 all his
enemies on @ side, @
 Moab, and @
 the @ of
Ammon, and @
 Edom, and @
 the kings of Zobah, and @

the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned @9, he vexed them.

14:48 And he ga@d an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
@ out of the @D of them that spoiled them.

14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
and the names of his two daughters were @; the name of the
@Oborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 14:50 And the
name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name
of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

14:51 And Kish was the @ of Saul; and Ner the @ of Abner was
the son of Abiel.

14:52 And @ was sore war @
 the Philistines all the days of
Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took
him unto him.

15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
king over his @, over @: now @fore hearken thou unto the
@; of the @5 of the LORD.

15:2 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, I remember that @ Amalek did to
@, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from
@-.

15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass.

15:4 And Saul ga@d the @ @?, and numbered them in
Telaim, two @/ @: footmen, and ten @: men of @.

15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
@ the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed
kindness to all the @ of @, when they came up out of
@-. So the Kenites departed from @ the Amalekites.

15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
Shur, that is over @
 @-.

15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the @ with the edge of the @Q.

15:9 But Saul and the @ spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was
good, and @L not utterly destroy them: but @ @7 that was
vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, @, 15:11 It
repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back
from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it
grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.

15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
told Samuel, @, Saul came to Carmel, and, @%, he set him up a
@', and is gone @+, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.

15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen @ I hear?  15:15 And Saul
said, They have @ them from the Amalekites: for the @
spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the
LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

15:17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in @ own sight, wast
thou not made the head of the tribes of @, and the LORD anointed
thee king over @?  15:18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and
said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight
@
 them until they be consumed.

15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the @; of the LORD, but
didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the @; of the
LORD, and have gone the way @ the LORD sent me, and have @
Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

15:21 But the @ took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
the @ @ @# have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto
the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as @ delight in @_
@&s and sacrifices, as in obeying the @; of the LORD? @.,
to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the
LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy @5: @ I
feared the @, and obeyed @ @;.

15:25 Now @fore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn @* with
me, that I may worship the LORD.

15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee
from being king over @.

15:27 And as Samuel turned @+ to go away, he laid hold upon the
skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
@ from thee this day, and hath @= it to a neighbour of @,
that is better than thou.

15:29 And also the Strength of @ will not lie nor repent: for he
is not a man, that he @# repent.

15:30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
@	 the elders of my @, and @	 @, and turn @* with
me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

15:31 So Samuel turned @* @ Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

15:32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of @^ is past.

15:33 And Samuel said, As the @Q hath made women childless, so
@ thy m@C be childless @ women. And Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces @	 the LORD in Gilgal.

15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his @ to
Gibeah of Saul.

15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his @^:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he
had made Saul king over @.

16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over @? fill @ horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I
have provided me a king @ his sons.

16:2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to
sacrifice to the LORD.

16:3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou
@ do: and thou @ anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.

16:4 And Samuel did that @ the LORD @0, and came to Bethlehem.
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest
thou @Uably?  16:5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice
unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.
And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and @, them to the
sacrifice.

16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is @	 him.

16:7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
the height of his stature; @ I have refused him: for the LORD
seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but
the LORD looketh on the @.

16:8 Then Jesse @, Abinadab, and made him pass @	 Samuel. And
he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
LORD chosen this.

16:10 Again, Jesse made @H of his sons to pass @	 Samuel. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen @.

16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy @? And he
said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, @%, he keepeth the
sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not
sit down till he come hither.

16:12 And he sent, and @ him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of
a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,
Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the @a
of his @3: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon @ from that
day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
spirit from the LORD troubled him.

16:15 And Saul's @<s said unto him, @. now, an evil spirit
from God troubleth thee.

16:16 Let our lord now command thy @<s, @ are @	 thee, to
seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it @ come
to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he @
play with his hand, and thou @ be well.

16:17 And Saul said unto his @<s, Provide me now a man that can
play well, and @( him to me.

16:18 Then @> one of the @<s, and said, @., I have seen
a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a
@By valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a
comely person, and the LORD is with him.

16:19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
@ thy son, @ is with the sheep.

16:20 And Jesse took an ass laden with @d, and a bottle of wine,
and a kid, and sent them by @ his son unto Saul.

16:21 And @ came to Saul, and stood @	 him: and he loved him
@ly; and he became his armourbearer.

16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, @, Let @, I pray thee, stand
@	 me; for he hath @V favour in my sight.

16:23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
Saul, that @ took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was
refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

17:1 Now the Philistines ga@d @? @ armies to battle, and
were ga@d @? at Shochoh, @ belongeth to @, and
pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

17:2 And Saul and the men of @ were ga@d @?, and
pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array @
 the
Philistines.

17:3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
@ stood on a mountain on the @C side: and @ was a valley
between them.

17:4 And @ went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

17:5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five @:
shekels of brass.

17:6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
between his @#ers.

17:7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
spear's head weighed six @/ shekels of iron: and one bearing a
shield went @	 him.

17:8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of @, and said unto
them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a
Philistine, and ye @<s to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let
him come down to me.

17:9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be
your @<s: but if I prevail @
 him, and kill him, then @
ye be our @<s, and serve us.

17:10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of @ this day;
give me a man, that we may fight @?.

17:11 When Saul and all @ @) @J @5 of the Philistine,
they were dismayed, and @ly afraid.

17:12 Now @ was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went @
men for an old man in the days of Saul.

17:13 And the @@ eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
battle: and the names of his @@ sons that went to the battle were
Eliab the @Oborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third
Shammah.

17:14 And @ was the youngest: and the @@ eldest followed Saul.

17:15 But @ went and returned from Saul to feed his @'s sheep
at Bethlehem.

17:16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
@9 forty days.

17:17 And Jesse said unto @ his son, Take now for thy @3 an
ephah of this parched corn, and @ ten loaves, and run to the camp
of thy @3; 17:18 And carry @ ten cheeses unto the captain of
@ @:, and look how thy @3 fare, and take @ pledge.

17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of @, were in the
valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

17:20 And @ rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had @M him; and he came
to the trench, as the host was going @ to the fight, and shouted
for the battle.

17:21 For @ and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
@
 army.

17:22 And @ left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his @3.

17:23 And as he talked with them, @%, @ came up the champion,
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and @0 @$ to the same @5: and @ @)
them.

17:24 And all the men of @, when they saw the man, fled from him,
and were sore afraid.

17:25 And the men of @ said, Have ye seen this man that is come
up?  surely to defy @ is he come up: and it @ be, that the
man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with @ riches, and
will give him his daughter, and make his @'s @ free in
@.

17:26 And @ @0 to the men that stood by him, @, What @
be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
reproach from @? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that
he @# defy the armies of the living God?  17:27 And the @
@> him @ this manner, @, So @ it be done to the man
that killeth him.

17:28 And Eliab his eldest @X @) when he @0 unto the men;
and Eliab's anger was kindled @
 @, and he said, Why camest
thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left @J few sheep in the
wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of @ @; for
thou art come down that thou @Best see the battle.

17:29 And @ said, What have I now done? Is @ not a cause?
17:30 And he turned from him toward @F, and @0 @ the same
manner: and the @ @> him @* @ the former manner.

17:31 And when the @5 were @) @ @ @0, they rehearsed
them @	 Saul: and he sent for him.

17:32 And @ said to Saul, Let no man's @ fail @ of him;
thy @< will go and fight with this Philistine.

17:33 And Saul said to @, Thou art not able to go @
 this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man
of war from his youth.

17:34 And @ said unto Saul, Thy @< kept his @'s sheep,
and @ came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
17:35 And I went out @ him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
his @P: and when he arose @
 me, I caught him by his beard,
and smote him, and slew him.

17:36 Thy @< slew both the lion and the bear: and this
uncircumcised Philistine @ be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God.

17:37 @ said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of
the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto @, Go, and the
LORD be with thee.

17:38 And Saul armed @ with his armour, and he put an helmet of
brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

17:39 And @ girded his @Q upon his armour, and he assayed to
go; for he had not proved it. And @ said unto Saul, I cannot go
with @; for I have not proved them. And @ put them off him.

17:40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag @ he
had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near
to the Philistine.

17:41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto @; and the man
that bare the shield went @	 him.

17:42 And when the Philistine looked @+, and saw @, he
disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
countenance.

17:43 And the Philistine said unto @, Am I a dog, that thou comest
to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed @ by his gods.

17:44 And the Philistine said to @, Come to me, and I will give
thy @R unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

17:45 Then said @ to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
@Q, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the
name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of @, whom thou
hast defied.

17:46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
smite thee, and take @ head from thee; and I will give the
carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the
air, and to the wild beasts of the @; that all the @ may know
that @ is a God in @.

17:47 And all this assembly @ know that the LORD saveth not with
@Q and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you
into our @D.

17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
drew nigh to meet @, that @ hastened, and ran toward the army
to meet the Philistine.

17:49 And @ put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone
sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the @.

17:50 So @ prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but @ was no @Q
in the hand of @.

17:51 @N @ ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
@Q, and drew it out of the sheath @of, and slew him, and cut
off his head @with. And when the Philistines saw @ champion
was dead, they fled.

17:52 And the men of @ and of @ arose, and shouted, and
pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the
gates of Ekron.

And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

17:53 And the @ of @ returned from chasing @ the
Philistines, and they spoiled @ tents.

17:54 And @ took the head of the Philistine, and @ it to
@ ; but he put his armour in his tent.

17:55 And when Saul saw @ go @ @
 the Philistine, he said
unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?
And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

17:56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

17:57 And as @ returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
Abner took him, and @ him @	 Saul with the head of the
Philistine in his hand.

17:58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
@ @>, I am the son of thy @< Jesse the Bethlehemite.

18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of @King unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of @, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

18:2 And Saul took him that day, and @L let him go no more home to
his @'s @.

18:3 Then Jonathan and @ made a covenant, @ he loved him as
his own soul.

18:4 And Jonathan stripped @9 of the robe that was upon him, and
gave it to @, and his garments, even to his @Q, and to his bow,
and to his girdle.

18:5 And @ went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
@9 wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was
accepted in the sight of all the @, and also in the sight of
Saul's @<s.

18:6 And it came to pass as they came, when @ was returned from
the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all @G
of @, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with
joy, and with instruments of musick.

18:7 And the women @> one @F as they played, and said, Saul
hath slain his @:s, and @ his ten @:s.

18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the @ displeased him; and he
said, They have ascribed unto @ ten @:s, and to me they have
ascribed but @:s: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
18:9 And Saul eyed @ from that day and forward.

18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the @a of the @: and @
played with his hand, as at @C times: and @ was a javelin in
Saul's hand.

18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite @ even
to the wall with it. And @ avoided out of his presence twice.

18:12 And Saul was afraid of @, @ the LORD was with him, and
was departed from Saul.

18:13 @N Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
over a @:; and he went out and came in @	 the @.

18:14 And @ behaved @9 wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
was with him.

18:15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved @9 very wisely, he
was afraid of him.

18:16 But all @ and @ loved @, @ he went out and
came in @	 them.

18:17 And Saul said to @, @. my elder daughter Merab, her will
I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's
battles.

For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the
Philistines be upon him.

18:18 And @ said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
@'s family in @, that I @# be son in law to the king?
18:19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
@# have been @= to @, that she was @= unto Adriel the
Meholathite to wife.

18:20 And Michal Saul's daughter loved @: and they told Saul, and
the @7 pleased him.

18:21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be @
 him.
Wherefore Saul said to @, Thou @ this day be my son in law in
the one of the twain.

18:22 And Saul @M his @<s, @, Commune with @
secretly, and say, @., the king hath delight in thee, and all his
@<s love thee: now @fore be the king's son in law.

18:23 And Saul's @<s @0 @J @5 in the ears of @. And
@ said, Seemeth it to you a light @7 to be a king's son in law,
seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  18:24 And the
@<s of Saul told him, @, On this manner @0 @.

18:25 And Saul said, Thus @ ye say to @, The king desireth not
any dowry, but an @/ foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged
of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make @ fall by the hand
of the Philistines.

18:26 And when his @<s told @ @ @5, it pleased @
well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.

18:27 Wherefore @ arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
Philistines two @/ men; and @ @ @ foreskins, and
they gave them in full tale to the king, that he @B be the king's
son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

18:28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with @, and that
Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

18:29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of @; and Saul became
@'s enemy continually.

18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines went @: and it came to
pass, @ they went @, that @ behaved @9 more wisely
than all the @<s of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

19:1 And Saul @0 to Jonathan his son, and to all his @<s, that
they @# kill @.

19:2 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in @: and Jonathan
told @, @, Saul my @ seeketh to kill thee: now
@fore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and
abide in a secret @', and hide thyself: 19:3 And I will go out and
stand beside my @ in the field where thou art, and I will commune
with my @ of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.

19:4 And Jonathan @0 good of @ unto Saul his @, and said
unto him, Let not the king sin @
 his @<, @
 @;
@ he hath not sinned @
 thee, and @ his works have
been to thee-ward very good: 19:5 For he did put his life in his hand,
and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a @ salvation for
all @: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt
thou sin @
 innocent @I, to slay @ @S a cause?  19:6
And Saul hearkened unto the @; of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the
LORD liveth, he @ not be slain.

19:7 And Jonathan @, @, and Jonathan shewed him all @J
@.

And Jonathan @ @ to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in
times past.

19:8 And @ was war @*: and @ went out, and fought with the
Philistines, and slew them with a @ slaughter; and they fled from
him.

19:9 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
@ with his javelin in his hand: and @ played with his hand.

19:10 And Saul sought to smite @ even to the wall with the
javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the
javelin into the wall: and @ fled, and escaped that night.

19:11 Saul also sent messengers unto @'s @, to watch him, and
to slay him in the morning: and Michal @'s wife told him, @,
If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou @ be slain.

19:12 So Michal let @ down @E a window: and he went, and
fled, and escaped.

19:13 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.

19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take @, she said, He is
sick.

19:15 And Saul sent the messengers @* to see @, @, Bring
him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

19:16 And when the messengers were come in, @%, @ was an image
in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.

19:17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal @> Saul, He
said unto me, Let me go; why @# I kill thee?  19:18 So @ fled,
and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul
had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.

19:19 And it was told Saul, @, @., @ is at Naioth in
Ramah.

19:20 And Saul sent messengers to take @: and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed
over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they
also prophesied.

19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent @C messengers, and they
prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers @* the third time,
and they prophesied also.

19:22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a @ well that is in
Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and @? And one
said, @., they be at Naioth in Ramah.

19:23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to
Naioth in Ramah.

19:24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied @	
Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that
night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also @ the prophets?  20:1 And
@ fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said @	 Jonathan,
What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin @	 thy
@, that he seeketh my life?  20:2 And he said unto him, God
forbid; thou @ not die: @%, my @ will do no@7 either
@ or small, but that he will shew it me: and why @# my @
hide this @7 from me? it is not so.

20:3 And @ sware moreover, and said, Thy @ certainly knoweth
that I have @V grace in @ eyes; and he @
, Let not Jonathan
know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as
thy soul liveth, @ is but a step between me and @^.

20:4 Then said Jonathan unto @, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
will even do it for thee.

20:5 And @ said unto Jonathan, @., to morrow is the new moon,
and I @# not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go,
that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.

20:6 If thy @ at all miss me, then say, @ earnestly asked
leave of me that he @B run to Bethlehem his city: for @ is a
yearly sacrifice @ for all the family.

20:7 If he say thus, It is well; thy @< @ have @U: but if
he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.

20:8 @N thou @ deal kindly with thy @<; for thou hast
@ thy @< into a covenant of the LORD with thee:
notwithstanding, if @ be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why
@#est thou @( me to thy @?  20:9 And Jonathan said, Far be
it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my
@ to come upon thee, then @L not I tell it thee?  20:10 Then
said @ to Jonathan, Who @ tell me? or what if thy @
answer thee roughly?  20:11 And Jonathan said unto @, Come, and
let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the
field.

20:12 And Jonathan said unto @, O LORD God of @, when I have
sounded my @ @+ to morrow any time, or the third day, and,
@%, if @ be good toward @, and I then send not unto thee,
and shew it thee; 20:13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but
if it please my @ to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and
send thee away, that thou mayest go in @U: and the LORD be with
thee, as he hath been with my @.

20:14 And thou @ not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
the LORD, that I die not: 20:15 But also thou @ not cut off thy
kindness from my @ for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off
the enemies of @ @ one from the face of the @.

20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the @ of @, @, Let
the LORD even require it at the hand of @'s enemies.

20:17 And Jonathan caused @ to swear @*, @ he loved him:
for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

20:18 Then Jonathan said to @, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
@ be missed, @ thy seat will be empty.

20:19 And when thou hast stayed @@ days, then thou @ go down
quickly, and come to the @' where thou didst hide thyself when the
business was in hand, and @ remain by the stone Ezel.

20:20 And I will shoot @@ arrows on the side @of, as though I
shot at a mark.

20:21 And, @%, I will send a lad, @, Go, find out the arrows.
If I expressly say unto the lad, @., the arrows are on this side
of thee, take them; then come thou: for @ is @U to thee, and no
hurt; as the LORD liveth.

20:22 But if I say thus unto the young man, @., the arrows are
beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

20:23 And as touching the matter @ thou and I have spoken of,
@%, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

20:24 So @ hid @9 in the field: and when the new moon was
come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

20:25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at @C times, even upon a
seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side,
and @'s @' was empty.

20:26 Nevertheless Saul @0 not any @7 that day: for he thought,
Some@7 hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.

20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, @ was the second day of
the month, that @'s @' was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan
his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, @"
yesterday, nor to day?  20:28 And Jonathan @> Saul, @
earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: 20:29 And he said, Let
me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and
my @X, he hath @M me to be @: and now, if I have @V
favour in @ eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my
@3. @N he cometh not unto the king's table.

20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled @
 Jonathan, and he said unto
him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that
thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to @ own confusion, and unto the
confusion of thy m@C's nakedness?  20:31 For as long as the son of
Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou @ not be established, nor thy
kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he @ surely
die.

20:32 And Jonathan @> Saul his @, and said unto him,
Wherefore @ he be slain? what hath he done?  20:33 And Saul cast a
javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was
determined of his @ to slay @.

20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for @,
@ his @ had done him shame.

20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
the field at the time appointed with @, and a little lad with him.

20:36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows @ I
shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

20:37 And when the lad was come to the @' of the arrow @
Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried @ the lad, and said, Is not the
arrow beyond thee?  20:38 And Jonathan cried @ the lad, Make
speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad ga@d up the arrows, and
came to his master.

20:39 But the lad knew not any @7: only Jonathan and @ knew the
matter.

20:40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
Go, carry them to the city.

20:41 And as soon as the lad was gone, @ arose out of a @'
toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
@9 @@ times: and they kissed one @F, and wept one with
@F, until @ exceeded.

20:42 And Jonathan said to @, Go in @U, forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, @, The LORD be between
me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose
and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

21:1 Then came @ to Nob to Ahimelech the @6: and Ahimelech was
afraid at the meeting of @, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,
and no man with thee?  21:2 And @ said unto Ahimelech the @6,
The king hath @M me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no
man know any @7 of the business where@+ I send thee, and what I
have @M thee: and I have appointed my @<s to such and such
a @'.

21:3 Now @fore what is @[ @ hand? give me five loaves of
@d in mine hand, or what @ is present.

21:4 And the @6 @> @, and said, There is no common @d
@[ mine hand, but @ is hallowed @d; if the young men have
kept @T at least from women.

21:5 And @ @> the @6, and said unto him, Of a truth
women have been kept from us @+ @ @@ days, since I came out,
and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the @d is in a
manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

21:6 So the @6 gave him hallowed @d: for @ was no @d
@ but the shew@d, that was taken from @	 the LORD, to put
hot @d in the day when it was taken away.

21:7 Now a certain man of the @<s of Saul was @ that day,
detained @	 the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

21:8 And @ said unto Ahimelech, And is @ not here @[ @
hand spear or @Q? for I have @" @ my @Q nor my
weapons with me, @ the king's business required haste.

21:9 And the @6 said, The @Q of Goliath the Philistine, whom
thou slewest in the valley of Elah, @%, it is here wrapped in a
cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for @ is
no @C save that here. And @ said, There is none like that; give
it me.

21:10 And @ arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
Achish the king of Gath.

21:11 And the @<s of Achish said unto him, Is not this @ the
king of the land? did they not sing one to @F of him in dances,
@, Saul hath slain his @:s, and @ his ten @:s?
21:12 And @ laid up @ @5 in his @, and was sore afraid
of Achish the king of Gath.

21:13 And he changed his behaviour @	 them, and feigned @9
mad in @ @D, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let
his spittle fall down upon his beard.

21:14 Then said Achish unto his @<s, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
wherefore then have ye @ him to me?  21:15 Have I need of mad
men, that ye have @ this fellow to play the mad man in my
presence? @ this fellow come into my @?  22:1 @ @fore
departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his
@3 and all his @'s @ @) it, they went down thither
to him.

22:2 And @ one that was in distress, and @ one that was in
debt, and @ one that was discontented, ga@d @T unto
him; and he became a captain over them: and @ were with him @+
four @/ men.

22:3 And @ went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
king of Moab, Let my @ and my m@C, I pray thee, come @,
and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

22:4 And he @ them @	 the king of Moab: and they dwelt with
him all the while that @ was in the hold.

22:5 And the prophet Gad said unto @, Abide not in the hold;
depart, and get thee into the land of @. Then @ departed, and
came into the forest of Hareth.

22:6 When Saul @) that @ was discovered, and the men that were
with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah @[ a tree in Ramah, having his
spear in his hand, and all his @<s were standing @+ him;) 22:7
Then Saul said unto his @<s that stood @+ him, Hear now, ye
Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give @ one of you fields and
vineyards, and make you all captains of @:s, and captains of
@/s; 22:8 That all of you have conspired @
 me, and @ is
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
Jesse, and @ is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto
me that my son hath stirred up my @< @
 me, to lie in wait,
as at this day?  22:9 Then @> Doeg the Edomite, @ was set
over the @<s of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

22:10 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and
gave him the @Q of Goliath the Philistine.

22:11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the @6, the son of
Ahitub, and all his @'s @, the @6s that were in Nob: and
they came all of them to the king.

22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he @>,
Here I am, my lord.

22:13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired @
 me, thou
and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast @= him @d, and a @Q,
and hast enquired of God for him, that he @# rise @
 me, to
lie in wait, as at this day?  22:14 Then Ahimelech @> the king,
and said, And who is so faithful @ all thy @<s as @,
@ is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is
honourable in @ @?  22:15 Did I then begin to enquire of God
for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any @7 unto his
@<, nor to all the @ of my @: for thy @< knew
no@7 of all this, less or more.

22:16 And the king said, Thou @ surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
all thy @'s @.

22:17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood @+ him, Turn,
and slay the @6s of the LORD: @ @ hand also is with
@, and @ they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.
But the @<s of the king @L not put @ @ hand to fall
upon the @6s of the LORD.

22:18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the @6s.
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the @6s, and slew on
that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

22:19 And Nob, the city of the @6s, smote he with the edge of the
@Q, both men and women, @ and sucklings, and oxen, and
asses, and sheep, with the edge of the @Q.

22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
Abiathar, escaped, and fled @ @.

22:21 And Abiathar shewed @ that Saul had slain the LORD's
@6s.

22:22 And @ said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
Edomite was @, that he @L surely tell Saul: I have occasioned
the @^ of all the persons of thy @'s @.

22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
seeketh thy life: but with me thou @ be in safeguard.

23:1 Then they told @, @, @., the Philistines fight
@
 Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

23:2 @N @ enquired of the LORD, @, Shall I go and
smite @ Philistines? And the LORD said unto @, Go, and smite
the Philistines, and save Keilah.

23:3 And @'s men said unto him, @., we be afraid here in
@: how much more then if we come to Keilah @
 the armies of
the Philistines?  23:4 Then @ enquired of the LORD yet @*. And
the LORD @> him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
deliver the Philistines into @ hand.

23:5 So @ and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
Philistines, and @ away @ cattle, and smote them with a
@ slaughter. So @ saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
@ to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

23:7 And it was told Saul that @ was come to Keilah. And Saul
said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by
entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

23:8 And Saul @, all the @ @? to war, to go down to
Keilah, to besiege @ and his men.

23:9 And @ knew that Saul secretly practised mischief @
 him;
and he said to Abiathar the @6, Bring hither the ephod.

23:10 Then said @, O LORD God of @, thy @< hath
certainly @) that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the
city for my sake.

23:11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
come down, as thy @< hath @)? O LORD God of @, I beseech
thee, tell thy @<. And the LORD said, He will come down.

23:12 Then said @, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.

23:13 Then @ and his men, @ were @+ six @/, arose and
departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it
was told Saul that @ was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go
@.

23:14 And @ abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him @
day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

23:15 And @ saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and @
was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

23:16 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to @ into the wood,
and strengthened his hand in God.

23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my @
@ not find thee; and thou @ be king over @, and I @
be next unto thee; and that also Saul my @ knoweth.

23:18 And they two made a covenant @	 the LORD: and @ abode in
the wood, and Jonathan went to his @.

23:19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, @, Doth not
@ hide @9 with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of
Hachilah, @ is on the south of Jeshimon?  23:20 Now @fore, O
king, come down @$ to all the desire of thy soul to come down;
and our part @ be to deliver him into the king's hand.

23:21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion
on me.

23:22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his @' where
his haunt is, and who hath seen him @: for it is told me that he
dealeth very subtilly.

23:23 See @fore, and take knowledge of all the lurking @'s
where he hideth @9, and come ye @* to me with the certainty,
and I will go with you: and it @ come to pass, if he be in the
land, that I will search him out @Eout all the @:s of
@.

23:24 And they arose, and went to Ziph @	 Saul: but @ and his
men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of
Jeshimon.

23:25 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told @;
wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of
Maon. And when Saul @) that, he pursued @ @ in the
wilderness of Maon.

23:26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and @ and his
men on that side of the mountain: and @ made haste to get away for
fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed @ and his men round
@+ to take them.

23:27 But @ came a messenger unto Saul, @, Haste thee, and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing @ @, and went
@
 the Philistines: @fore they @, that @'
Selahammahlekoth.

23:29 And @ went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
Engedi.

24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, that it was told him, @, @., @ is in the
wilderness of Engedi.

24:2 Then Saul took @@ @: chosen men out of all @, and
went to seek @ and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
Saul went in to cover his feet: and @ and his men remained in the
sides of the cave.

24:4 And the men of @ said unto him, @. the day of @ the
LORD said unto thee, @., I will deliver @ enemy into @
hand, that thou mayest do to him as it @ seem good unto thee. Then
@ arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

24:5 And it came to pass @ward, that @'s @ smote him,
@ he had cut off Saul's skirt.

24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I @# do this
@7 unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch @ mine hand
@
 him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.

24:7 So @ stayed his @<s with @ @5, and suffered them
not to rise @
 Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went
on his way.

24:8 @ also arose @ward, and went out of the cave, and cried
@ Saul, @, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,
@ stooped with his face to the @, and bowed @9.

24:9 And @ said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's @5,
@, @., @ seeketh thy hurt?  24:10 @., this day @
eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine
hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared
thee; and I said, I will not put @ mine hand @
 my lord; for
he is the LORD's anointed.

24:11 Moreover, my @, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee
not, know thou and see that @ is @" evil nor transgression in
mine hand, and I have not sinned @
 thee; yet thou huntest my
soul to take it.

24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
thee: but mine hand @ not be upon thee.

24:13 As @
 the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from
the wicked: but mine hand @ not be upon thee.

24:14 After whom is the king of @ come out? @ whom dost thou
pursue? @ a dead dog, @ a flea.

24:15 The LORD @fore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of @ hand.

24:16 And it came to pass, when @ had made an end of @King
@ @5 unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy @;, my son
@? And Saul lifted up his @;, and wept.

24:17 And he said to @, Thou art more @ceous than I: for thou
hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into @ hand, thou
killedst me not.

24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me
this day.

24:20 And now, @%, I know well that thou @ surely be king, and
that the kingdom of @ @ be established in @ hand.

24:21 Swear now @fore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
off my seed @ me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
@'s @.

24:22 And @ sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but @ and his
men gat them up unto the hold.

25:1 And Samuel died; and all the @ites were ga@d @?,
and lamented him, and buried him in his @ at Ramah. And @
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

25:2 And @ was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
and the man was very @, and he had @@ @: sheep, and a
@: goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
Abigail: and she was a woman of good @[standing, and of a beautiful
countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he
was of the @ of Caleb.

25:4 And @ @) in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

25:5 And @ sent out ten young men, and @ said unto the young
men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
25:6 And thus @ ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be
both to thee, and @U be to @ @, and @U be unto all that
thou hast.

25:7 And now I have @) that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds
@ were with us, we hurt them not, @" was @ ought missing
unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.

25:8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
young men find favour in @ eyes: for we come in a good day: give,
I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to @ hand unto thy @<s, and to
thy son @.

25:9 And when @'s young men came, they @0 to Nabal @$ to
all @J @5 in the name of @, and ceased.

25:10 And Nabal @> @'s @<s, and said, Who is @? and
who is the son of Jesse? @ be many @<s now a days that break
away @ man from his master.

25:11 Shall I then take my @d, and my @Z, and my @R that I
have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not
whence they be?  25:12 So @'s young men turned @ way, and went
@*, and came and told him all @J @s.

25:13 And @ said unto his men, Gird ye on @ man his @Q. And
they girded on @ man his @Q; and @ also girded on his
@Q: and @ went up @ @ @+ four @/ men; and two
@/ abode by the stuff.

25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, @,
@., @ sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
master; and he railed on them.

25:15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
@" missed we any @7, as long as we were conversant with them,
when we were in the fields: 25:16 They were a wall unto us both by
night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.

25:17 Now @fore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
determined @
 our master, and @
 all his @hold: for he
is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot @K to him.

25:18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two @/ loaves, and two
bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of
parched corn, and an @/ clusters of raisins, and two @/
cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

25:19 And she said unto her @<s, Go on @	 me; @%, I come
@ you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
covert on the hill, and, @%, @ and his men came down @

her; and she met them.

25:21 Now @ had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
fellow hath in the wilderness, so that no@7 was missed of all that
pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.

25:22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of @, if I leave of
all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth @

the wall.

25:23 And when Abigail saw @, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
and fell @	 @ on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
25:24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
this iniquity be: and let @ handmaid, I pray thee, @K in @
audience, and hear the @5 of @ handmaid.

25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is
with him: but I @ handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom
thou didst send.

25:26 Now @fore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed
@I, and from avenging thyself with @ own hand, now let @
enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

25:27 And now this blessing @ @ handmaid hath @ unto my
lord, let it even be @= unto the young men that follow my lord.

25:28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of @ handmaid: for the
LORD will certainly make my lord a sure @; @ my lord
fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been @V in thee
all thy days.

25:29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
soul of my lord @ be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy
God; and the souls of @ enemies, them @ he sling out, as out
of the middle of a sling.

25:30 And it @ come to pass, when the LORD @ have done to my
lord @$ to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,
and @ have appointed thee ruler over @; 25:31 That this @
be no grief unto thee, nor offence of @ unto my lord, either that
thou hast shed @I causeless, or that my lord hath avenged @9:
but when the LORD @ have dealt well with my lord, then remember
@ handmaid.

25:32 And @ said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of @,
@ sent thee this day to meet me: 25:33 And blessed be thy advice,
and blessed be thou, @ hast kept me this day from coming to shed
@I, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

25:34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of @ liveth, @ hath
kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to
meet me, surely @ had not been left unto Nabal by the morning
light any that pisseth @
 the wall.

25:35 So @ received of her hand that @ she had @ him,
and said unto her, Go up in @U to @ @; see, I have
hearkened to thy @;, and have accepted thy person.

25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, @%, he held a feast in his
@, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's @ was merry within
him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him no@7, less or
more, until the morning light.

25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
of Nabal, and his wife had told him @ @, that his @ died
within him, and he became as a stone.

25:38 And it came to pass @+ ten days @, that the LORD smote
Nabal, that he died.

25:39 And when @ @) that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of
Nabal, and hath kept his @< from evil: for the LORD hath returned
the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And @ sent and communed
with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.

25:40 And when the @<s of @ were come to Abigail to Carmel,
they @0 unto her, @, @ sent us unto thee, to take thee to
him to wife.

25:41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the @, and
said, @., let @ handmaid be a @< to wash the feet of the
@<s of my lord.

25:42 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
damsels of hers that went @ her; and she went @ the messengers
of @, and became his wife.

25:43 @ also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
them his wives.

25:44 But Saul had @= Michal his daughter, @'s wife, to Phalti
the son of Laish, @ was of Gallim.

26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, @, Doth not @
hide @9 in the hill of Hachilah, @ is @	 Jeshimon?  26:2
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having @@
@: chosen men of @ with him, to seek @ in the
wilderness of Ziph.

26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, @ is @	
Jeshimon, by the way. But @ abode in the wilderness, and he saw
that Saul came @ him into the wilderness.

26:4 @ @fore sent out spies, and @[stood that Saul was come
in very deed.

26:5 And @ arose, and came to the @' where Saul had pitched:
and @ beheld the @' where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the @
pitched round @+ him.

26:6 Then @> @ and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, @X to Joab, @, Who will go down
with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with
thee.

26:7 So @ and Abishai came to the @ by night: and, @%,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster: but Abner and the @ lay round @+ him.

26:8 Then said Abishai to @, God hath delivered @ enemy into
@ hand this day: now @fore let me smite him, I pray thee, with
the spear even to the @ at once, and I will not smite him the
second time.

26:9 And @ said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
@ his hand @
 the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?  26:10
@ said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD @ smite him;
or his day @ come to die; or he @ descend into battle, and
perish.

26:11 The LORD forbid that I @# stretch @ mine hand @

the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is
at his bolster, and the cruse of @Z, and let us go.

26:12 So @ took the spear and the cruse of @Z from Saul's
bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,
@" awaked: for they were all asleep; @ a deep sleep from
the LORD was fallen upon them.

26:13 Then @ went over to the @C side, and stood on the top of
an hill afar off; a @ space being between them: 26:14 And @
cried to the @, and to Abner the son of Ner, @, Answerest
thou not, Abner? Then Abner @> and said, Who art thou that
criest to the king?  26:15 And @ said to Abner, Art not thou a
valiant man? and who is like to thee in @? wherefore then hast
thou not kept thy lord the king? for @ came one of the @ in
to destroy the king thy lord.

26:16 This @7 is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
ye are worthy to die, @ ye have not kept your master, the LORD's
anointed.

And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of @Z that was
at his bolster.

26:17 And Saul knew @'s @;, and said, Is this thy @;, my son
@? And @ said, It is my @;, my lord, O king.

26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue @ his
@<?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  26:19
Now @fore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the @5 of his
@<. If the LORD have stirred thee up @
 me, let him accept
an @&: but if they be the @ of men, cursed be they @	
the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the
inheritance of the LORD, @, Go, serve @C gods.

26:20 Now @fore, let not my @I fall to the @ @	 the
face of the LORD: for the king of @ is come out to seek a flea,
as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son @: for I will
no more do thee harm, @ my soul was precious in @ eyes this
day: @%, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

26:22 And @ @> and said, @. the king's spear! and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it.

26:23 The LORD render to @ man his @ceousness and his
faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I
@L not stretch @ mine hand @
 the LORD's anointed.

26:24 And, @%, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him
deliver me out of all tribulation.

26:25 Then Saul said to @, Blessed be thou, my son @: thou
@ both do @ @, and also @ still prevail. So @
went on his way, and Saul returned to his @'.

27:1 And @ said in his @, I @ now perish one day by the
hand of Saul: @ is no@7 better for me than that I @#
speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul @
despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of @: so @ I
escape out of his hand.

27:2 And @ arose, and he passed over with the six @/ men that
were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

27:3 And @ dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, @ man
with his @hold, even @ with his two wives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

27:4 And it was told Saul that @ was fled to Gath: and he sought
no more @* for him.

27:5 And @ said unto Achish, If I have now @V grace in @
eyes, let them give me a @' in some town in the country, that I may
dwell @: for why @# thy @< dwell in the royal city with
thee?  27:6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
pertaineth unto the kings of @ unto this day.

27:7 And the time that @ dwelt in the country of the Philistines
was a full year and four months.

27:8 And @ and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for @J nations were of old the
inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of
@-.

27:9 And @ smote the land, and left @" man nor woman alive,
and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,
and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.

27:10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And @
said, Against the south of @, and @
 the south of the
Jerahmeelites, and @
 the south of the Kenites.

27:11 And @ saved @" man nor woman alive, to @( tidings to
Gath, @, Lest they @# tell on us, @, So did @, and
so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
Philistines.

27:12 And Achish believed @, @, He hath made his @
@ utterly to abhor him; @fore he @ be my @< for
ever.

28:1 And it came to pass in @J days, that the Philistines ga@d
@ armies @? for warfare, to fight with @. And Achish
said unto @, Know thou assuredly, that thou @ go out with me
to battle, thou and thy men.

28:2 And @ said to Achish, Surely thou @ know what thy @<
can do. And Achish said to @, @N will I make thee keeper of
mine head for ever.

28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all @ had lamented him, and buried
him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away @J that
had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

28:4 And the Philistines ga@d @T @?, and came and
pitched in Shunem: and Saul ga@d all @ @?, and they
pitched in Gilboa.

28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and
his @ @ly trembled.

28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD @> him not,
@" by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

28:7 Then said Saul unto his @<s, Seek me a woman that hath a
familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his
@<s said to him, @., @ is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at Endor.

28:8 And Saul disguised @9, and put on @C raiment, and he
went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and
he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and @(
me him up, whom I @ name unto thee.

28:9 And the woman said unto him, @., thou knowest what Saul hath
done, how he hath cut off @J that have familiar spirits, and the
wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my
life, to cause me to die?  28:10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD,
@, As the LORD liveth, @ @ no punishment happen to thee
for this @7.

28:11 Then said the woman, Whom @ I @( up unto thee? And he
said, Bring me up Samuel.

28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud @;: and
the woman @0 to Saul, @, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou
art Saul.

28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the @.

28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived
that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and
bowed @9.

28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to @(
me up? And Saul @>, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
make war @
 me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no
more, @" by prophets, nor by dreams: @fore I have @,
thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I @ do.

28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
LORD is departed from thee, and is become @ enemy?  28:17 And the
LORD hath done to him, as he @0 by me: for the LORD hath rent the
kingdom out of @ hand, and @= it to thy neighbour, even to
@: 28:18 Because thou obeyedst not the @; of the LORD, nor
executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, @fore hath the LORD done
this @7 unto thee this day.

28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver @ with thee into the
hand of the Philistines: and to morrow @ thou and thy sons be with
me: the LORD also @ deliver the host of @ into the hand of
the Philistines.

28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the @, and was sore
afraid, @ of the @5 of Samuel: and @ was no strength in
him; for he had eaten no @d all the day, nor all the night.

28:21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
and said unto him, @., @ handmaid hath obeyed thy @;, and I
have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy @5 @
thou @0st unto me.

28:22 Now @fore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the @; of
@ handmaid, and let me set a morsel of @d @	 thee; and eat,
that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

28:23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his @<s,
@? with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto @
@;. So he arose from the @, and sat upon the bed.

28:24 And the woman had a fat calf in the @; and she hasted, and
killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened
@d @of: 28:25 And she @ it @	 Saul, and @	 his
@<s; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that
night.

29:1 Now the Philistines ga@d @? all @ armies to Aphek:
and the @ites pitched by a fountain @ is in Jezreel.

29:2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by @/s, and by
@:s: but @ and his men passed on in the rereward with
Achish.

29:3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do @ Hebrews
here?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not
this @, the @< of Saul the king of @, @ hath been
with me @ days, or @ @8, and I have @V no fault in him
since he fell unto me unto this day?  29:4 And the princes of the
Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines
said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go @* to his
@' @ thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us
to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith
@# he reconcile @9 unto his master? @# it not be with the
heads of @ men?  29:5 Is not this @, of whom they sang one to
@F in dances, @, Saul slew his @:s, and @ his ten
@:s?  29:6 Then Achish @, @, and said unto him, Surely,
as the LORD liveth, thou hast been up@c, and thy going out and thy
coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not
@V evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day:
nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

29:7 Wherefore now return, and go in @U, that thou displease not
the lords of the Philistines.

29:8 And @ said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast
thou @V in thy @< so long as I have been with thee unto this
day, that I may not go fight @
 the enemies of my lord the king?
29:9 And Achish @> and said to @, I know that thou art good
in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the
Philistines have said, He @ not go up with us to the battle.

29:10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
@<s that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning, and have light, depart.

29:11 So @ and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up
to Jezreel.

30:1 And it came to pass, when @ and his men were come to Ziklag
on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and
Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 30:2 And had
taken the women captives, that were @in: they slew not any, either
@ or small, but carried them away, and went on @ way.

30:3 So @ and his men came to the city, and, @%, it was burned
with fire; and @ wives, and @ sons, and @ daughters, were
taken captives.

30:4 Then @ and the @ that were with him lifted up @
@; and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

30:5 And @'s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

30:6 And @ was @ly distressed; for the @ @0 of stoning
him, @ the soul of all the @ was grieved, @ man for his
sons and for his daughters: but @ encouraged @9 in the LORD
his God.

30:7 And @ said to Abiathar the @6, Ahimelech's son, I pray
thee, @( me hither the ephod. And Abiathar @ thither the
ephod to @.

30:8 And @ enquired at the LORD, @, Shall I pursue @ this
troop? @ I overtake them? And he @> him, Pursue: for thou
@ surely overtake them, and @S fail recover all.

30:9 So @ went, he and the six @/ men that were with him, and
came to the brook Besor, where @J that were left behind stayed.

30:10 But @ pursued, he and four @/ men: for two @/
abode behind, @ were so faint that they could not go over the
brook Besor.

30:11 And they @V an @-ian in the field, and @ him to
@, and gave him @d, and he did eat; and they made him @b
@Z; 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two
clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came @* to
him: for he had eaten no @d, nor drunk any @Z, @@ days and
@@ nights.

30:13 And @ said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
thou? And he said, I am a young man of @-, @< to an Amalekite;
and my master left me, @ @@ days agone I fell sick.

30:14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
the coast @ belongeth to @, and upon the south of Caleb; and
we burned Ziklag with fire.

30:15 And @ said to him, Canst thou @( me down to this company?
And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt @" kill me, nor
deliver me into the @D of my master, and I will @( thee down to
this company.

30:16 And when he had @ him down, @%, they were spread
abroad upon all the @, eating and @bing, and dancing, @
of all the @ spoil that they had taken out of the land of the
Philistines, and out of the land of @.

30:17 And @ smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
the next day: and @ escaped not a man of them, save four @/
young men, @ rode upon camels, and fled.

30:18 And @ recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
and @ rescued his two wives.

30:19 And @ was no@7 lacking to them, @" small nor @,
@" sons nor daughters, @" spoil, nor any @7 that they had
taken to them: @ recovered all.

30:20 And @ took all the flocks and the herds, @ they drave
@	 @J @C cattle, and said, This is @'s spoil.

30:21 And @ came to the two @/ men, @ were so faint that
they could not follow @, whom they had made also to abide at the
brook Besor: and they went @ to meet @, and to meet the @
that were with him: and when @ came near to the @, he saluted
them.

30:22 Then @> all the wicked men and men of Belial, of @J
that went with @, and said, Because they went not with us, we will
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to @
man his wife and his @, that they may lead them away, and
depart.

30:23 Then said @, Ye @ not do so, my @3, with that
@ the LORD hath @= us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the
company that came @
 us into our hand.

30:24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
that goeth down to the battle, so @ his part be that tarrieth by
the stuff: they @ part alike.

30:25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
and an ordinance for @ unto this day.

30:26 And when @ came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of @, even to his friends, @, @. a present for you
of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 30:27 To them @ were in
Bethel, and to them @ were in south Ramoth, and to them @ were
in Jattir, 30:28 And to them @ were in Aroer, and to them @
were in Siphmoth, and to them @ were in Eshtemoa, 30:29 And to
them @ were in Rachal, and to them @ were in the @G of the
Jerahmeelites, and to them @ were in the @G of the Kenites,
30:30 And to them @ were in Hormah, and to them @ were in
Chorashan, and to them @ were in Athach, 30:31 And to them @
were in Hebron, and to all the @'s where @ @9 and his men
were wont to haunt.

31:1 Now the Philistines fought @
 @: and the men of @
fled from @	 the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

31:2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,
Saul's sons.

31:3 And the battle went sore @
 Saul, and the archers hit him;
and he was sore wounded of the archers.

31:4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy @Q, and thrust
me @E @with; lest @ uncircumcised come and thrust me
@E, and abuse me. But his armourbearer @L not; for he was sore
afraid. @N Saul took a @Q, and fell upon it.

31:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
likewise upon his @Q, and died with him.

31:6 So Saul died, and his @@ sons, and his armourbearer, and all
his men, that same day @?.

31:7 And when the men of @ that were on the @C side of the
valley, and they that were on the @C side Jordan, saw that the men
of @ fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the
@G, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
strip the slain, that they @V Saul and his @@ sons fallen in
mount Gilboa.

31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent
into the land of the Philistines round @+, to publish it in the
@ of @ idols, and @ the @.

31:10 And they put his armour in the @ of Ashtaroth: and they
fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

31:11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead @) of that @ the
Philistines had done to Saul; 31:12 All the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons
from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and @_ them @.

31:13 And they took @ bones, and buried them @[ a tree at

1:1 Now it came to pass @ the @^ of Saul, when @ was
returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and @ had abode two
days in Ziklag; 1:2 It came even to pass on the third day, that,
@%, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent,
and @ upon his head: and so it was, when he came to @, that he
fell to the @, and did obeisance.

1:3 And @ said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
him, Out of the camp of @ am I escaped.

1:4 And @ said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
me.

And he @>, That the @ are fled from the battle, and many of
the @ also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are
dead also.

1:5 And @ said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  1:6 And the young man that
told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, @%, Saul
leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed
hard @ him.

1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and @, unto me. And
I @>, Here am I.

1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I @> him, I am an
Amalekite.

1:9 He said unto me @*, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
for anguish is come upon me, @ my life is yet whole in me.

1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, @ I was sure that he
could not live @ that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was
upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have @
them hither unto my lord.

1:11 Then @ took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
all the men that were with him: 1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and
fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the
@ of the LORD, and for the @ of @; @ they were
fallen by the @Q.

1:13 And @ said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
And he @>, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

1:14 And @ said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
@ @ hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?  1:15 And @
@, one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And
he smote him that he died.

1:16 And @ said unto him, Thy @I be upon thy head; for thy
@P hath testified @
 thee, @, I have slain the LORD's
anointed.

1:17 And @ lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son: 1:18 (Also he bade them teach the @ of @
the use of the bow: @%, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
1:19 The beauty of @ is slain upon thy high @'s: how are the
@By fallen!  1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the
streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let @ be no dew, @" let @ be
rain, upon you, nor fields of @&s: for @ the shield of the
@By is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not
been anointed with oil.

1:22 From the @I of the slain, from the fat of the @By, the bow
of Jonathan turned not back, and the @Q of Saul returned not empty.

1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in @ lives, and in
@ @^ they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they
were stronger than lions.

1:24 Ye daughters of @, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
scarlet, with @C delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your
apparel.

1:25 How are the @By fallen in the @a of the battle! O Jonathan,
thou wast slain in @ high @'s.

1:26 I am distressed for thee, my @X Jonathan: very pleasant hast
thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women.

1:27 How are the @By fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  2:1
And it came to pass @ this, that @ enquired of the LORD,
@, Shall I go up into any of the @G of @? And the LORD
said unto him, Go up. And @ said, Whither @ I go up? And he
said, Unto Hebron.

2:2 So @ went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

2:3 And his men that were with him did @ @( up, @ man with
his @hold: and they dwelt in the @G of Hebron.

2:4 And the men of @ came, and @ they anointed @ king over
the @ of @. And they told @, @, That the men of
Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

2:5 And @ sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said
unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this
kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

2:6 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
requite you this kindness, @ ye have done this @7.

2:7 @N now let your @D be strengthened, and be ye valiant:
for your master Saul is dead, and also the @ of @ have
anointed me king over them.

2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth
the son of Saul, and @ him over to Mahanaim; 2:9 And made him
king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over
Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all @.

2:10 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty @8 old when he began to reign
over @, and reigned two @8. But the @ of @ followed
@.

2:11 And the time that @ was king in Hebron over the @ of
@ was @H @8 and six months.

2:12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the @<s of Ishbosheth the son
of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the @<s of @, went out,
and met @? by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on
the one side of the pool, and the @C on the @C side of the pool.

2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
@	 us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

2:15 Then @ arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
@ pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
@<s of @.

2:16 And they caught @ one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
@Q in his fellow's side; so they fell down @?: wherefore that
@' was @, Helkathhazzurim, @ is in Gibeon.

2:17 And @ was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
and the men of @, @	 the @<s of @.

2:18 And @ were @@ sons of Zeruiah @, Joab, and Abishai,
and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

2:19 And Asahel pursued @ Abner; and in going he turned not to the
@c hand nor to the left from following Abner.

2:20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
@>, I am.

2:21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy @c hand or to
thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his
armour.

But Asahel @L not turn aside from following of him.

2:22 And Abner said @* to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
me: wherefore @# I smite thee to the ground? how then @# I
hold up my face to Joab thy @X?  2:23 Howbeit he refused to turn
aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him
@[ the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell
down @, and died in the same @': and it came to pass, that as
many as came to the @' where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

2:24 Joab also and Abishai pursued @ Abner: and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth @	 Giah by
the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

2:25 And the @ of Benjamin ga@d @T @? @
Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

2:26 Then Abner @, to Joab, and said, Shall the @Q devour for
ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
how long @ it be then, ere thou bid the @ return from
following @ @3?  2:27 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless
thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the @ had gone up
@ one from following his @X.

2:28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the @ stood still, and
pursued @ @ no more, @" fought they any more.

2:29 And Abner and his men walked all that night @E the plain,
and passed over Jordan, and went @E all Bithron, and they came to
Mahanaim.

2:30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had ga@d
all the @ @?, @ lacked of @'s @<s nineteen men
and Asahel.

2:31 But the @<s of @ had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's
men, so that @@ @/ and @@score men died.

2:32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
@, @ was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,
and they came to Hebron at break of day.

3:1 Now @ was long war between the @ of Saul and the @ of
@: but @ waxed stronger and stronger, and the @ of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker.

3:2 And unto @ were sons born in Hebron: and his @Oborn was
Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3:3 And his second, Chileab, of
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the
son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 3:4 And the
fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son
of Abital; 3:5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah @'s wife. These
were born to @ in Hebron.

3:6 And it came to pass, while @ was war between the @ of Saul
and the @ of @, that Abner made @9 strong for the @
of Saul.

3:7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my @'s concubine?  3:8 Then was Abner very wroth for the @5 of
Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, @ @
 @ do shew
kindness this day unto the @ of Saul thy @, to his @3,
and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of
@, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this
woman?  3:9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD
hath sworn to @, even so I do to him; 3:10 To translate the
kingdom from the @ of Saul, and to set up the throne of @ over
@ and over @, from Dan even to Beersheba.

3:11 And he could not answer Abner a word @*, @ he feared
him.

3:12 And Abner sent messengers to @ on his behalf, @, Whose
is the land? @ also, Make thy league with me, and, @%, my
hand @ be with thee, to @( @+ all @ unto thee.

3:13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one @7
I require of thee, that is, Thou @ not see my face, except thou
@O @( Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

3:14 And @ sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, @,
Deliver me my wife Michal, @ I espoused to me for an @/
foreskins of the Philistines.

3:15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
Phaltiel the son of Laish.

3:16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
Bahurim.

Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

3:17 And Abner had communication with the elders of @, @, Ye
sought for @ in times past to be king over you: 3:18 Now then do
it: for the LORD hath spoken of @, @, By the hand of my
@< @ I will save my @ @ out of the hand of the
Philistines, and out of the hand of all @ enemies.

3:19 And Abner also @0 in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also
to @K in the ears of @ in Hebron all that seemed good to
@, and that seemed good to the whole @ of Benjamin.

3:20 So Abner came to @ to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
@ made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

3:21 And Abner said unto @, I will arise and go, and will gather
all @ unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with
thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that @ @ desireth.
And @ sent Abner away; and he went in @U.

3:22 And, @%, the @<s of @ and Joab came from pursuing a
troop, and @ in a @ spoil with them: but Abner was not with
@ in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in @U.

3:23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
Joab, @, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent
him away, and he is gone in @U.

3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
@%, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away,
and he is quite gone?  3:25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he
came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and
to know all that thou doest.

3:26 And when Joab was come out from @, he sent messengers @
Abner, @ @ him @* from the well of Sirah: but @ knew
it not.

3:27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
gate to @K with him quietly, and smote him @ @[ the fifth
rib, that he died, for the @I of Asahel his @X.

3:28 And @ward when @ @) it, he said, I and my kingdom are
guiltless @	 the LORD for ever from the @I of Abner the son of
Ner: 3:29 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his @'s
@; and let @ not fail from the @ of Joab one that hath an
issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth
on the @Q, or that lacketh @d.

3:30 So Joab, and Abishai his @X slew Abner, @ he had slain
@ @X Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

3:31 And @ said to Joab, and to all the @ that were with him,
Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn @	
Abner. And king @ @9 followed the bier.

3:32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
@;, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the @ wept.

3:33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
dieth?  3:34 Thy @D were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:
as a man falleth @	 wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
@ wept @* over him.

3:35 And when all the @ came to cause @ to eat meat while it
was yet day, @ sware, @, So do God to me, and more also, if I
taste @d, or ought else, till the sun be down.

3:36 And all the @ took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
whatsoever the king did pleased all the @.

3:37 For all the @ and all @ @[stood that day that it was
not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

3:38 And the king said unto his @<s, Know ye not that @ is a
prince and a @ man fallen this day in @?  3:39 And I am this
day weak, though anointed king; and @ men the sons of Zeruiah be
too hard for me: the LORD @ reward the doer of evil @$ to
his wickedness.

4:1 And when Saul's son @) that Abner was dead in Hebron, his @D
were feeble, and all the @ites were troubled.

4:2 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name
of the one was Baanah, and the name of the @C Rechab, the sons of
Rimmon a Beerothite, of the @ of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also
was reckoned to Benjamin.

4:3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners @
until this day.)  4:4 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was
lame of his feet. He was five @8 old when the tidings came of Saul
and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and
it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became
lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

4:5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
and came @+ the heat of the day to the @ of Ishbosheth, who lay
on a bed at noon.

4:6 And they came thither into the @a of the @, as though they
@L have fetched wheat; and they smote him @[ the fifth rib: and
Rechab and Baanah his @X escaped.

4:7 For when they came into the @, he lay on his bed in his
bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and
took his head, and gat them away @E the plain all night.

4:8 And they @ the head of Ishbosheth unto @ to Hebron, and
said to the king, @. the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul @
enemy, @ sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the
king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

4:9 And @ @> Rechab and Baanah his @X, the sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who
hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 4:10 When one told me,
@, @., Saul is dead, thinking to have @ good tidings, I
took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I @L
have @= him a reward for his tidings: 4:11 How much more, when
wicked men have slain a @ceous person in his own @ upon his
bed? @ I not @fore now require his @I of your hand, and
take you away from the @?  4:12 And @ @M his young men,
and they slew them, and cut off @ @D and @ feet, and hanged
them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

5:1 Then came all the tribes of @ to @ unto Hebron, and
@0, @, @., we are thy bone and thy @R.

5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
leddest out and @est in @: and the LORD said to thee, Thou
@ feed my @ @, and thou @ be a captain over @.

5:3 So all the elders of @ came to the king to Hebron; and king
@ made a league with them in Hebron @	 the LORD: and they
anointed @ king over @.

5:4 @ was thirty @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
forty @8.

5:5 In Hebron he reigned over @ @H @8 and six months: and in
@  he reigned thirty and @@ @8 over all @ and @.

5:6 And the king and his men went to @  unto the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of the land: @ @0 unto @, @, Except thou
take away the blind and the lame, thou @ not come in hither:
thinking, @ cannot come in hither.

5:7 Nevertheless @ took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the
city of @.

5:8 And @ said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated
of @'s soul, he @ be chief and captain. Wherefore they said,
The blind and the lame @ not come into the @.

5:9 So @ dwelt in the fort, and @, it the city of @. And
@ built round @+ from Millo and inward.

5:10 And @ went on, and grew @, and the LORD God of hosts was
with him.

5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to @, and cedar trees,
and carpenters, and masons: and they built @ an @.

5:12 And @ perceived that the LORD had established him king over
@, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his @ @'s
sake.

5:13 And @ took him more concubines and wives out of @ ,
@ he was come from Hebron: and @ were yet sons and daughters

5:14 And @ be the names of @J that were born unto him in

Eliada, and Eliphalet.

5:17 But when the Philistines @) that they had anointed @ king
over @, all the Philistines came up to seek @; and @
@) of it, and went down to the hold.

5:18 The Philistines also came and spread @T in the valley of
Rephaim.

5:19 And @ enquired of the LORD, @, Shall I go up to the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said
unto @, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
@ hand.

5:20 And @ came to Baalperazim, and @ smote them @, and
said, The LORD hath broken @ upon mine enemies @	 me, as the
breach of @Zs. @N he @, the name of that @'
Baalperazim.

5:21 And @ they left @ images, and @ and his men burned

5:22 And the Philistines came up yet @*, and spread @T in
the valley of Rephaim.

5:23 And when @ enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou @ not go
up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over @

the mulberry trees.

5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
of the mulberry trees, that then thou @ bestir thyself: for then
@ the LORD go out @	 thee, to smite the host of the
Philistines.

5:25 And @ did so, as the LORD had @M him; and smote the
Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

6:1 Again, @ ga@d @? all the chosen men of @,
thirty @:.

6:2 And @ arose, and went with all the @ that were with him
from Baale of @, to @( up from thence the ark of God, whose

the cherubims.

6:3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and @ it out of
the @ of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons
of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

6:4 And they @ it out of the @ of Abinadab @ was at
Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went @	 the ark.

6:5 And @ and all the @ of @ played @	 the LORD on
all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on
psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

6:6 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put @ his
hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 Uzzah; and God smote
him @ for his error; and @ he died by the ark of God.

6:8 And @ was displeased, @ the LORD had made a breach upon
Uzzah: and he @, the name of the @' Perezuzzah to this day.

6:9 And @ was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How @ the
ark of the LORD come to me?  6:10 So @ @L not remove the ark of
the LORD unto him into the city of @: but @ carried it aside
into the @ of Obededom the Gittite.

6:11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the @ of Obededom the
Gittite @@ months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his
@hold.

6:12 And it was told king @, @, The LORD hath blessed the
@ of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, @ of the
ark of God. So @ went and @ up the ark of God from the @
of Obededom into the city of @ with gladness.

6:13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had
gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

6:14 And @ danced @	 the LORD with all his @B; and @
was girded with a linen ephod.

6:15 So @ and all the @ of @ @ up the ark of the
LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

6:16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of @, Michal
Saul's daughter looked @E a window, and saw king @ leaping
and dancing @	 the LORD; and she despised him in her @.

6:17 And they @ in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his @',

@ offered @_ @&s and @U @&s @	 the LORD.

6:18 And as soon as @ had made an end of @& @_ @&s

6:19 And he dealt @ all the @, even @ the whole multitude
of @, as well to the women as men, to @ one a cake of @d,
and a good piece of @R, and a flagon of wine. So all the @
departed @ one to his @.

6:20 Then @ returned to bless his @hold. And Michal the
daughter of Saul came out to meet @, and said, How glorious was
the king of @ to day, who uncovered @9 to day in the eyes of
the handmaids of his @<s, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
uncovereth @9!  6:21 And @ said unto Michal, It was @	
the LORD, @ chose me @	 thy @, and @	 all his @,
to appoint me ruler over the @ of the LORD, over @:
@fore will I play @	 the LORD.

6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine

@ I be had in honour.

6:23 @N Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day
of her @^.

7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his @, and the LORD
had @= him rest round @+ from all his enemies; 7:2 That the king
said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an @ of cedar,
but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in @ @;
for the LORD is with thee.

7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
unto Nathan, @, 7:5 Go and tell my @< @, Thus @
 the
LORD, Shalt thou build me an @ for me to dwell in?  7:6 Whereas I

And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
@ enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a @ name, like

7:10 Moreover I will appoint a @' for my @ @, and will

7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou @ sleep with thy

7:16 And @ @ and thy kingdom @ be established for ever

7:17 According to all @ @5, and @$ to all this vision,
so did Nathan @K unto @.

7:18 Then went king @ in, and sat @	 the LORD, and he said,
Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my @, that thou hast @ me

7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning

7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, @, The LORD of hosts

7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of @, hast revealed to thy

8:1 And @ this it came to pass that @ smote the Philistines,
and subdued them: and @ took Methegammah out of the hand of the
Philistines.

8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to @^,
and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became
@'s @<s, and @ gifts.

8:3 @ smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

8:4 And @ took from him a @: chariots, and @H @/
horsemen, and twenty @: footmen: and @ houghed all the
chariot horses, but reserved of them for an @/ chariots.

8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
Zobah, @ slew of the Syrians two and twenty @: men.

8:6 Then @ put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
became @<s to @, and @ gifts. And the LORD preserved
@ whithersoever he went.

8:7 And @ took the shields of gold that were on the @<s of
Hadadezer, and @ them to @ .

8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, @G of Hadadezer, king @
took exceeding much brass.

8:9 When Toi king of Hamath @) that @ had smitten all the host
of Hadadezer, 8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king @, to
salute him, and to bless him, @ he had fought @
 Hadadezer,
and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram @
with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
8:11 Which also king @ did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver
and gold that he had dedicated of all nations @ he subdued; 8:12
Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the @ of Ammon, and of the
Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of
Rehob, king of Zobah.

8:13 And @ gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen @: men.

8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; @Eout all Edom put he
garrisons, and all they of Edom became @'s @<s. And the LORD
preserved @ whithersoever he went.

8:15 And @ reigned over all @; and @ executed judgment
and justice unto all his @.

8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud was recorder; 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the @6s; and Seraiah was the
scribe; 8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the
Cherethites and the Pelethites; and @'s sons were chief rulers.

9:1 And @ said, Is @ yet any that is left of the @ of
Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?  9:2 And @
was of the @ of Saul a @< whose name was Ziba. And when they
had @, him unto @, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And
he said, Thy @< is he.

9:3 And the king said, Is @ not yet any of the @ of Saul, that
I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,
Jonathan hath yet a son, @ is lame on his feet.

9:4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the
king, @., he is in the @ of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in
Lodebar.

9:5 Then king @ sent, and fetched him out of the @ of Machir,
the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
come unto @, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And @
said, Mephibosheth. And he @>, @. thy @<!  9:7 And
@ said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness
for Jonathan thy @'s sake, and will restore thee all the land of
Saul thy @; and thou @ eat @d at my table continually.

9:8 And he bowed @9, and said, What is thy @<, that thou
@#est look upon such a dead dog as I am?  9:9 Then the king @,
to Ziba, Saul's @<, and said unto him, I have @= unto thy
master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his @.

9:10 Thou @fore, and thy sons, and thy @<s, @ till the
land for him, and thou @ @( in the fruits, that thy master's
son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son @ eat
@d alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
@<s.

9:11 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the
king hath @M his @<, so @ thy @< do. As for
Mephibosheth, said the king, he @ eat at my table, as one of the
king's sons.

9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all
that dwelt in the @ of Ziba were @<s unto Mephibosheth.

9:13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in @ : for he did eat continually at
the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

10:1 And it came to pass @ this, that the king of the @ of
Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

10:2 Then said @, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, as his @ shewed kindness unto me. And @ sent to
comfort him by the hand of his @<s for his @. And @'s
@<s came into the land of the @ of Ammon.

10:3 And the princes of the @ of Ammon said unto Hanun @
lord, Thinkest thou that @ doth honour thy @, that he hath
sent comforters unto thee? hath not @ rather sent his @<s
unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
10:4 Wherefore Hanun took @'s @<s, and shaved off the one
half of @ beards, and cut off @ garments in the middle, even
to @ buttocks, and sent them away.

10:5 When they told it unto @, he sent to meet them, @ the
men were @ly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until
your beards be grown, and then return.

10:6 And when the @ of Ammon saw that they stank @	 @,
the @ of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the
Syrians of Zoba, twenty @: footmen, and of king Maacah a
@: men, and of Ishtob twelve @: men.

10:7 And when @ @) of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
@By men.

10:8 And the @ of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,
and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by @T in the field.

10:9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was @
 him @	
and behind, he chose of all the choice men of @, and put them in
array @
 the Syrians: 10:10 And the rest of the @ he
delivered into the hand of Abishai his @X, that he @B put them
in array @
 the @ of Ammon.

10:11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
@ help me: but if the @ of Ammon be too strong for thee,
then I will come and help thee.

10:12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our @, and
for the @G of our God: and the LORD do that @ seemeth him
good.

10:13 And Joab drew nigh, and the @ that were with him, unto the
battle @
 the Syrians: and they fled @	 him.

10:14 And when the @ of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
then fled they also @	 Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab
returned from the @ of Ammon, and came to @ .

10:15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten @	 @,
they ga@d @T @?.

10:16 And Hadarezer sent, and @ out the Syrians that were beyond
the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host
of Hadarezer went @	 them.

10:17 And when it was told @, he ga@d all @ @?, and
passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set @T
in array @
 @, and fought with him.

10:18 And the Syrians fled @	 @; and @ slew the men of
@H @/ chariots of the Syrians, and forty @: horsemen,
and smote Shobach the captain of @ host, who died @.

10:19 And when all the kings that were @<s to Hadarezer saw that
they were smitten @	 @, they made @U with @, and
served them. So the Syrians feared to help the @ of Ammon any
more.

11:1 And it came to pass, @ the year was expired, at the time when
kings go @ to battle, that @ sent Joab, and his @<s with
him, and all @; and they destroyed the @ of Ammon, and
besieged Rabbah. But @ tarried still at @ .

11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that @ arose from off
his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's @: and from the
roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful
to look upon.

11:3 And @ sent and enquired @ the woman. And one said, Is not
this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
11:4 And @ sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness:
and she returned unto her @.

11:5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told @, and said, I am
with child.

11:6 And @ sent to Joab, @, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
Joab sent Uriah to @.

11:7 And when Uriah was come unto him, @ demanded of him how Joab
did, and how the @ did, and how the war prospered.

11:8 And @ said to Uriah, Go down to thy @, and wash thy feet.
And Uriah departed out of the king's @, and @ followed him a
mess of meat from the king.

11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's @ with all the
@<s of his lord, and went not down to his @.

11:10 And when they had told @, @, Uriah went not down unto
his @, @ said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?
why then didst thou not go down unto @ @?  11:11 And Uriah
said unto @, The ark, and @, and @, abide in tents; and
my lord Joab, and the @<s of my lord, are encamped in the open
fields; @ I then go into mine @, to eat and to @b, and to
lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not
do this @7.

11:12 And @ said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in @  that day, and the
morrow.

11:13 And when @ had @, him, he did eat and @b @	 him;
and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with
the @<s of his lord, but went not down to his @.

11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, that @ wrote a letter to
Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

11:15 And he wrote in the letter, @, Set ye Uriah in the
forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may
be smitten, and die.

11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
assigned Uriah unto a @' where he knew that valiant men were.

11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
@ fell some of the @ of the @<s of @; and Uriah the
Hittite died also.

11:18 Then Joab sent and told @ all the @ concerning the war;
11:19 And charged the messenger, @, When thou hast made an end of
telling the matters of the war unto the king, 11:20 And if so be that
the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye
so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they @L
shoot from the wall?  11:21 Who smote Abimelech the son of
Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him
from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then
say thou, Thy @< Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

11:22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed @ all that Joab
had sent him for.

11:23 And the messenger said unto @, Surely the men prevailed
@
 us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them
even unto the entering of the gate.

11:24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy @<s; and
some of the king's @<s be dead, and thy @< Uriah the Hittite
is dead also.

11:25 Then @ said unto the messenger, Thus @ thou say unto
Joab, Let not this @7 displease thee, for the @Q devoureth one
as well as @F: make thy battle more strong @
 the city, and
overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

11:26 And when the wife of Uriah @) that Uriah her husband was
dead, she mourned for her husband.

11:27 And when the mourning was past, @ sent and fetched her to
his @, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the @7
that @ had done displeased the LORD.

12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto @. And he came unto him, and
said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the
@C poor.

12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the
poor man had no@7, save one little ewe lamb, @ he had bought
and nourished up: and it grew up @? with him, and with his
@; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and
lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

12:4 And @ came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed
it for the man that was come to him.

12:5 And @'s anger was @ly kindled @
 the man; and he
said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this @7
@ surely die: 12:6 And he @ restore the lamb fourfold, @
he did this @7, and @ he had no pity.

12:7 And Nathan said to @, Thou art the man. Thus @
 the LORD
God of @, I anointed thee king over @, and I delivered thee
out of the hand of Saul; 12:8 And I gave thee thy master's @, and
thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the @ of @
and of @; and if that had been too little, I @L moreover have
@= unto thee such and such @.

12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the @Q,
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the
@Q of the @ of Ammon.

12:10 Now @fore the @Q @ never depart from @ @;
@ thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
Hittite to be thy wife.

12:11 Thus @
 the LORD, @., I will raise up evil @
 thee
out of @ own @, and I will take thy wives @	 @ eyes,
and give them unto thy neighbour, and he @ lie with thy wives in
the sight of this sun.

12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this @7 @	 all
@, and @	 the sun.

12:13 And @ said unto Nathan, I have sinned @
 the LORD. And
Nathan said unto @, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou
@ not die.

12:14 Howbeit, @ by this deed thou hast @= @ occasion to
the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto
thee @ surely die.

12:15 And Nathan departed unto his @. And the LORD struck the
child that Uriah's wife bare unto @, and it was very sick.

12:16 @ @fore besought God for the child; and @ fasted,
and went in, and lay all night upon the @.

12:17 And the elders of his @ arose, and went to him, to raise him
up from the @: but he @L not, @" did he eat @d with
them.

12:18 And it came to pass on the @Hth day, that the child died. And
the @<s of @ feared to tell him that the child was dead: for
they said, @., while the child was yet alive, we @0 unto him,
and he @L not hearken unto our @;: how will he then vex @9,
if we tell him that the child is dead?  12:19 But when @ saw that
his @<s whispered, @ perceived that the child was dead:
@fore @ said unto his @<s, Is the child dead? And they
said, He is dead.

12:20 Then @ arose from the @, and washed, and anointed
@9, and changed his apparel, and came into the @ of the LORD,
and worshipped: then he came to his own @; and when he required,
they set @d @	 him, and he did eat.

12:21 Then said his @<s unto him, What @7 is this that thou
hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat @d.

12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the
child may live?  12:23 But now he is dead, wherefore @# I fast?
can I @( him back @*? I @ go to him, but he @ not return
to me.

12:24 And @ comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he @, his name Solomon:
and the LORD loved him.

12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he @, his
name Jedidiah, @ of the LORD.

12:26 And Joab fought @
 Rabbah of the @ of Ammon, and
took the royal city.

12:27 And Joab sent messengers to @, and said, I have fought
@
 Rabbah, and have taken the city of @Zs.

12:28 Now @fore gather the rest of the @ @?, and encamp
@
 the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be @,
@ my name.

12:29 And @ ga@d all the @ @?, and went to Rabbah,
and fought @
 it, and took it.

12:30 And he took @ king's crown from off his head, the weight
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set
on @'s head. And he @ @ the spoil of the city in @
abundance.

12:31 And he @ @ the @ that were @in, and put them
@[ saws, and @[ harrows of iron, and @[ axes of iron, and
made them pass @E the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the
@G of the @ of Ammon. So @ and all the @ returned
unto @ .

13:1 And it came to pass @ this, that Absalom the son of @ had
a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of @ loved
her.

13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any@7
to her.

13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
Shimeah @'s @X: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

13:4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I
love Tamar, my @X Absalom's sister.

13:5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
thyself sick: and when thy @ cometh to see thee, say unto him, I
pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the
meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

13:6 So Amnon lay down, and made @9 sick: and when the king was
come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my
sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat
at her hand.

13:7 Then @ sent home to Tamar, @, Go now to thy @X
Amnon's @, and dress him meat.

13:8 So Tamar went to her @X Amnon's @; and he was laid down.
And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and
did bake the cakes.

13:9 And she took a pan, and poured them out @	 him; but he
refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they
went out @ man from him.

13:10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that
I may eat of @ hand. And Tamar took the cakes @ she had made,
and @ them into the chamber to Amnon her @X.

13:11 And when she had @ them unto him to eat, he took hold of
her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

13:12 And she @> him, Nay, my @X, do not force me; for no
such @7 ought to be done in @: do not thou this folly.

13:13 And I, whither @ I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
thou @ be as one of the fools in @. Now @fore, I pray
thee, @K unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

13:14 Howbeit he @L not hearken unto her @;: but, being stronger
than she, forced her, and lay with her.

13:15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
he hated her was @er than the love wherewith he had loved her. And
Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

13:16 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
me away is @er than the @C that thou didst unto me. But he
@L not hearken unto her.

13:17 Then he @, his @< that ministered unto him, and said,
Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door @ her.

13:18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his
@< @ her out, and bolted the door @ her.

13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on
crying.

13:20 And Absalom her @X said unto her, Hath Amnon thy @X
been with thee? but hold now thy @U, my sister: he is thy @X;
regard not this @7. So Tamar remained desolate in her @X
Absalom's @.

13:21 But when king @ @) of all @ @, he was very
wroth.

13:22 And Absalom @0 unto his @X Amnon @" good nor bad:
for Absalom hated Amnon, @ he had forced his sister Tamar.

13:23 And it came to pass @ two full @8, that Absalom had
sheepshearers in Baalhazor, @ is beside Ephraim: and Absalom
invited all the king's sons.

13:24 And Absalom came to the king, and said, @. now, thy @<
hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his @<s go
with thy @<.

13:25 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he
@L not go, but blessed him.

13:26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my @X Amnon go
with us. And the king said unto him, Why @# he go with thee?
13:27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
sons go with him.

13:28 Now Absalom had @M his @<s, @, Mark ye now when
Amnon's @ is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite
Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I @M you? be
courageous, and be valiant.

13:29 And the @<s of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
@M.

Then all the king's sons arose, and @ man gat him up upon his
mule, and fled.

13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
came to @, @, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and
@ is not one of them left.

13:31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
@; and all his @<s stood by with @ clothes rent.

13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah @'s @X, @> and
said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men
the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of
Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his
sister Tamar.

13:33 Now @fore let not my lord the king take the @7 to his
@, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is
dead.

13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
up his eyes, and looked, and, @%, @ came much @ by the
way of the hill side behind him.

13:35 And Jonadab said unto the king, @., the king's sons come: as
thy @< said, so it is.

13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of @King,
that, @%, the king's sons came, and lifted up @ @; and
wept: and the king also and all his @<s wept very sore.

13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
of Geshur. And @ mourned for his son @ day.

13:38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was @ @@ @8.

13:39 And the soul of king @ longed to go @ unto Absalom: for
he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's @ was
toward Absalom.

14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on
now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 14:3 And come to the
king, and @K on this manner unto him. So Joab put the @5 in her
@P.

14:4 And when the woman of Tekoah @0 to the king, she fell on her
face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

14:5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she @>, I
am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

14:6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove @? in
the field, and @ was none to part them, but the one smote the
@C, and slew him.

14:7 And, @%, the whole family is risen @
 @ handmaid,
and they said, Deliver him that smote his @X, that we may kill
him, for the life of his @X whom he slew; and we will destroy the
heir also: and so they @ quench my coal @ is left, and @
not leave to my husband @" name nor remainder upon the @.

14:8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to @ @, and I will
give charge concerning thee.

14:9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
iniquity be on me, and on my @'s @: and the king and his
throne be guiltless.

14:10 And the king said, Whoever @
 ought unto thee, @( him to
me, and he @ not touch thee any more.

14:11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
God, that thou @Lest not suffer the revengers of @I to destroy
any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
@ @ not one hair of thy son fall to the @.

14:12 Then the woman said, Let @ handmaid, I pray thee, @K one
word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

14:13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
@7 @
 the @ of God? for the king doth @K this @7 as
one @ is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home @* his
banished.

14:14 For we must needs die, and are as @Z spilt on the ground,
@ cannot be ga@d up @*; @" doth God respect any
person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled
from him.

14:15 Now @fore that I am come to @K of this @7 unto my lord
the king, it is @ the @ have made me afraid: and thy
handmaid said, I will now @K unto the king; it may be that the king
will perform the request of his handmaid.

14:16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
of the man that @L destroy me and my son @? out of the
inheritance of God.

14:17 Then @ handmaid said, The word of my lord the king @ now
be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to
discern good and bad: @fore the LORD thy God will be with thee.

14:18 Then the king @> and said unto the woman, Hide not from
me, I pray thee, the @7 that I @ ask thee. And the woman said,
Let my lord the king now @K.

14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
this?  And the woman @> and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord
the king, none can turn to the @c hand or to the left from ought
that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy @< Joab, he bade me,
and he put all @ @5 in the @P of @ handmaid: 14:20 To
fetch @+ this form of speech hath thy @< Joab done this @7:
and my lord is wise, @$ to the wisdom of an angel of God, to
know all @ that are in the @.

14:21 And the king said unto Joab, @. now, I have done this @7:
go @fore, @( the young man Absalom @*.

14:22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed @9, and
thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy @< knoweth that I
have @V grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his @<.

14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and @ Absalom to
@ .

14:24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own @, and let him
not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own @, and saw not the
king's face.

14:25 But in all @ @ was none to be so much praised as
Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of
his head @ was no blemish in him.

14:26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at @ year's end
that he polled it: @ the hair was heavy on him, @fore he
polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two @/ shekels
@ the king's weight.

14:27 And unto Absalom @ were born @@ sons, and one daughter,
whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

14:28 So Absalom dwelt two full @8 in @ , and saw not the
king's face.

14:29 @N Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he @L not come to him: and when he sent @* the second time,
he @L not come.

14:30 @N he said unto his @<s, See, Joab's field is near
mine, and he hath barley @; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's
@<s set the field on fire.

14:31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his @, and said
unto him, Wherefore have thy @<s set my field on fire?  14:32 And
Absalom @> Joab, @., I sent unto thee, @, Come hither,
that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from
Geshur? it had been good for me to have been @ still: now
@fore let me see the king's face; and if @ be any iniquity in
me, let him kill me.

14:33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had @,
for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed @9 on his face to the
ground @	 the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

15:1 And it came to pass @ this, that Absalom prepared him
chariots and horses, and fifty men to run @	 him.

15:2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment, then Absalom @, unto him, and said, Of what
city art thou? And he said, Thy @< is of one of the tribes of
@.

15:3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and @c;
but @ is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

15:4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
that @ man @ hath any suit or cause @B come unto me, and I
@L do him justice!  15:5 And it was so, that when any man came nigh
to him to do him obeisance, he put @ his hand, and took him, and
kissed him.

15:6 And on this manner did Absalom to all @ that came to the
king for judgment: so Absalom stole the @s of the men of @.

15:7 And it came to pass @ forty @8, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, @ I have vowed unto
the LORD, in Hebron.

15:8 For thy @< vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
@, If the LORD @ @( me @* indeed to @ , then I
will serve the LORD.

15:9 And the king said unto him, Go in @U. So he arose, and went to
Hebron.

15:10 But Absalom sent spies @Eout all the tribes of @,
@, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye @
say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

15:11 And with Absalom went two @/ men out of @ , that
were @,; and they went in @ simplicity, and they knew not any
@7.

15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, @'s
counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the @ increased
continually with Absalom.

15:13 And @ came a messenger to @, @, The @s of the
men of @ are @ Absalom.

15:14 And @ said unto all his @<s that were with him at
@ , Arise, and let us flee; for we @ not else escape from
Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and @(
evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the @Q.

15:15 And the king's @<s said unto the king, @., thy @<s
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king @ appoint.

15:16 And the king went @, and all his @hold @ him. And
the king left ten women, @ were concubines, to keep the @.

15:17 And the king went @, and all the @ @ him, and
tarried in a @' that was far off.

15:18 And all his @<s passed on beside him; and all the
Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six @/
men @ came @ him from Gath, passed on @	 the king.

15:19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
also with us? return to thy @', and abide with the king: for thou
art a stranger, and also an exile.

15:20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, @# I this day make thee
go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and
take back thy @3: mercy and truth be with thee.

15:21 And Ittai @> the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
as my lord the king liveth, surely in what @' my lord the king
@ be, whether in @^ or life, even @ also will thy @<
be.

15:22 And @ said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
him.

15:23 And all the country wept with a loud @;, and all the @
passed over: the king also @9 passed over the brook Kidron, and
all the @ passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

15:24 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and
Abiathar went up, until all the @ had done passing out of the
city.

15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
city: if I @ find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will @( me
@*, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 15:26 But if he thus
say, I have no delight in thee; @%, here am I, let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him.

15:27 The king said also unto Zadok the @6, Art not thou a seer?
return into the city in @U, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy
son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

15:28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until @
come word from you to certify me.

15:29 Zadok @fore and Abiathar carried the ark of God @* to
@ : and they tarried @.

15:30 And @ went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he
went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the
@ that was with him covered @ man his head, and they went up,
weeping as they went up.

15:31 And one told @, @, Ahithophel is @ the conspirators
with Absalom. And @ said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
Ahithophel into foolishness.

15:32 And it came to pass, that when @ was come to the top of the
mount, where he worshipped God, @%, Hushai the Archite came to
meet him with his coat rent, and @ upon his head: 15:33 Unto whom
@ said, If thou passest on with me, then thou @ be a burden
unto me: 15:34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I
will be thy @<, O king; as I have been thy @'s @<
hitherto, so will I now also be thy @<: then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

15:35 And hast thou not @ with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
@6s?  @fore it @ be, that what @7 soever thou @
hear out of the king's @, thou @ tell it to Zadok and Abiathar
the @6s.

15:36 @., they have @ with them @ two sons, Ahimaaz
Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye @ send
unto me @ @7 that ye can hear.

15:37 So Hushai @'s friend came into the city, and Absalom came
into @ .

16:1 And when @ was a little past the top of the hill, @%,
Ziba the @< of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses
saddled, and upon them two @/ loaves of @d, and an @/
bunches of raisins, and an @/ of summer fruits, and a bottle of
wine.

16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by @? And Ziba
said, The asses be for the king's @hold to ride on; and the @d
and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as
be faint in the wilderness may @b.

16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said
unto the king, @., he abideth at @ : for he said, To day
@ the @ of @ restore me the kingdom of my @.

16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, @., @ are all that pertained
unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may
find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

16:5 And when king @ came to Bahurim, @%, thence came out a
man of the family of the @ of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son
of Gera: he came @, and cursed still as he came.

16:6 And he cast stones at @, and at all the @<s of king
@: and all the @ and all the @By men were on his @c
hand and on his left.

16:7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
@Iy man, and thou man of Belial: 16:8 The LORD hath returned upon
thee all the @I of the @ of Saul, in whose stead thou hast
reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
Absalom thy son: and, @%, thou art taken in thy mischief, @
thou art a @Iy man.

16:9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why @#
this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and
take off his head.

16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zeruiah?  so let him curse, @ the LORD hath said unto him, Curse
@. Who @ then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  16:11 And
@ said to Abishai, and to all his @<s, @., my son, @
came @ of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this
Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath
bidden him.

16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

16:13 And as @ and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
the hill's side over @
 him, and cursed as he went, and threw
stones at him, and cast dust.

16:14 And the king, and all the @ that were with him, came weary,
and refreshed @T @.

16:15 And Absalom, and all the @ the men of @, came to
@ , and Ahithophel with him.

16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, @'s friend,
was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the
king, God save the king.

16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?
why wentest thou not with thy friend?  16:18 And Hushai said unto
Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this @, and all the men of
@, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.

16:19 And @*, whom @# I serve? @# I not serve in the
presence of his son? as I have served in thy @'s presence, so
will I be in thy presence.

16:20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel @ you what we
@ do.

16:21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy @'s
concubines, @ he hath left to keep the @; and all @ @
hear that thou art abhorred of thy @: then @ the @D of all
that are with thee be strong.

16:22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the @; and
Absalom went in unto his @'s concubines in the sight of all
@.

16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, @ he counselled in @J
days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all
the counsel of Ahithophel both with @ and with Absalom.

17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
twelve @: men, and I will arise and pursue @ @ this
night: 17:2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak
handed, and will make him afraid: and all the @ that are with him
@ flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will @( back
all the @ unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned: so all the @ @ be in @U.

17:4 And the @ pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
@.

17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he @
.

17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom @0 unto him,
@, Ahithophel hath spoken @ this manner: @ we do @
his @? if not; @K thou.

17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
@= is not good at this time.

17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy @ and his men, that they
be @By men, and they be chafed in @ minds, as a bear robbed of
her whelps in the field: and thy @ is a man of war, and will not
lodge with the @.

17:9 @., he is hid now in some pit, or in some @C @': and it
will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the @O, that
whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter @ the @
that follow Absalom.

17:10 And he also that is valiant, whose @ is as the @ of a
lion, @ utterly melt: for all @ knoweth that thy @ is a
@By man, and they @ be with him are valiant men.

17:11 @N I counsel that all @ be generally ga@d unto
thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude; and that thou go to battle in @ own person.

17:12 So @ we come upon him in some @' where he @ be @V,
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of
him and of all the men that are with him @ @ not be left so
much as one.

17:13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then @ all @
@( ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until
@ be not one small stone @V @.

17:14 And Absalom and all the men of @ said, The counsel of
Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the
LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the
intent that the LORD @B @( evil upon Absalom.

17:15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the @6s, Thus
and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of @; and
thus and thus have I counselled.

17:16 Now @fore send quickly, and tell @, @, Lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;
lest the king be swallowed up, and all the @ that are with him.

17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they @B not
be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and
they went and told king @.

17:18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
both of them away quickly, and came to a man's @ in Bahurim, @
had a well in his court; whither they went down.

17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's @P,
and spread ground corn @on; and the @7 was not known.

17:20 And when Absalom's @<s came to the woman to the @, they
said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,
They be gone over the brook of @Z. And when they had sought and
could not find them, they returned to @ .

17:21 And it came to pass, @ they were departed, that they came up
out of the well, and went and told king @, and said unto @,
Arise, and pass quickly over the @Z: for thus hath Ahithophel
counselled @
 you.

17:22 Then @ arose, and all the @ that were with him, and
they passed over Jordan: by the morning light @ lacked not one of
them that was not gone over Jordan.

17:23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his @, to his
city, and put his @hold in order, and hanged @9, and died,
and was buried in the sepulchre of his @.

17:24 Then @ came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
and all the men of @ with him.

17:25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
@ Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an @ite, that
went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's
m@C.

17:26 So @ and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

17:27 And it came to pass, when @ was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the @ of Ammon, and Machir the
son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
17:28 Brought beds, and basons, and @en vessels, and wheat, and
barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and
parched pulse, 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of
kine, for @, and for the @ that were with him, to eat: for
they said, The @ is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
wilderness.

18:1 And @ numbered the @ that were with him, and set
captains of @:s, and captains of @/s over them.

18:2 And @ sent @ a third part of the @ @[ the hand of
Joab, and a third part @[ the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
Joab's @X, and a third part @[ the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
And the king said unto the @, I will surely go @ with you
myself also.

18:3 But the @ @>, Thou @ not go @: for if we flee
away, they will not care for us; @" if half of us die, will they
care for us: but now thou art worth ten @: of us: @fore now
it is better that thou succour us out of the city.

18:4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And
the king stood by the gate side, and all the @ came out by
@/s and by @:s.

18:5 And the king @M Joab and Abishai and Ittai, @, Deal
gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the
@ @) when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
Absalom.

18:6 So the @ went out into the field @
 @: and the
battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 18:7 Where the @ of @
were slain @	 the @<s of @, and @ was @ a @
slaughter that day of twenty @: men.

18:8 For the battle was @ scattered over the face of all the
country: and the wood devoured more @ that day than the @Q
devoured.

18:9 And Absalom met the @<s of @. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went @[ the thick boughs of a @ oak, and his
head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the @1
and the @; and the mule that was @[ him went away.

18:10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, @., I saw
Absalom hanged in an oak.

18:11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, @%, thou
sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him @ to the ground? and
I @L have @= thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

18:12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I @# receive a @:
shekels of silver in mine hand, yet @L I not put @ mine hand
@
 the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and
Abishai and Ittai, @, Beware that none touch the young man
Absalom.

18:13 Otherwise I @# have wrought falsehood @
 mine own life:
for @ is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself @Lest
have set thyself @
 me.

18:14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
@@ darts in his hand, and thrust them @E the @ of Absalom,
while he was yet alive in the @a of the oak.

18:15 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed @+ and
smote Absalom, and slew him.

18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the @ returned from pursuing
@ @: for Joab held back the @.

18:17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a @ pit in the
wood, and laid a very @ heap of stones upon him: and all @
fled @ one to his tent.

18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for @9
a pillar, @ is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to
keep my name in remembrance: and he @, the pillar @ his own
name: and it is @, unto this day, Absalom's @'.

18:19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

18:20 And Joab said unto him, Thou @ not bear tidings this day,
but thou @ bear tidings @F day: but this day thou @ bear
no tidings, @ the king's son is dead.

18:21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
And Cushi bowed @9 unto Joab, and ran.

18:22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet @* to Joab, But
howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run @ Cushi. And Joab said,
Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings
ready?  18:23 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto
him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

18:24 And @ sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and @% a man running alone.

18:25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If
he be alone, @ is tidings in his @P. And he came apace, and
drew near.

18:26 And the watchman saw @F man running: and the watchman
@, unto the porter, and said, @. @F man running alone.
And the king said, He also @(eth tidings.

18:27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He
is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

18:28 And Ahimaaz @,, and said unto the king, All is well. And he
fell down to the @ upon his face @	 the king, and said,
Blessed be the LORD thy God, @ hath delivered up the men that
lifted up @ hand @
 my lord the king.

18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
@>, When Joab sent the king's @<, and me thy @<, I saw
a @ tumult, but I knew not what it was.

18:30 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
turned aside, and stood still.

18:31 And, @%, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
@
 thee.

18:32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
Cushi @>, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise
@
 thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

18:33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my
son, my son Absalom! @L God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!  19:1 And it was told Joab, @., the king weepeth and
mourneth for Absalom.

19:2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
@: for the @ @) say that day how the king was grieved for
his son.

19:3 And the @ gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
@ being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

19:4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
@;, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  19:5 And Joab
came into the @ to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day
the faces of all thy @<s, @ this day have saved thy life, and
the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy
wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 19:6 In that thou lovest @
enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that
thou regardest @" princes nor @<s: for this day I perceive,
that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had
pleased thee well.

19:7 Now @fore arise, go @, and @K comfortably unto thy
@<s: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not @, @ will
not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all
the @, @, @., the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
@ came @	 the king: for @ had fled @ man to his
tent.

19:9 And all the @ were at strife @Eout all the tribes of
@, @, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and
he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled
out of the land for Absalom.

19:10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
@fore why @K ye not a word of @(ing the king back?  19:11
And king @ sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the @6s, @,
Speak unto the elders of @, @, Why are ye the last to @(
the king back to his @? seeing the speech of all @ is come to
the king, even to his @.

19:12 Ye are my @3, ye are my bones and my @R: wherefore then
are ye the last to @( back the king?  19:13 And say ye to Amasa,
Art thou not of my bone, and of my @R? God do so to me, and more
also, if thou be not captain of the host @	 me continually in the
room of Joab.

19:14 And he bowed the @ of all the men of @, even as the
@ of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return
thou, and all thy @<s.

19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And @ came to
Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, @ was of Bahurim,
hasted and came down with the men of @ to meet king @.

19:17 And @ were a @: men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
@< of the @ of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty
@<s with him; and they went over Jordan @	 the king.

19:18 And @ went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
@hold, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera
fell down @	 the king, as he was come over Jordan; 19:19 And said
unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, @" do
thou remember that @ thy @< did perversely the day that my
lord the king went out of @ , that the king @# take it to
his @.

19:20 For thy @< doth know that I have sinned: @fore, @%,
I am come the @O this day of all the @ of Joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king.

19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah @> and said, Shall not
Shimei be put to @^ for this, @ he cursed the LORD's
anointed?  19:22 And @ said, What have I to do with you, ye sons
of Zeruiah, that ye @# this day be adversaries unto me? @
@ any man be put to @^ this day in @? for do not I know
that I am this day king over @?  19:23 @N the king said
unto Shimei, Thou @ not die. And the king sware unto him.

19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and
had @" dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his
clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came @* in
@U.

19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come to @  to meet the
king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
Mephibosheth?  19:26 And he @>, My lord, O king, my @<
deceived me: for thy @< said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may
ride @on, and go to the king; @ thy @< is lame.

19:27 And he hath slandered thy @< unto my lord the king; but my
lord the king is as an angel of God: do @fore what is good in
@ eyes.

19:28 For all of my @'s @ were but dead men @	 my lord
the king: yet didst thou set thy @< @ them that did eat at
@ own table. What @c @fore have I yet to cry any more unto
the king?  19:29 And the king said unto him, Why @Kest thou any
more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

19:30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
forasmuch as my lord the king is come @* in @U unto his own
@.

19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

19:32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore @8 old: and
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for
he was a very @ man.

19:33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
will feed thee with me in @ .

19:34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that
I @# go up with the king unto @ ?  19:35 I am this day
fourscore @8 old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy
@< taste what I eat or what I @b? can I hear any more the
@; of singing men and singing women? wherefore then @# thy
@< be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  19:36 Thy @< will
go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why @# the king
recompense it me with such a reward?  19:37 Let thy @<, I pray
thee, turn back @*, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried
by the grave of my @ and of my m@C. But @% thy @<
Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what
@ seem good unto thee.

19:38 And the king @>, Chimham @ go over with me, and I will
do to him that @ @ seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou
@ require of me, that will I do for thee.

19:39 And all the @ went over Jordan. And when the king was come
over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto
his own @'.

19:40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
and all the @ of @ conducted the king, and also half the
@ of @.

19:41 And, @%, all the men of @ came to the king, and said
unto the king, Why have our @3 the men of @ stolen thee
away, and have @ the king, and his @hold, and all @'s
men with him, over Jordan?  19:42 And all the men of @ @>
the men of @, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore
then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's
cost? or hath he @= us any gift?  19:43 And the men of @
@> the men of @, and said, We have ten parts in the king,
and we have also more @c in @ than ye: why then did ye despise
us, that our advice @# not be @O had in @(ing back our king?
And the @5 of the men of @ were fiercer than the @5 of the
men of @.

20:1 And @ happened to be @ a man of Belial, whose name was
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and
said, We have no part in @, @" have we inheritance in the son
of Jesse: @ man to his tents, O @.

20:2 So @ man of @ went up from @ @, and followed
Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of @ clave unto @ king,
from Jordan even to @ .

20:3 And @ came to his @ at @ ; and the king took the
ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the @, and put
them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were
shut up unto the day of @ @^, living in widowhood.

20:4 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of @ within
@@ days, and be thou here present.

20:5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of @: but he tarried longer
than the set time @ he had appointed him.

20:6 And @ said to Abishai, Now @ Sheba the son of Bichri do
us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's @<s, and
pursue @ him, lest he get him fenced @G, and escape us.

20:7 And @ went out @ him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and
the Pelethites, and all the @By men: and they went out of
@ , to pursue @ Sheba the son of Bichri.

20:8 When they were at the @ stone @ is in Gibeon, Amasa went
@	 them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto
him, and upon it a girdle with a @Q fastened upon his loins in the
sheath @of; and as he went @ it fell out.

20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my @X? And Joab
took Amasa by the beard with the @c hand to kiss him.

20:10 But Amasa took no heed to the @Q that was in Joab's hand: so
he smote him @with in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to
the ground, and struck him not @*; and he died. So Joab and Abishai
his @X pursued @ Sheba the son of Bichri.

20:11 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
Joab, and he that is for @, let him go @ Joab.

20:12 And Amasa wallowed in @I in the @a of the highway. And
when the man saw that all the @ stood still, he removed Amasa out
of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw
that @ one that came by him stood still.

20:13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the @ went on
@ Joab, to pursue @ Sheba the son of Bichri.

20:14 And he went @E all the tribes of @ unto Abel, and to
Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were ga@d @?, and
went also @ him.

20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they
cast up a bank @
 the city, and it stood in the trench: and all
the @ that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

20:16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may @K with thee.

20:17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou

20:19 I am one of them that are @Uable and faithful in @: thou

20:21 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son

 the king, even
@
 @: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And
the woman said unto Joab, @., his head @ be thrown to thee

20:22 Then the woman went unto all the @ in her wisdom. And they
cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.
And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, @ man to

20:23 Now Joab was over all the host of @: and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 20:24 And
Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was
recorder: 20:25 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the

21:3 Wherefore @ said unto the Gibeonites, What @ I do for

21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of

21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it

21:12 And @ went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of

21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war @* with @; and

22:1 And @ @0 unto the LORD the @5 of this song in the day

22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so @ I

22:5 When the waves of @^ compassed me, the floods of ungodly men

22:8 Then the @ shook and trembled; the @Vations of @1

22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his

22:10 He bowed the @1s also, and came down; and darkness was @[

22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the

22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round @+ him, dark @Zs, and

22:13 Through the b@cness @	 him were coals of fire kindled.

22:14 The LORD th@[ed from @1, and the most High uttered his

22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and

22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the @Vations of the

22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many @Zs;
22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated

22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my

22:20 He @ me @ also into a large @': he delivered me,

22:21 The LORD rewarded me @$ to my @ceousness: @$ to

22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my

22:30 For by thee I have run @E a troop: by my God have I leaped

22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high

22:35 He teacheth my @D to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by

22:36 Thou hast also @= me the shield of thy salvation: and thy

22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps @[ me; so that my feet did not

22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not

22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not

22:42 They looked, but @ was none to save; even unto the LORD, but

22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the @, I did

22:50 @N I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, @ the

1:21 Otherwise it @ come to pass, when my lord the king @
sleep with his @s, that I and my son Solomon @ be counted
offenders.

1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
also came in.

1:23 And they told the king, @, @. Nathan the prophet. And
when he was come in @	 the king, he bowed @9 @	 the king
with his face to the ground.

1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah @
reign @ me, and he @ sit upon my throne?  1:25 For he is gone
down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
abundance, and hath @, all the king's sons, and the captains of
the host, and Abiathar the @6; and, @%, they eat and @b

1:26 But me, even me thy @<, and Zadok the @6, and Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, and thy @< Solomon, hath he not @,.

1:27 Is this @7 done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy @<, who @# sit on the throne of my lord the king
@ him?  1:28 Then king @ @> and said, Call me Bathsheba.
And she came into the king's presence, and stood @	 the king.

1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress, 1:30 Even as I sware unto thee
by the LORD God of @, @, Assuredly Solomon thy son @
reign @ me, and he @ sit upon my throne in my stead; even so
will I certainly do this day.

1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the @, and did
reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king @ live for ever.

1:32 And king @ said, Call me Zadok the @6, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came @	 the
king.

1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the @<s of your
lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and @(
him down to Gihon: 1:34 And let Zadok the @6 and Nathan the
prophet anoint him @ king over @: and blow ye with the
trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.

1:35 Then ye @ come up @ him, that he may come and sit upon my
throne; for he @ be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to
be ruler over @ and over @.

1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada @> the king, and said,
Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
Solomon, and make his throne @er than the throne of my lord king
@.

1:38 So Zadok the @6, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and
caused Solomon to ride upon king @'s mule, and @ him to
Gihon.

1:39 And Zadok the @6 took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the @
said, God save king Solomon.

1:40 And all the @ came up @ him, and the @ piped with
pipes, and rejoiced with @ joy, so that the @ rent with the
sound of them.

1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him @) it as
they had made an end of eating. And when Joab @) the sound of the
trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
uproar?  1:42 And while he yet @0, @%, Jonathan the son of
Abiathar the @6 came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for
thou art a valiant man, and @(est good tidings.

1:43 And Jonathan @> and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
@ hath made Solomon king.

1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the @6, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the
Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1:45 And Zadok the @6 and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the
city rang @*. This is the noise that ye have @).

1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

1:47 And moreover the king's @<s came to bless our lord king
@, @, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and
make his throne @er than thy throne. And the king bowed @9
upon the bed.

1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of @,
@ hath @= one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even
seeing it.

1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
up, and went @ man his way.

1:50 And Adonijah feared @ of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
caught hold on the horns of the @\.

1:51 And it was told Solomon, @, @., Adonijah feareth king
Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the @\,
@, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his
@< with the @Q.

1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew @9 a worthy man, @
@ not an hair of him fall to the @: but if wickedness @ be
@V in him, he @ die.

1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they @ him down from the @\.
And he came and bowed @9 to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto
him, Go to @ @.

2:1 Now the days of @ drew nigh that he @# die; and he charged
Solomon his son, @, 2:2 I go the way of all the @: be thou
strong @fore, and shew thyself a man; 2:3 And keep the charge of
the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his
commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written
in the law of @, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,
and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 2:4 That the LORD may continue
his word @ he @0 concerning me, @, If thy @ take
heed to @ way, to walk @	 me in truth with all @ @ and
with all @ soul, @ @ not fail thee (said he) a man on the

2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of @, unto Abner
the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and
shed the @I of war in @U, and put the @I of war upon his
girdle that was @+ his loins, and in his shoes that were on his
feet.

2:6 Do @fore @$ to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
down to the grave in @U.

2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
let them be of @J that eat at thy table: for so they came to me
when I fled @ of Absalom thy @X.

2:8 And, @%, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
Benjamite of Bahurim, @ cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I
sware to him by the LORD, @, I will not put thee to @^ with
the @Q.

2:9 Now @fore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head @(

2:10 So @ slept with his @s, and was buried in the city of
@.

2:11 And the days that @ reigned over @ were forty @8:
@H @8 reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and @@ @8 reigned
he in @ .

2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of @ his @; and his
kingdom was established @ly.

2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the m@C of
Solomon. And she said, Comest thou @Uably? And he said, Peaceably.

2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
Say on.

2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
@ set @ faces on me, that I @# reign: howbeit the kingdom
is turned @+, and is become my @X's: for it was his from the
LORD.

2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
unto him, Say on.

2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to
wife.

2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will @K for thee unto the king.

2:19 Bathsheba @fore went unto king Solomon, to @K unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed @9 unto
her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the
king's m@C; and she sat on his @c hand.

2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my m@C: for I
will not say thee nay.

2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be @= to Adonijah thy
@X to wife.

2:22 And king Solomon @> and said unto his m@C, And why dost
thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom
also; for he is mine elder @X; even for him, and for Abiathar the
@6, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, @, God do so to me, and
more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word @
 his own life.

2:24 Now @fore, as the LORD liveth, @ hath established me, and
set me on the throne of @ my @, and who hath made me an
@, as he promised, Adonijah @ be put to @^ this day.

2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
and he fell upon him that he died.

2:26 And unto Abiathar the @6 said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
unto @ own fields; for thou art worthy of @^: but I will not at
this time put thee to @^, @ thou barest the ark of the LORD
God @	 @ my @, and @ thou hast been afflicted in
all wherein my @ was afflicted.

2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being @6 unto the LORD;
that he @B fulfil the word of the LORD, @ he @0 concerning
the @ of Eli in Shiloh.

2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned @ Adonijah,
though he turned not @ Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle
of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the @\.

2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
tabernacle of the LORD; and, @%, he is by the @\. Then Solomon
sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, @, Go, fall upon him.

2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
him, Thus @
 the king, Come @. And he said, Nay; but I will die
here. And Benaiah @ the king word @*, @, Thus said Joab,
and thus he @> me.

2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent @I,
@ Joab shed, from me, and from the @ of my @.

2:32 And the LORD @ return his @I upon his own head, who fell
upon two men more @ceous and better than he, and slew them with the
@Q, my @ @ not knowing @of, to wit, Abner the son of
Ner, captain of the host of @, and Amasa the son of Jether,
captain of the host of @.

2:33 Their @I @ @fore return upon the head of Joab, and
upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon @, and upon his seed,
and upon his @, and upon his throne, @ @ be @U for ever
from the LORD.

2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
slew him: and he was buried in his own @ in the wilderness.

2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
host: and Zadok the @6 did the king put in the room of Abiathar.

2:36 And the king sent and @, for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
thee an @ in @ , and dwell @, and go not @ thence
any whither.

2:37 For it @ be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
the brook Kidron, thou @ know for certain that thou @ surely
die: thy @I @ be upon @ own head.

2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The @ is good: as my lord the
king hath said, so will thy @< do. And Shimei dwelt in @ 
many days.

2:39 And it came to pass at the end of @@ @8, that two of the
@<s of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.
And they told Shimei, @, @., thy @<s be in Gath.

2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish
to seek his @<s: and Shimei went, and @ his @<s from
Gath.

2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from @  to
Gath, and was come @*.

2:42 And the king sent and @, for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, @,
Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou @ surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have @) is good.

2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
commandment that I have charged thee with?  2:44 The king said
moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness @ @ @
is privy to, that thou didst to @ my @: @fore the LORD
@ return thy wickedness upon @ own head; 2:45 And king Solomon
@ be blessed, and the throne of @ @ be established @	
the LORD for ever.

2:46 So the king @M Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; @ went
out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established
in the hand of Solomon.

3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of @-, and took
Pharaoh's daughter, and @ her into the city of @, until he
had made an end of building his own @, and the @ of the LORD,
and the wall of @  round @+.

3:2 Only the @ sacrificed in high @'s, @ @ was no
@ built unto the name of the LORD, until @J days.

3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of @ his
@: only he sacrificed and @_ incense in high @'s.

3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice @; for that was the
@ high @': a @: @_ @&s did Solomon offer upon
that @\.

3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and
God said, Ask what I @ give thee.

3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy @< @ my
@ @ mercy, @$ as he walked @	 thee in truth, and
in @ceousness, and in up@cness of @ with thee; and thou hast
kept for him this @ kindness, that thou hast @= him a son to
sit on his throne, as it is this day.

3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy @< king instead of
@ my @: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out
or come in.

3:8 And thy @< is in the @a of thy @ @ thou hast
chosen, a @ @, that cannot be numbered nor counted for
multitude.

3:9 Give @fore thy @< an @[standing @ to judge thy
@, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to
judge this thy so @ a @?  3:10 And the speech pleased the
LORD, that Solomon had asked this @7.

3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this @7, and
hast not asked for thyself long life; @" hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of @ enemies; but hast asked for

3:13 And I have also @= thee that @ thou hast not asked, both

3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as thy @ @ did walk, then I will lengthen thy

3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, @%, it was a dream. And he came to
@ , and stood @	 the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and
offered up @_ @&s, and offered @U @&s, and made a
feast to all his @<s.

3:16 Then came @ two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
stood @	 him.

3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
@; and I was delivered of a child with her in the @.

3:18 And it came to pass the third day @ that I was delivered,
that this woman was delivered also: and we were @?; @ was no
stranger with us in the @, save we two in the @.

3:19 And this woman's child died in the night; @ she overlaid

3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
@ handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead
child in my bosom.

3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, @%, it
was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, @%, it was
not my son, @ I did bear.

3:22 And the @C woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the
living is my son. Thus they @0 @	 the king.

3:23 Then said the king, The one @
, This is my son that liveth,
and thy son is the dead: and the @C @
, Nay; but thy son is the
dead, and my son is the living.

3:24 And the king said, Bring me a @Q. And they @ a @Q
@	 the king.

3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
to the one, and half to the @C.

3:26 Then @0 the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her
the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the @C said, Let it
be @" mine nor @, but divide it.

3:27 Then the king @> and said, Give her the living child, and
in no wise slay it: she is the m@C @of.

3:28 And all @ @) of the judgment @ the king had judged;
and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in
him, to do judgment.

4:1 So king Solomon was king over all @.

4:2 And @ were the princes @ he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
the @6, 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
Abiathar were the @6s: 4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over
the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and
the king's friend: 4:6 And Ahishar was over the @hold: and
Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.

4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all @, @ provided
victuals for the king and his @hold: each man his month in a year
made provision.

4:8 And @ are @ names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and
Elonbethhanan: 4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained
Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 4:11 The son of Abinadab, in all

Aloth: 4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 4:18 Shimei
the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in the
country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and
of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer @ was in the
land.

4:20 @ and @ were many, as the sand @ is by the sea in

4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the Philistines, and unto the border of @-: they @
presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour, and @@score measures of meal, 4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty
oxen out of the pastures, and an @/ sheep, beside harts, and
roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:
and he had @U on all sides round @+ him.

4:25 And @ and @ dwelt safely, @ man @[ his vine and

Solomon.

4:26 And Solomon had forty @: stalls of horses for his chariots,
and twelve @: horsemen.

4:27 And @J officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all

lacked no@7.

4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries @ they

4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and @[standing exceeding much, and
largeness of @, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

4:30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the @ of
the east country, and all the wisdom of @-.

4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in
all nations round @+.

4:32 And he @0 @@ @: proverbs: and his songs were a

4:33 And he @0 of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he @0 also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping @, and of fishes.

4:34 And @ came of all @ to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
all kings of the @, @ had @) of his wisdom.

5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his @<s unto Solomon; for he had
@) that they had anointed him king in the room of his @: for
Hiram was ever a lover of @.

5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, @, 5:3 Thou knowest how that @
my @ could not build an @ unto the name of the LORD his God
for the wars @ were @+ him on @ side, until the LORD put

5:4 But now the LORD my God hath @= me rest on @ side, so that

5:6 Now @fore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of

5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram @) the @5 of Solomon, that
he rejoiced @ly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, @
hath @= unto @ a wise son over this @ @.

5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, @, I have considered the @

5:9 My @<s @ @( them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I

5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees @$ to all

5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty @: measures of wheat for food

to Hiram year by year.

5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and @

5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all @; and the levy

5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten @: a month by courses: a
month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was
over the levy.

5:15 And Solomon had @@score and ten @: that bare burdens,
and fourscore @: hewers in the mountains; 5:16 Beside the chief

@@ @/, @ ruled over the @ that wrought in the work.

5:17 And the king @M, and they @ @ stones, costly
stones, and hewed stones, to lay the @Vation of the @.

5:18 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the
stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the @.

6:1 And it came to pass in the four @/ and eightieth year @
the @ of @ were come out of the land of @-, in the
fourth year of Solomon's reign over @, in the month Zif, @ is
the second month, that he began to build the @ of the LORD.

6:2 And the @ @ king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
@of was @@score cubits, and the @dth @of twenty cubits,
and the height @of thirty cubits.

6:3 And the porch @	 the temple of the @, twenty cubits was
the length @of, @$ to the @dth of the @; and ten
cubits was the @dth @of @	 the @.

6:4 And for the @ he made windows of narrow lights.

6:5 And @
 the wall of the @ he built chambers round @+,
@
 the walls of the @ round @+, both of the temple and of
the oracle: and he made chambers round @+: 6:6 The nethermost
chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,
and the third was @H cubits broad: for @S in the wall of the
@ he made narrowed rests round @+, that the beams @# not be
fastened in the walls of the @.

6:7 And the @, when it was in building, was built of stone made
ready @	 it was @ thither: so that @ was @" hammer
nor axe nor any tool of iron @) in the @, while it was in
building.

6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the @c side of the
@: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,
and out of the middle into the third.

6:9 So he built the @, and finished it; and covered the @ with
beams and boards of cedar.

6:10 And then he built chambers @
 all the @, five cubits
high: and they rested on the @ with timber of cedar.

6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, @, 6:12 Concerning
this @ @ thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my
statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, @ I @0
unto @ thy @: 6:13 And I will dwell @ the @ of
@, and will not forsake my @ @.

6:14 So Solomon built the @, and finished it.

6:15 And he built the walls of the @ within with boards of cedar,
both the floor of the @, and the walls of the ceiling: and he
covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the
@ with planks of fir.

6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the @, both the
floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it
within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy @'.

6:17 And the @, that is, the temple @	 it, was forty cubits
long.

6:18 And the cedar of the @ within was carved with knops and open
flowers: all was cedar; @ was no stone seen.

6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the @ within, to set @ the
ark of the covenant of the LORD.

6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
twenty cubits in @dth, and twenty cubits in the height @of: and
he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the @\ @ was of
cedar.

6:21 So Solomon overlaid the @ within with pure gold: and he made
a partition by the chains of gold @	 the oracle; and he overlaid
it with gold.

6:22 And the whole @ he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the @: also the whole @\ that was by the oracle he overlaid
with gold.

6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
ten cubits high.

6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
the @C wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the @C were ten cubits.

6:25 And the @C cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of
one measure and one size.

6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
@C cherub.

6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner @: and they
stretched @ the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the
one touched the one wall, and the wing of the @C cherub touched the
@C wall; and @ wings touched one @F in the @a of the
@.

6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

6:29 And he carved all the walls of the @ round @+ with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
@S.

6:30 And the floors of the @ he overlaid with gold, within and
@S.

6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:
the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm
trees.

6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
fourth part of the wall.

6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
door were folding, and the two leaves of the @C door were folding.

6:35 And he carved @on cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.

6:36 And he built the inner court with @@ rows of hewed stone, and
a row of cedar beams.

6:37 In the fourth year was the @Vation of the @ of the LORD
laid, in the month Zif: 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month
Bul, @ is the eighth month, was the @ finished @Eout all
the parts @of, and @$ to all the fashion of it. So was he
@H @8 in building it.

7:1 But Solomon was building his own @ thirteen @8, and he
finished all his @.

7:2 He built also the @ of the forest of Lebanon; the length
@of was an @/ cubits, and the @dth @of fifty cubits,
and the height @of thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,
with cedar beams upon the pillars.

7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on
forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

7:4 And @ were windows in @@ rows, and light was @
 light
in @@ ranks.

7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
light was @
 light in @@ ranks.

7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length @of was fifty
cubits, and the @dth @of thirty cubits: and the porch was
@	 them: and the @C pillars and the thick beam were @	
them.

7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he @B judge, even the
porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
floor to the @C.

7:8 And his @ where he dwelt had @F court within the porch,
@ was of the like work. Solomon made also an @ for Pharaoh's
daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.

7:9 All @ were of costly stones, @$ to the measures of
hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and @S, even from the
@Vation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the @
court.

7:10 And the @Vation was of costly stones, even @ stones,
stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

7:11 And above were costly stones, @ the measures of hewed stones,
and cedars.

7:12 And the @ court round @+ was with @@ rows of hewed
stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the
@ of the LORD, and for the porch of the @.

7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

7:14 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his @ was
a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and
@[standing, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to
king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:
and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them @+.

7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and
the height of the @C chapiter was five cubits: 7:17 And nets of
checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters @ were
upon the top of the pillars; @H for the one chapiter, and @H for
the @C chapiter.

7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round @+ upon the one
network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
pomegranates: and so did he for the @C chapiter.

7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
lily work in the porch, four cubits.

7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
above, over @
 the belly @ was by the network: and the
pomegranates were two @/ in rows round @+ upon the @C
chapiter.

7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set
up the @c pillar, and @, the name @of Jachin: and he set up
the left pillar, and @, the name @of Boaz.

7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
the pillars finished.

7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
@C: it was round all @+, and his height was five cubits: and a
line of thirty cubits did compass it round @+.

7:24 And @[ the brim of it round @+ @ were knops compassing
it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round @+: the knops were
cast in two rows, when it was cast.

7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, @@ looking toward the north, and
@@ looking toward the west, and @@ looking toward the south, and
@@ looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,
and all @ hinder parts were inward.

7:26 And it was an hand @dth thick, and the brim @of was
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained
two @: baths.

7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
base, and four cubits the @dth @of, and @@ cubits the height
of it.

7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,
and the borders were between the ledges: 7:29 And on the borders that
were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the
ledges @ was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were
certain additions made of thin work.

7:30 And @ base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and
the four corners @of had @[setters: @[ the laver were
@[setters molten, at the side of @ addition.

7:31 And the @P of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
but the @P @of was round @ the work of the base, a cubit
and an half: and also upon the @P of it were gravings with @
borders, foursquare, not round.

7:32 And @[ the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit
and half a cubit.

7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
@ axletrees, and @ naves, and @ felloes, and @ spokes,
were all molten.

7:34 And @ were four @[setters to the four corners of one base:
and the @[setters were of the very base itself.

7:35 And in the top of the base was @ a round compass of half a
cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges @of and the
borders @of were of the same.

7:36 For on the plates of the ledges @of, and on the borders
@of, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, @$ to the
proportion of @ one, and additions round @+.

7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
casting, one measure, and one size.

7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
baths: and @ laver was four cubits: and upon @ one of the ten
bases one laver.

7:39 And he put five bases on the @c side of the @, and five on
the left side of the @: and he set the sea on the @c side of
the @ eastward over @
 the south.

7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for
the @ of the LORD: 7:41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two
networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters @ were upon the
top of the pillars; 7:42 And four @/ pomegranates for the two
networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 7:43 And the
ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 7:44 And one sea, and twelve
oxen @[ the sea; 7:45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the
basons: and all @ vessels, @ Hiram made to king Solomon for
the @ of the LORD, were of b@c brass.

7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarthan.

7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, @ they were
exceeding many: @" was the weight of the brass @V out.

7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the @ of
the LORD: the @\ of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the
shew@d was, 7:49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the
@c side, and five on the left, @	 the oracle, with the flowers,
and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 7:50 And the bowls, and the
snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure
gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner @,
the most holy @', and for the doors of the @, to wit, of the
temple.

7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the @ of
the LORD. And Solomon @ in the @ @ @ his @ had
dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put
@ the treasures of the @ of the LORD.

8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of @, and all the heads of
the tribes, the chief of the @s of the @ of @, unto
king Solomon in @ , that they @B @( up the ark of the
covenant of the LORD out of the city of @, @ is Zion.

8:2 And all the men of @ assembled @T unto king Solomon
at the feast in the month Ethanim, @ is the @Hth month.

8:3 And all the elders of @ came, and the @6s took up the
ark.

8:4 And they @ up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
@`, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,
even @J did the @6s and the Levites @( up.

8:5 And king Solomon, and all the @` of @, that were
assembled unto him, were with him @	 the ark, sacrificing sheep
and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

8:6 And the @6s @ in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his @', into the oracle of the @, to the most holy @',
even @[ the wings of the cherubims.

8:7 For the cherubims spread @ @ two wings over the @' of
the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves @of
above.

8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
seen out in the holy @' @	 the oracle, and they were not seen
@S: and @ they are unto this day.

8:9 There was no@7 in the ark save the two tables of stone, @
@ put @ at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
@ of @, when they came out of the land of @-.

8:10 And it came to pass, when the @6s were come out of the holy
@', that the cloud filled the @ of the LORD, 8:11 So that the
@6s could not stand to minister @ of the cloud: for the
@Y of the LORD had filled the @ of the LORD.

8:12 Then @0 Solomon, The LORD said that he @L dwell in the
thick darkness.

8:13 I have surely built thee an @ to dwell in, a settled @'

8:14 And the king turned his face @+, and blessed all the
@` of @: (and all the @` of @ stood;)
8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of @, @ @0 with

8:17 And it was in the @ of @ my @ to build an @ for

8:18 And the LORD said unto @ my @, Whereas it was in @

8:19 Nevertheless thou @ not build the @; but thy son that

8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he @0, and I am

8:21 And I have set @ a @' for the ark, wherein is the covenant

8:22 And Solomon stood @	 the @\ of the LORD in the presence of

8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of @U @&s, @ he
offered unto the LORD, two and twenty @: oxen, and an @/

dedicated the @ of the LORD.

8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
@	 the @ of the LORD: for @ he offered @_ @&s,

brasen @\ that was @	 the LORD was too little to receive the
@_ @&s, and meat @&s, and the fat of the @U
@&s.

8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all @ with him, a
@ @`, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of

fourteen days.

8:66 On the eighth day he sent the @ away: and they blessed the
king, and went unto @ tents joyful and glad of @ for all the
goodness that the LORD had done for @ his @<, and for @

9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
@ of the LORD, and the king's @, and all Solomon's desire
@ he was pleased to do, 9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the
second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.

9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have @) thy prayer and thy

@, @ thou hast built, to put my name @ for ever; and mine
eyes and mine @ @ be @ perpetually.

9:4 And if thou wilt walk @	 me, as @ thy @ walked, in

9:6 But if ye @ at all turn from following me, ye or your

9:7 Then will I cut off @ out of the land @ I have @=

@ @ @ @s out of the land of @-, and have taken

@fore hath the LORD @ upon them all this evil.

9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty @8, when Solomon had
built the two @s, the @ of the LORD, and the king's @,
9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees, and with gold, @$ to all his desire,) that
then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty @G in the land of Galilee.

9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the @G @ Solomon had

9:13 And he said, What @G are @ @ thou hast @= me, my

9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

9:15 And this is the reason of the levy @ king Solomon raised; for
to build the @ of the LORD, and his own @, and Millo, and the
wall of @ , and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

9:16 For Pharaoh king of @- had gone up, and taken Gezer, and @_
it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and
@= it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.

9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And
Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 9:19 And all the
@G of store that Solomon had, and @G for his chariots, and
@G for his horsemen, and that @ Solomon desired to build in
@ , and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

9:20 And all the @ that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, @ were not of the @ of
@, 9:21 Their @ that were left @ them in the land,
whom the @ of @ also were not able utterly to destroy,
upon @J did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

9:22 But of the @ of @ did Solomon make no bondmen: but
they were men of war, and his @<s, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
work, five @/ and fifty, @ bare rule over the @ that
wrought in the work.

9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of @ unto her
@ @ Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.

9:25 And @@ times in a year did Solomon offer @_ @&s and
@U @&s upon the @\ @ he built unto the LORD, and he
@_ incense upon the @\ that was @	 the LORD. So he finished
the @.

9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, @ is
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his @<s, shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea, with the @<s of Solomon.

9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
@/ and twenty talents, and @ it to king Solomon.

10:1 And when the queen of Sheba @) of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard
questions.

10:2 And she came to @  with a very @ train, with camels

@.

10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: @ was not any @7

10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and

10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I @) in

10:7 Howbeit I believed not the @5, until I came, and mine eyes had

10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are @ thy @<s, @ stand

10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, @ delighted in thee, to set thee

@fore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.

10:10 And she gave the king an @/ and twenty talents of gold, and

such abundance of spices as @ @ the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon.

10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that @ gold from Ophir,

10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the @ of
the LORD, and for the king's @, harps also and psalteries for
singers: @ came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.

10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that @ Solomon gave her of his royal
bounty.

So she turned and went to her own country, she and her @<s.

10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
@/ @@score and six talents of gold, 10:15 Beside that he had
of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of
all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.

10:16 And king Solomon made two @/ targets of beaten gold: six

10:17 And he made @@ @/ shields of beaten gold; @@ pound of
gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the @ of the

10:18 Moreover the king made a @ throne of ivory, and overlaid it

10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round

10:20 And twelve lions stood @ on the one side and on the @C

10:21 And all king Solomon's @bing vessels were of gold, and all
the vessels of the @ of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;
none were of silver: it was no@7 accounted of in the days of
Solomon.

10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of

10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the @ for riches

10:24 And all the @ sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, @
God had put in his @.

10:25 And they @ @ man his present, vessels of silver, and

10:26 And Solomon ga@d @? chariots and horsemen: and he had
a @: and four @/ chariots, and twelve @: horsemen,
whom he bestowed in the @G for chariots, and with the king at

10:27 And the king made silver to be in @  as stones, and
cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for

10:28 And Solomon had horses @ out of @-, and linen yarn: the

10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of @- for six @/
shekels of silver, and an horse for an @/ and fifty: and so for

11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, @? with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, and Hittites: 11:2 Of the nations concerning @ the LORD
said unto the @ of @, Ye @ not go in to them, @"

@ @ gods: Solomon clave unto @ in love.

11:3 And he had @H @/ wives, princesses, and @@ @/

11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
away his @ @ @C gods: and his @ was not perfect with
the LORD his God, as was the @ of @ his @.

11:5 For Solomon went @ Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,

11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
@ the LORD, as did @ his @.

11:7 Then did Solomon build an high @' for Chemosh, the abomination

11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, @ @_

11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, @ his @ was turned

11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done

11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for @ thy

11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one

@ I have chosen.

11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

11:15 For it came to pass, when @ was in Edom, and Joab the
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, @ he had
smitten @ male in Edom; 11:16 (For six months did Joab remain

That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his @'s @<s with

11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took

11:19 And Hadad @V @ favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he

11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's @: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's

11:21 And when Hadad @) in @- that @ slept with his @s,

11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
that, @%, thou seekest to go to @ own country? And he
@>, No@7: howbeit let me go in any wise.

11:23 And God stirred him up @F adversary, Rezon the son of
Eliadah, @ fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 11:24 And
he ga@d men unto him, and became captain over a band, when @
slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt @in, and
reigned in Damascus.

11:25 And he was an adversary to @ all the days of Solomon,
beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred @, and
reigned over Syria.

11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
Solomon's @<, whose m@C's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even
he lifted up his hand @
 the king.

11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand @

@ his @.

11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a @By man of valour: and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over

11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of

and have not walked in my ways, to do that @ is @c in mine

11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I

11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give

11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of @, but not for ever.

11:40 Solomon sought @fore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,

11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and

11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in @  over all @

11:43 And Solomon slept with his @s, and was buried in the city

12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood @

12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, @ they had @=

@ stood @	 him: 12:9 And he said unto them, What counsel give

12:11 And now whereas my @ did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will

12:12 So Jeroboam and all the @ came to Rehoboam the third day,

12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the @; for the cause

@" have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O

12:17 But as for the @ of @ @ dwelt in the @G of

12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and

12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt @in;

12:26 And Jeroboam said in his @, Now @ the kingdom return to

12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the @C put he in Dan.

12:31 And he made an @ of high @'s, and made @6s of the

12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the

he offered upon the @\. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the

13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, @, This is the sign @

13:10 So he went @F way, and returned not by the way that he came
to Bethel.

13:11 Now @ dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in
Bethel: the @5 @ he had spoken unto the king, them they told
also to @ @.

13:12 And @ @ said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
had seen what way the man of God went, @ came from @.

13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
him the ass: and he rode @on, 13:14 And went @ the man of God,
and @V him sitting @[ an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the
man of God that camest from @? And he said, I am.

13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat @d.

13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
@" will I eat @d nor @b @Z with thee in this @':
13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou @ eat no
@d nor @b @Z @, nor turn @* to go by the way that thou
camest.

13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
@0 unto me by the word of the LORD, @, Bring him back with
thee into @ @, that he may eat @d and @b @Z. But he
lied unto him.

13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat @d in his @, and
drank @Z.

13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
the LORD came unto the prophet that @ him back: 13:21 And he
cried unto the man of God that came from @, @, Thus @
 the
LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the @P of the LORD, and hast
not kept the commandment @ the LORD thy God @M thee, 13:22
But camest back, and hast eaten @d and drunk @Z in the @', of
the @ the Lord did say to thee, Eat no @d, and @b no @Z;
thy carcase @ not come unto the sepulchre of thy @s.

13:23 And it came to pass, @ he had eaten @d, and @ he had
drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom
he had @ back.

13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion
also stood by the carcase.

13:25 And, @%, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,
and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the
city where the old prophet dwelt.

13:26 And when the prophet that @ him back from the way @)
@of, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
word of the LORD: @fore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,
@ hath torn him, and slain him, @$ to the word of the LORD,
@ he @0 unto him.

13:27 And he @0 to his sons, @, Saddle me the ass. And they
saddled him.

13:28 And he went and @V his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the
carcase, nor torn the ass.

13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
it upon the ass, and @ it back: and the old prophet came to the
city, to mourn and to bury him.

13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
him, @, Alas, my @X!  13:31 And it came to pass, @ he
had buried him, that he @0 to his sons, @, When I am dead,
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my
bones beside his bones: 13:32 For the @ @ he cried by the
word of the LORD @
 the @\ in Bethel, and @
 all the
@s of the high @'s @ are in the @G of Samaria, @
surely come to pass.

13:33 After this @7 Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
made @* of the lowest of the @ @6s of the high @'s:
whosoever @L, he consecrated him, and he became one of the @6s
of the high @'s.

13:34 And this @7 became sin unto the @ of Jeroboam, even to
cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the @.

14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get
thee to Shiloh: @%, @ is Ahijah the prophet, @ told me
that I @# be king over this @.

14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
honey, and go to him: he @ tell thee what @ become of the
child.

14:4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
came to the @ of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes
were set by reason of his age.

14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, @., the wife of Jeroboam
cometh to ask a @7 of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and
thus @ thou say unto her: for it @ be, when she cometh in,
that she @ feign herself to be @F woman.

14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah @) the sound of her feet, as she
came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
feignest thou thyself to be @F? for I am sent to thee with heavy
tidings.

14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus @
 the LORD God of @, Forasmuch
as I exalted thee from @ the @, and made thee prince over my
@ @, 14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the @ of @,
and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my @< @, who
kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his @, to do
that only @ was @c in mine eyes; 14:9 But hast done evil above
all that were @	 thee: for thou hast gone and made thee @C
gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me
behind thy back: 14:10 @N, @%, I will @( evil upon the
@ of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
@
 the wall, and him that is shut up and left in @, and will
take away the remnant of the @ of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away
dung, till it be all gone.

14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city @ the dogs eat; and
him that dieth in the field @ the fowls of the air eat: for the
LORD hath spoken it.

14:12 Arise thou @fore, get thee to @ own @: and when thy
feet enter into the city, the child @ die.

14:13 And all @ @ mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
Jeroboam @ come to the grave, @ in him @ is @V some
good @7 toward the LORD God of @ in the @ of Jeroboam.

14:14 Moreover the LORD @ raise him up a king over @, who
@ cut off the @ of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.

14:15 For the LORD @ smite @, as a reed is shaken in the
@Z, and he @ root up @ out of this good land, @ he
gave to @ @s, and @ scatter them beyond the river,
@ they have made @ groves, provoking the LORD to anger.

14:16 And he @ give @ up @ of the sins of Jeroboam, who
did sin, and who made @ to sin.

14:17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 14:18 And
they buried him; and all @ mourned for him, @$ to the word
of the LORD, @ he @0 by the hand of his @< Ahijah the
prophet.

14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
reigned, @%, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of @.

14:20 And the days @ Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty @8:
and he slept with his @s, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in @. Rehoboam was
forty and one @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
@Hteen @8 in @ , the city @ the LORD did choose out
of all the tribes of @, to put his name @. And his m@C's
name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

14:22 And @ did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
him to jealousy with @ sins @ they had committed, above all
that @ @s had done.

14:23 For they also built them high @'s, and images, and groves, on
@ high hill, and @[ @ green tree.

14:24 And @ were also sodomites in the land: and they did
@$ to all the abominations of the nations @ the LORD cast
out @	 the @ of @.

14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
Shishak king of @- came up @
 @ : 14:26 And he took
away the treasures of the @ of the LORD, and the treasures of the
king's @; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields
of gold @ Solomon had made.

14:27 And king Rehoboam made in @ stead brasen shields, and
committed them unto the @D of the chief of the guard, @ kept
the door of the king's @.

14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the @ of the LORD,
that the guard bare them, and @ them back into the guard
chamber.

14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
14:30 And @ was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all @ days.

14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his @s, and was buried with his
@s in the city of @. And his m@C's name was Naamah an
Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
reigned Abijam over @.

15:2 Three @8 reigned he in @ . and his m@C's name was
Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

15:3 And he walked in all the sins of his @, @ he had done
@	 him: and his @ was not perfect with the LORD his God, as
the @ of @ his @.

15:4 Nevertheless for @'s sake did the LORD his God give him a
lamp in @ , to set up his son @ him, and to establish
@ : 15:5 Because @ did that @ was @c in the eyes of
the LORD, and turned not aside from any @7 that he @M him
all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
Hittite.

15:6 And @ was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of
his life.

15:7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @? And
@ was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

15:8 And Abijam slept with his @s; and they buried him in the
city of @: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

15:9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of @ reigned Asa
over @.

15:10 And forty and one @8 reigned he in @ . And his
m@C's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

15:11 And Asa did that @ was @c in the eyes of the LORD, as did
@ his @.

15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
the idols that his @s had made.

15:13 And also Maachah his m@C, even her he removed from being
queen, @ she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her
idol, and @_ it by the brook Kidron.

15:14 But the high @'s were not removed: nevertheless Asa's @
was perfect with the LORD all his days.

15:15 And he @ in the @ @ his @ had dedicated, and
the @ @ @9 had dedicated, into the @ of the LORD,
silver, and gold, and vessels.

15:16 And @ was war between Asa and Baasha king of @ all
@ days.

15:17 And Baasha king of @ went up @
 @, and built
Ramah, that he @B not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king
of @.

15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
treasures of the @ of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's
@, and delivered them into the hand of his @<s: and king Asa
sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of
Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, @, 15:19 There is a league between
me and thee, and between my @ and thy @: @%, I have sent
unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with
Baasha king of @, that he may depart from me.

15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
the hosts @ he had @
 the @G of @, and smote Ijon,
and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of
Naphtali.

15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha @) @of, that he left off
building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation @Eout all @; none was
exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
@of, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them
Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

15:23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his @B, and all that
he did, and the @G @ he built, are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of @? Nevertheless in the time
of his old age he was diseased in his feet.

15:24 And Asa slept with his @s, and was buried with his @s
in the city of @ his @: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in
his stead.

15:25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over @ in the
second year of Asa king of @, and reigned over @ two @8.

15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of his @, and in his sin wherewith he made @ to sin.

15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the @ of Issachar,
conspired @
 him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, @
belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all @ laid siege to
Gibbethon.

15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of @ did Baasha slay him,
and reigned in his stead.

15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
@ of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he
had destroyed him, @$ unto the @ of the LORD, @ he
@0 by his @< Ahijah the Shilonite: 15:30 Because of the sins
of Jeroboam @ he sinned, and @ he made @ sin, by his
provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of @ to anger.

15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
15:32 And @ was war between Asa and Baasha king of @ all
@ days.

15:33 In the third year of Asa king of @ began Baasha the son of
Ahijah to reign over all @ in Tirzah, twenty and four @8.

15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made @ to sin.

16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani @

Baasha, @, 16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and
made thee prince over my @ @; and thou hast walked in the
way of Jeroboam, and hast made my @ @ to sin, to provoke me
to anger with @ sins; 16:3 @., I will take away the posterity
of Baasha, and the posterity of his @; and will make thy @
like the @ of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city @ the dogs eat; and him
that dieth of his in the fields @ the fowls of the air eat.

16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
@B, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of @?  16:6 So Baasha slept with his @s, and was buried in
Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
the word of the LORD @
 Baasha, and @
 his @, even for
all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to
anger with the work of his @D, in being like the @ of Jeroboam;
and @ he killed him.

16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of @ began Elah the
son of Baasha to reign over @ in Tirzah, two @8.

16:9 And his @< Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
@
 him, as he was in Tirzah, @bing @9 drunk in the @
of Arza steward of his @ in Tirzah.

16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
and @Hth year of Asa king of @, and reigned in his stead.

16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
on his throne, that he slew all the @ of Baasha: he left him not
one that pisseth @
 a wall, @" of his kinsfolks, nor of his
friends.

16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the @ of Baasha, @$ to the
word of the LORD, @ he @0 @
 Baasha by Jehu the prophet.

16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
@ they sinned, and by @ they made @ to sin, in provoking
the LORD God of @ to anger with @ vanities.

16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
16:15 In the twenty and @Hth year of Asa king of @ did Zimri
reign @H days in Tirzah. And the @ were encamped @

Gibbethon, @ belonged to the Philistines.

16:16 And the @ that were encamped @) say, Zimri hath
conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all @ made
Omri, the captain of the host, king over @ that day in the camp.

16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all @ with him, and
they besieged Tirzah.

16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
that he went into the palace of the king's @, and @_ the king's
@ over him with fire, and died.

16:19 For his sins @ he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin @ he did,
to make @ to sin.

16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of @?  16:21 Then were the @ of @ divided into
two parts: half of the @ followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to
make him king; and half followed Omri.

16:22 But the @ that followed Omri prevailed @
 the @
that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
reigned.

16:23 In the thirty and @O year of Asa king of @ began Omri to
reign over @, twelve @8: six @8 reigned he in Tirzah.

16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver, and built on the hill, and @, the name of the city @
he built, @ the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
than all that were @	 him.

16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
in his sin wherewith he made @ to sin, to provoke the LORD God of
@ to anger with @ vanities.

16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri @ he did, and his @B
that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of @?  16:28 So Omri slept with his @s, and was
buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of @ began
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over @: and Ahab the son of Omri
reigned over @ in Samaria twenty and two @8.

16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
all that were @	 him.

16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light @7 for him to
walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and
served Baal, and worshipped him.

16:32 And he reared up an @\ for Baal in the @ of Baal, @
he had built in Samaria.

16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
of @ to anger than all the kings of @ that were @	 him.

16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
@Vation @of in Abiram his @Oborn, and set up the gates
@of in his youngest son Segub, @$ to the word of the LORD,
@ he @0 by Joshua the son of Nun.

17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of @ liveth, @	 whom I stand,
@ @ not be dew nor rain @ @8, but @$ to my word.

17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, @, 17:3 Get thee
hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,
that is @	 Jordan.

17:4 And it @ be, that thou @ @b of the brook; and I have
@M the ravens to feed thee @.

17:5 So he went and did @$ unto the word of the LORD: for he
went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is @	 Jordan.

17:6 And the ravens @ him @d and @R in the morning, and
@d and @R in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

17:7 And it came to pass @ a while, that the brook dried up,
@ @ had been no rain in the land.

17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, @, 17:9 Arise, get
thee to Zarephath, @ belongeth to Zidon, and dwell @: @%,
I have @M a widow woman @ to sustain thee.

17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
of the city, @%, the widow woman was @ gathering of sticks:
and he @, to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little @Z
in a vessel, that I may @b.

17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he @, to her, and said,
Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of @d in @ hand.

17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and,
@%, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for
me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.

17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:
but make me @of a little cake @O, and @( it unto me, and
@ make for thee and for thy son.

17:14 For thus @
 the LORD God of @, The barrel of meal @
not waste, @" @ the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the
LORD sendeth rain upon the @.

17:15 And she went and did @$ to the @ of Elijah: and she,
and he, and her @, did eat many days.

17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, @" did the cruse of oil
fail, @$ to the word of the LORD, @ he @0 by Elijah.

17:17 And it came to pass @ @ @, that the son of the
woman, the mistress of the @, fell sick; and his sickness was so
sore, that @ was no breath left in him.

17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and
to slay my son?  17:19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he
took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he
abode, and laid him upon his own bed.

17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
also @ evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her
son?  17:21 And he stretched @9 upon the child @@ times, and
cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
child's soul come into him @*.

17:22 And the LORD @) the @; of Elijah; and the soul of the
child came into him @*, and he revived.

17:23 And Elijah took the child, and @ him down out of the
chamber into the @, and delivered him unto his m@C: and Elijah
said, See, thy son liveth.

17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a
man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy @P is truth.

18:1 And it came to pass @ many days, that the word of the LORD
came to Elijah in the third year, @, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;
and I will send rain upon the @.

18:2 And Elijah went to shew @9 unto Ahab. And @ was a sore
famine in Samaria.

18:3 And Ahab @, Obadiah, @ was the governor of his @.
(Now Obadiah feared the LORD @ly: 18:4 For it was so, when Jezebel
cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an @/
prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with @d and
@Z.)  18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
fountains of @Z, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the
beasts.

18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass @Eout it: Ahab
went one way by @9, and Obadiah went @F way by @9.

18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, @%, Elijah met him: and he
knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord
Elijah?  18:8 And he @> him, I am: go, tell thy lord, @.,
Elijah is here.

18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou @Lest deliver thy
@< into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  18:10 As the LORD thy God
liveth, @ is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent
to seek thee: and when they said, He is not @; he took an oath of
the kingdom and nation, that they @V thee not.

18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, @., Elijah is here.

18:12 And it @ come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
the Spirit of the LORD @ carry thee whither I know not; and so
when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he @ slay me:
but I thy @< fear the LORD from my youth.

18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
prophets of the LORD, how I hid an @/ men of the LORD's prophets
by fifty in a cave, and fed them with @d and @Z?  18:14 And now
thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, @., Elijah is here: and he @
slay me.

18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, @	 whom I
stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
meet Elijah.

18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
him, Art thou he that troubleth @?  18:18 And he @>, I have
not troubled @; but thou, and thy @'s @, in that ye have
forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

18:19 Now @fore send, and gather to me all @ unto mount
Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four @/ and fifty, and the
prophets of the groves four @/, @ eat at Jezebel's table.

18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the @ of @, and ga@d the
prophets @? unto mount Carmel.

18:21 And Elijah came unto all the @, and said, How long halt ye
between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal,
then follow him. And the @ @> him not a word.

18:22 Then said Elijah unto the @, I, even I only, remain a
prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four @/ and fifty
men.

18:23 Let them @fore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
bullock for @T, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and
put no fire @[: and I will dress the @C bullock, and lay it on
wood, and put no fire @[: 18:24 And call ye on the name of your
gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that
answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the @ @> and
said, It is well spoken.

18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
bullock for yourselves, and dress it @O; for ye are many; and call
on the name of your gods, but put no fire @[.

18:26 And they took the bullock @ was @= them, and they dressed
it, and @, on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
@, O Baal, hear us. But @ was no @;, nor any that
@>. And they leaped upon the @\ @ was made.

18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,
or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be
awaked.

18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut @T @ @ manner with
knives and lancets, till the @I gushed out upon them.

18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
until the time of the @& of the evening sacrifice, that @
was @" @;, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

18:30 And Elijah said unto all the @, Come near unto me. And all
the @ came near unto him. And he repaired the @\ of the LORD
that was broken down.

18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, @$ to the number of the
tribes of the sons of @], unto whom the word of the LORD came,
@, @ @ be thy name: 18:32 And with the stones he built
an @\ in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench @+ the
@\, as @ as @L contain two measures of seed.

18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with @Z, and pour
it on the @_ sacrifice, and on the wood.

18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
time.

And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.

18:35 And the @Z ran round @+ the @\; and he filled the
trench also with @Z.

18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the @& of the evening
sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and of @, let it be known this day that thou art
God in @, and that I am thy @<, and that I have done all
@ @ at thy word.

18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this @ may know that thou
art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned @ @ back @*.

18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the @_
sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up
the @Z that was in the trench.

18:39 And when all the @ saw it, they fell on @ faces: and
they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah @ them down
to the brook Kishon, and slew them @.

18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and @b; for @
is a sound of abundance of rain.

18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to @b. And Elijah went up to the
top of Carmel; and he cast @9 down upon the @, and put his
face between his knees, 18:43 And said to his @<, Go up now, look
toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is
no@7. And he said, Go @* @H times.

18:44 And it came to pass at the @Hth time, that he said, @.,
@ ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he
said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down
that the rain stop thee not.

18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the @1 was black
with clouds and wind, and @ was a @ rain. And Ahab rode, and
went to Jezreel.

18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
loins, and ran @	 Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he
had slain all the prophets with the @Q.

19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, @, So let the
gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of
one of them by to morrow @+ this time.

19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
to Beersheba, @ belongeth to @, and left his @< @.

19:4 But he @9 went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came
and sat down @[ a juniper tree: and he requested for @9 that
he @B die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;
for I am not better than my @s.

19:5 And as he lay and slept @[ a juniper tree, @%, then an
angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

19:6 And he looked, and, @%, @ was a cake baken on the coals,
and a cruse of @Z at his head. And he did eat and @b, and laid
him down @*.

19:7 And the angel of the LORD came @* the second time, and touched
him, and said, Arise and eat; @ the journey is too @ for
thee.

19:8 And he arose, and did eat and @b, and went in the strength of
that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.

19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged @; and, @%,
the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest
thou here, Elijah?  19:10 And he said, I have been very jealous for
the LORD God of hosts: for the @ of @ have forsaken thy
covenant, thrown down @ @\s, and slain thy prophets with the
@Q; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
away.

19:11 And he said, Go @, and stand upon the mount @	 the LORD.

And, @%, the LORD passed by, and a @ and strong wind rent the
mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks @	 the LORD; but the LORD
was not in the wind: and @ the wind an @quake; but the LORD
was not in the @quake: 19:12 And @ the @quake a fire; but
the LORD was not in the fire: and @ the fire a still small @;.

19:13 And it was so, when Elijah @) it, that he wrapped his face in
his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.
And, @%, @ came a @; unto him, and said, What doest thou
here, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the
LORD God of hosts: @ the @ of @ have forsaken thy
covenant, thrown down @ @\s, and slain thy prophets with the
@Q; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
away.

19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king
over Syria: 19:16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi @ thou anoint to be
king over @: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah @
thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

19:17 And it @ come to pass, that him that escapeth the @Q of
Hazael @ Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the @Q of Jehu
@ Elisha slay.

19:18 Yet I have left me @H @: in @, all the knees @
have not bowed unto Baal, and @ @P @ hath not kissed him.

19:19 So he departed thence, and @V Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen @	 him, and he with the
twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.

19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran @ Elijah, and said, Let me, I
pray thee, kiss my @ and my m@C, and then I will follow thee.
And he said unto him, Go back @*: for what have I done to thee?
19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
them, and boiled @ @R with the instruments of the oxen, and
gave unto the @, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went @
Elijah, and ministered unto him.

20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria ga@d all his host @?:
and @ were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred @
 it.

20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of @ into the city, and
said unto him, Thus @
 Benhadad, 20:3 Thy silver and thy gold is
mine; thy wives also and thy @, even the goodliest, are mine.

20:4 And the king of @ @> and said, My lord, O king,
@$ to thy @, I am @, and all that I have.

20:5 And the messengers came @*, and said, Thus @Keth Benhadad,
@, Although I have sent unto thee, @, Thou @ deliver me
thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy @; 20:6 Yet I
will send my @<s unto thee to morrow @+ this time, and they
@ search @ @, and the @s of thy @<s; and it @
be, that whatsoever is pleasant in @ eyes, they @ put it in
@ hand, and take it away.

20:7 Then the king of @ @, all the elders of the land, and
said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he
sent unto me for my wives, and for my @, and for my silver, and
for my gold; and I denied him not.

20:8 And all the elders and all the @ said unto him, Hearken not
unto him, nor consent.

20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord
the king, All that thou didst send for to thy @< at the @O I
will do: but this @7 I may not do. And the messengers departed, and
@ him word @*.

20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
and more also, if the dust of Samaria @ suffice for handfuls for
all the @ that follow me.

20:11 And the king of @ @> and said, Tell him, Let not him
that girdeth on his harness boast @9 as he that putteth it off.

20:12 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad @) this message, as he
was @bing, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his
@<s, Set yourselves in array. And they set @T in array
@
 the city.

20:13 And, @%, @ came a prophet unto Ahab king of @,
@, Thus @
 the LORD, Hast thou seen all this @ multitude?
@%, I will deliver it into @ hand this day; and thou @
know that I am the LORD.

20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus @
 the LORD, Even
by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who
@ order the battle? And he @>, Thou.

20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
and they were two @/ and thirty two: and @ them he numbered
all the @, even all the @ of @, being @H @:.

20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was @bing @9
drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings
that helped him.

20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
@O; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, @, There are men
come out of Samaria.

20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for @U, take them
alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

20:19 So @ young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
the city, and the army @ followed them.

20:20 And they slew @ one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
@ pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an
horse with the horsemen.

20:21 And the king of @ went out, and smote the horses and
chariots, and slew the Syrians with a @ slaughter.

20:22 And the prophet came to the king of @, and said unto him,
Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the
return of the year the king of Syria will come up @
 thee.

20:23 And the @<s of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods
are gods of the hills; @fore they were stronger than we; but let
us fight @
 them in the plain, and surely we @ be stronger
than they.

20:24 And do this @7, Take the kings away, @ man out of his
@', and put captains in @ rooms: 20:25 And number thee an army,
like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for
chariot: and we will fight @
 them in the plain, and surely we
@ be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto @ @;, and
did so.

20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight @
 @.

20:27 And the @ of @ were numbered, and were all present,
and went @
 them: and the @ of @ pitched @	 them
like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.

20:28 And @ came a man of God, and @0 unto the king of @,
and said, Thus @
 the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD
is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, @fore will
I deliver all this @ multitude into @ hand, and ye @ know
that I am the LORD.

20:29 And they pitched one over @
 the @C @H days. And so
it was, that in the @Hth day the battle was joined: and the
@ of @ slew of the Syrians an @/ @: footmen in
one day.

20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and @ a wall fell
upon twenty and @H @: of the men that were left. And Benhadad
fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

20:31 And his @<s said unto him, @. now, we have @) that
the kings of the @ of @ are merciful kings: let us, I pray
thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out
to the king of @: peradventure he will save thy life.

20:32 So they girded sackcloth on @ loins, and put ropes on @
heads, and came to the king of @, and said, Thy @< Benhadad
@
, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is
my @X.

20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any @7 @L come
from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy @X
Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, @( him. Then Benhadad came @ to
him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.

20:34 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The @G, @ my @ took
from thy @, I will restore; and thou @ make streets for thee
in Damascus, as my @ made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send
thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent
him away.

20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man
refused to smite him.

20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the @; of
the LORD, @%, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion @
slay thee.

And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion @V him, and slew
him.

20:37 Then he @V @F man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And
the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
disguised @9 with ashes upon his face.

20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,
Thy @< went out into the @a of the battle; and, @%, a man
turned aside, and @ a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if
by any means he be missing, then @ thy life be for his life, or
else thou @ pay a talent of silver.

20:40 And as thy @< was busy here and @, he was gone. And the
king of @ said unto him, So @ thy judgment be; thyself hast
decided it.

20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
king of @ discerned him that he was of the prophets.

20:42 And he said unto him, Thus @
 the LORD, Because thou hast let
go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,
@fore thy life @ go for his life, and thy @ for his
@.

20:43 And the king of @ went to his @ heavy and displeased,
and came to Samaria.

21:1 And it came to pass @ @ @, that Naboth the
Jezreelite had a vineyard, @ was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of
Ahab king of Samaria.

21:2 And Ahab @0 unto Naboth, @, Give me thy vineyard, that I
may have it for a garden of herbs, @ it is near unto my @:
and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem
good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.

21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I @#
give the inheritance of my @s unto thee.

21:4 And Ahab came into his @ heavy and displeased @ of the
word @ Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I
will not give thee the inheritance of my @s. And he laid him down
upon his bed, and turned away his face, and @L eat no @d.

21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
spirit so sad, that thou eatest no @d?  21:6 And he said unto her,
Because I @0 unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me
thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee
@F vineyard for it: and he @>, I will not give thee my

21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
kingdom of @? arise, and eat @d, and let @ @ be merry:
I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were
in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

21:9 And she wrote in the letters, @, Proclaim a fast, and set
Naboth on high @ the @: 21:10 And set two men, sons of
Belial, @	 him, to bear witness @
 him, @, Thou didst
blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him,
that he may die.

21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were
the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as
it was written in the letters @ she had sent unto them.

21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high @ the @.

21:13 And @ came in two men, @ of Belial, and sat @

 him, even @
 Naboth,
in the presence of the @, @, Naboth did blaspheme God and
the king. Then they carried him @ out of the city, and stoned him
with stones, that he died.

21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, @, Naboth is stoned, and is
dead.

21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel @) that Naboth was stoned,
and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, @ he refused to give thee for
money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.

21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab @) that Naboth was dead, that
Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to
take possession of it.

21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, @,
21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of @, @ is in Samaria:
@%, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to

21:19 And thou @ @K unto him, @, Thus @

21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou @V me, O mine enemy? And

21:21 @., I will @( evil upon thee, and will take away thy

@ @ like the @ of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the

21:23 And of Jezebel also @0 the LORD, @, The dogs @ eat
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs @ eat; and him

21:25 But @ was none like unto Ahab, @ did sell @9 to

21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, @$ to all

21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab @) @J @5, that he rent

21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, @,
21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth @9 @	 me? @ he

in his son's days will I @( the evil upon his @.

22:1 And they continued @@ @8 @S war between Syria and
@.

22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
of @ came down to the king of @.

22:3 And the king of @ said unto his @<s, Know ye that
Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the
hand of the king of Syria?  22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt
thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the
king of @, I am as thou art, my @ as thy @, my horses
as thy horses.

22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of @, Enquire, I pray
thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

22:6 Then the king of @ ga@d the prophets @?, @+
four @/ men, and said unto them, Shall I go @
 Ramothgilead
to battle, or @ I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD
@ deliver it into the hand of the king.

22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is @ not here a prophet of the LORD
besides, that we @B enquire of him?  22:8 And the king of @
said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,
by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not
prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not
the king say so.

22:9 Then the king of @ @, an officer, and said, Hasten
hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

22:10 And the king of @ and Jehoshaphat the king of @ sat
each on his throne, having put on @ robes, in a void @' in the
entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied
@	 them.

22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
said, Thus @
 the LORD, With @ @ thou push the Syrians,
until thou have consumed them.

22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, @, Go up to
Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD @ deliver it into the
king's hand.

22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah @0 unto him,
@, @. now, the @5 of the prophets declare good unto the
king with one @P: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of
one of them, and @K that @ is good.

22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD @
 unto
me, that will I @K.

22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
@ we go @
 Ramothgilead to battle, or @ we forbear? And
he @> him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD @ deliver it into
the hand of the king.

22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times @ I adjure thee
that thou tell me no@7 but that @ is true in the name of the
LORD?  22:17 And he said, I saw all @ scattered upon the hills,
as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no
master: let them return @ man to his @ in @U.

22:18 And the king of @ said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
thee that he @L prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  22:19
And he said, Hear thou @fore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD
sitting on his throne, and all the host of @1 standing by him on
his @c hand and on his left.

22:20 And the LORD said, Who @ persuade Ahab, that he may go up
and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and @F
said on that manner.

22:21 And @ came @ a spirit, and stood @	 the LORD, and
said, I will persuade him.

22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
@, and I will be a lying spirit in the @P of all his prophets.
And he said, Thou @ persude him, and prevail also: go @, and
do so.

22:23 Now @fore, @%, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
@P of all @ thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
concerning thee.

22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me
to @K unto thee?  22:25 And Micaiah said, @., thou @ see in
that day, when thou @ go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

22:26 And the king of @ said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 22:27
And say, Thus @
 the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed
him with @d of affliction and with @Z of affliction, until I
come in @U.

22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in @U, the LORD hath
not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O @, @ one of you.

22:29 So the king of @ and Jehoshaphat the king of @ went up
to Ramothgilead.

22:30 And the king of @ said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the
king of @ disguised @9, and went into the battle.

22:31 But the king of Syria @M his thirty and two captains that
had rule over his chariots, @, Fight @" with small nor
@, save only with the king of @.

22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of @. And they
turned aside to fight @
 him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.

22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
that it was not the king of @, that they turned back from
pursuing him.

22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
@ between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the
driver of his chariot, Turn @ hand, and carry me out of the host;
for I am wounded.

22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in
his chariot @
 the Syrians, and died at even: and the @I ran
out of the wound into the @a of the chariot.

22:36 And @ went a proclamation @Eout the host @+ the
going down of the sun, @, Every man to his city, and @ man to
his own country.

22:37 So the king died, and was @ to Samaria; and they buried
the king in Samaria.

22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
licked up his @I; and they washed his armour; @$ unto the
word of the LORD @ he @0.

22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
ivory @ @ he made, and all the @G that he built, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
22:40 So Ahab slept with his @s; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
his stead.

22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over @ in the
fourth year of Ahab king of @.

22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five @8 old when he began to
reign; and he reigned twenty and five @8 in @ . And his
m@C's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his @; he turned not
aside from it, doing that @ was @c in the eyes of the LORD:
nevertheless the high @'s were not taken away; for the @
offered and @_ incense yet in the high @'s.

22:44 And Jehoshaphat made @U with the king of @.

22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his @B that he
shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of @?  22:46 And the remnant of the
sodomites, @ remained in the days of his @ Asa, he took out
of the land.

22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
@<s go with thy @<s in the ships. But Jehoshaphat @L not.

22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his @s, and was buried with his
@s in the city of @ his @: and Jehoram his son reigned
in his stead.

22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over @ in Samaria
the @Hteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of @, and reigned two
@8 over @.

22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of his @, and in the way of his m@C, and in the way of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made @ to sin: 22:53 For he served
Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
@, @$ to all that his @ had done.




The Second Book of the Kings

Commonly Called:

The Fourth Book of the Kings


1:1 Then Moab rebelled @
 @ @ the @^ of Ahab.

1:2 And Ahaziah fell down @E a lattice in his upper chamber that
was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto
them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I @
recover of this disease.

1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go
up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,
Is it not @ @ is not a God in @, that ye go to enquire
of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?  1:4 Now @fore thus @
 the LORD,
Thou @ not come down from that bed on @ thou art gone up, but
@ surely die. And Elijah departed.

1:5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,
Why are ye now turned back?  1:6 And they said unto him, There came a
man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn @* unto the king that
sent you, and say unto him, Thus @
 the LORD, Is it not @
@ is not a God in @, that thou sendest to enquire of
Baalzebub the god of Ekron? @fore thou @ not come down from
that bed on @ thou art gone up, but @ surely die.

1:7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he @ came up to
meet you, and told you @ @5?  1:8 And they @> him, He was
an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather @+ his loins. And
he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.

1:9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And
he went up to him: and, @%, he sat on the top of an hill. And he
@0 unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.

1:10 And Elijah @> and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a
man of God, then let fire come down from @1, and consume thee and
thy fifty.

And @ came down fire from @1, and consumed him and his fifty.

1:11 Again also he sent unto him @F captain of fifty with his
fifty.

And he @> and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king
said, Come down quickly.

1:12 And Elijah @> and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
fire come down from @1, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the
fire of God came down from @1, and consumed him and his fifty.

1:13 And he sent @* a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees
@	 Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I
pray thee, let my life, and the life of @ fifty thy @<s, be
precious in thy sight.

1:14 @., @ came fire down from @1, and @_ up the two
captains of the former fifties with @ fifties: @fore let my
life now be precious in thy sight.

1:15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be
not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.

1:16 And he said unto him, Thus @
 the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast
sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not
@ @ is no God in @ to enquire of his word? @fore
thou @ not come down off that bed on @ thou art gone up, but
@ surely die.

1:17 So he died @$ to the word of the LORD @ Elijah had
spoken.

And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son
of Jehoshaphat king of @; @ he had no son.

1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah @ he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  2:1 And
it came to pass, when the LORD @L take up Elijah into @1 by a
whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.

2:2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth,
and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to
Bethel.

2:3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came @ to
Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away
thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye
your @U.

2:4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as
thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.

2:5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,
and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy
master from thy head to day? And he @>, Yea, I know it; hold ye
your @U.

2:6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD
hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.

2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view
afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

2:8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it @?, and smote the
@Zs, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two
went over on dry ground.

2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said
unto Elisha, Ask what I @ do for thee, @	 I be taken away from
thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit
be upon me.

2:10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard @7: nevertheless, if thou
see me when I am taken from thee, it @ be so unto thee; but if
not, it @ not be so.

2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
@%, @ appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and
parted them both as@[; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
@1.

2:12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My @, my @, the
chariot of @, and the horsemen @of. And he saw him no more:
and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

2:13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 2:14 And he took the mantle of
Elijah that fell from him, and smote the @Zs, and said, Where is
the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the @Zs, they
parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.

2:15 And when the sons of the prophets @ were to view at Jericho
saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they
came to meet him, and bowed @T to the ground @	 him.

2:16 And they said unto him, @. now, @ be with thy @<s
fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest
peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him
upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye @ not
send.

2:17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They
sent @fore fifty men; and they sought @@ days, but @V him
not.

2:18 And when they came @* to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?  2:19 And the men of
the city said unto Elisha, @., I pray thee, the situation of this
city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the @Z is naught, and the
ground barren.

2:20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt @in. And they
@ it to him.

2:21 And he went @ unto the spring of the @Zs, and cast the
salt in @, and said, Thus @
 the LORD, I have healed @
@Zs; @ @ not be from thence any more @^ or barren land.

2:22 So the @Zs were healed unto this day, @$ to the @
of Elisha @ he @0.

2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
the way, @ came @ little @ out of the city, and mocked
him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.

2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
name of the LORD. And @ came @ two she bears out of the wood,
and tare forty and two @ of them.

2:25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
returned to Samaria.

3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over @ in Samaria
the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of @, and reigned twelve
@8.

3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
@, and like his m@C: for he put away the image of Baal that
his @ had made.

3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, @ made @ to sin; he departed not @from.

3:4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
king of @ an @/ @: lambs, and an @/ @:
rams, with the wool.

3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
rebelled @
 the king of @.

3:6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
all @.

3:7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of @, @, The
king of Moab hath rebelled @
 me: wilt thou go with me @

Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my @
as thy @, and my horses as thy horses.

3:8 And he said, Which way @ we go up? And he @>, The way
@E the wilderness of Edom.

3:9 So the king of @ went, and the king of @, and the king of
Edom: and they fetched a compass of @H days' journey: and @ was
no @Z for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.

3:10 And the king of @ said, Alas! that the LORD hath @,
@ @@ kings @?, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is @ not here a prophet of the LORD,
that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
@'s @<s @> and said, Here is Elisha the son of
Shaphat, @ poured @Z on the @D of Elijah.

3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
king of @ and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.

3:13 And Elisha said unto the king of @, What have I to do with
thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy @, and to the prophets of
thy m@C.

And the king of @ said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath @,
@ @@ kings @?, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.

3:14 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, @	 whom I
stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat
the king of @, I @L not look toward thee, nor see thee.

3:15 But now @( me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

3:16 And he said, Thus @
 the LORD, Make this valley full of
ditches.

3:17 For thus @
 the LORD, Ye @ not see wind, @" @ ye
see rain; yet that valley @ be filled with @Z, that ye may
@b, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

3:18 And this is but a light @7 in the sight of the LORD: he will
deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

3:19 And ye @ smite @ fenced city, and @ choice city, and
@ fell @ good tree, and stop all wells of @Z, and mar @
good piece of land with stones.

3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat @& was
offered, that, @%, @ came @Z by the way of Edom, and the
country was filled with @Z.

3:21 And when all the Moabites @) that the kings were come up to
fight @
 them, they ga@d all that were able to put on armour,
and upward, and stood in the border.

3:22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
@Z, and the Moabites saw the @Z on the @C side as red as
@I: 3:23 And they said, This is @I: the kings are surely slain,
and they have smitten one @F: now @fore, Moab, to the spoil.

3:24 And when they came to the camp of @, the @ites rose up
and smote the Moabites, so that they fled @	 them: but they went
forward smiting the Moabites, even in @ country.

3:25 And they beat down the @G, and on @ good piece of land
cast @ man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the
wells of @Z, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth
left they the stones @of; howbeit the slingers went @+ it, and
smote it.

3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
him, he took with him @H @/ men that drew @Qs, to break
@E even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

3:27 Then he took his eldest son that @# have reigned in his
stead, and offered him for a @_ @& upon the wall. And @
was @ indignation @
 @: and they departed from him, and
returned to @ own land.

4:1 Now @ cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto Elisha, @, Thy @< my husband is dead; and thou
knowest that thy @< did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come
to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.

4:2 And Elisha said unto her, What @ I do for thee? tell me, what
hast thou in the @? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any
@7 in the @, save a pot of oil.

4:3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

4:4 And when thou art come in, thou @ shut the door upon thee and
upon thy sons, and @ pour out into all @J vessels, and thou
@ set aside that @ is full.

4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
sons, who @ the vessels to her; and she poured out.

4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is
not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy @ of the rest.

4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a
@ woman; and she constrained him to eat @d. And so it was, that
as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat @d.

4:9 And she said unto her husband, @. now, I perceive that this is
an holy man of God, @ passeth by us continually.

4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let
us set for him @ a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a
candlestick: and it @ be, when he cometh to us, that he @ turn
in thither.

4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
the chamber, and lay @.

4:12 And he said to Gehazi his @<, Call this Shunammite. And when
he had @, her, she stood @	 him.

4:13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, @., thou hast been
careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?
@Lest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the
host? And she @>, I dwell @ mine own @.

4:14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
@>, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

4:15 And he said, Call her. And when he had @, her, she stood in
the door.

4:16 And he said, About this season, @$ to the time of life,
thou @ embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God,
do not lie unto @ handmaid.

4:17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
Elisha had said unto her, @$ to the time of life.

4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out
to his @ to the reapers.

4:19 And he said unto his @, My head, my head. And he said to a
lad, Carry him to his m@C.

4:20 And when he had taken him, and @ him to his m@C, he sat
on her knees till noon, and then died.

4:21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and
shut the door upon him, and went out.

4:22 And she @, unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,
one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man
of God, and come @*.

4:23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is @"
new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It @ be well.

4:24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her @<, Drive, and go
forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

4:25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it
came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to
Gehazi his @<, @., yonder is that Shunammite: 4:26 Run now, I
pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it
well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she @>, It
is well: 4:27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she
caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her:
and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.

4:28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do
not deceive me?  4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and
take my staff in @ hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man,
salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not @*: and lay
my staff upon the face of the child.

4:30 And the m@C of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.

4:31 And Gehazi passed on @	 them, and laid the staff upon the
face of the child; but @ was @" @;, nor hearing. Wherefore
he went @* to meet him, and told him, @, The child is not
awaked.

4:32 And when Elisha was come into the @, @%, the child was
dead, and laid upon his bed.

4:33 He went in @fore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
prayed unto the LORD.

4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his @P upon
his @P, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his @D upon his @D:
and stretched @9 upon the child; and the @R of the child waxed
warm.

4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the @ to and fro; and went
up, and stretched @9 upon him: and the child sneezed @H times,
and the child opened his eyes.

4:36 And he @, Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
@, her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy
son.

4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground, and took up her son, and went out.

4:38 And Elisha came @* to Gilgal: and @ was a d@ in the
land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting @	 him: and he
said unto his @<, Set on the @ pot, and seethe pottage for
the sons of the prophets.

4:39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and @V a wild
vine, and ga@d @of wild gourds his lap full, and came and
shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.

4:40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou
man of God, @ is @^ in the pot. And they could not eat @of.

4:41 But he said, Then @( meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
said, Pour out for the @, that they may eat. And @ was no
harm in the pot.

4:42 And @ came a man from Baalshalisha, and @ the man of
God @d of the @Ofruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears
of corn in the husk @of. And he said, Give unto the @, that
they may eat.

4:43 And his servitor said, What, @# I set this @	 an @/
men?  He said @*, Give the @, that they may eat: for thus
@
 the LORD, They @ eat, and @ leave @of.

4:44 So he set it @	 them, and they did eat, and left @of,
@$ to the word of the LORD.

5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a @
man with his master, and honourable, @ by him the LORD had @=
deliverance unto Syria: he was also a @By man in valour, but he was
a leper.

5:2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had @ away
captive out of the land of @ a little maid; and she waited on
Naaman's wife.

5:3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
prophet that is in Samaria! for he @L recover him of his leprosy.

5:4 And one went in, and told his lord, @, Thus and thus said the
maid that is of the land of @.

5:5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
unto the king of @. And he departed, and took with him ten
talents of silver, and six @: pieces of gold, and ten changes of
raiment.

5:6 And he @ the letter to the king of @, @, Now when
this letter is come unto thee, @%, I have @with sent Naaman my
@< to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of @ had read the letter,
that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make
alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his
leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a
quarrel @
 me.

5:8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had @) that the king
of @ had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, @,
Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he
@ know that @ is a prophet in @.

5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at
the door of the @ of Elisha.

5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, @, Go and wash in
Jordan @H times, and thy @R @ come @* to thee, and thou
@ be clean.

5:11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, @., I thought,
He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the
LORD his God, and strike his hand over the @', and recover the
leper.

5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
the @Zs of @? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he
turned and went away in a rage.

5:13 And his @<s came near, and @0 unto him, and said, My
@, if the prophet had bid thee do some @ @7, @Lest thou
not have done it? how much rather then, when he @
 to thee, Wash,
and be clean?  5:14 Then went he down, and dipped @9 @H times
in Jordan, @$ to the @ of the man of God: and his @R
came @* like unto the @R of a little child, and he was clean.

5:15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
came, and stood @	 him: and he said, @., now I know that @
is no God in all the @, but in @: now @fore, I pray thee,
take a blessing of thy @<.

5:16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, @	 whom I stand, I will
receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

5:17 And Naaman said, Shall @ not then, I pray thee, be @= to
thy @< two mules' burden of @? for thy @< will
hence@ offer @" @_ @& nor sacrifice unto @C gods,
but unto the LORD.

5:18 In this @7 the LORD pardon thy @<, that when my master
goeth into the @ of Rimmon to worship @, and he leaneth on my
hand, and I bow myself in the @ of Rimmon: when I bow down myself
in the @ of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy @< in this @7.

5:19 And he said unto him, Go in @U. So he departed from him a
little way.

5:20 But Gehazi, the @< of Elisha the man of God, said, @.,
my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his
@D that @ he @: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run @
him, and take somewhat of him.

5:21 So Gehazi followed @ Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
@ him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is
all well?  5:22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me,
@, @., even now @ be come to me from mount Ephraim two
young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a
talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

5:23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,
and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of
garments, and laid them upon two of his @<s; and they bare them
@	 him.

5:24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from @ hand, and
bestowed them in the @: and he let the men go, and they departed.

5:25 But he went in, and stood @	 his master. And Elisha said unto
him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy @< went no
whither.

5:26 And he said unto him, Went not mine @ with thee, when the man
turned @* from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and
sheep, and oxen, and men@<s, and maid@<s?  5:27 The leprosy
@fore of Naaman @ cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for
ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

6:1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, @. now, the
@' where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence @ man a
beam, and let us make us a @' @, where we may dwell. And he
@>, Go ye.

6:3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy @<s.
And he @>, I will go.

6:4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
wood.

6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the @Z:
and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.

6:6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
@'.

And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did
swim.

6:7 @N said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,
and took it.

6:8 Then the king of Syria warred @
 @, and took counsel
with his @<s, @, In such and such a @' @ be my camp.

6:9 And the man of God sent unto the king of @, @, Beware
that thou pass not such a @'; for thither the Syrians are come
down.

6:10 And the king of @ sent to the @' @ the man of God
told him and warned him of, and saved @9 @, not once nor
twice.

6:11 @N the @ of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
this @7; and he @, his @<s, and said unto them, Will ye
not shew me @ of us is for the king of @?  6:12 And one of
his @<s said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that
is in @, telleth the king of @ the @5 that thou @Kest
in thy bedchamber.

6:13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
him.

And it was told him, @, @., he is in Dothan.

6:14 @N sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a @ host:
and they came by night, and compassed the city @+.

6:15 And when the @< of the man of God was risen early, and gone
@, @%, an host compassed the city both with horses and
chariots. And his @< said unto him, Alas, my master! how @ we
do?  6:16 And he @>, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
than they that be with them.

6:17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he
saw: and, @%, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire
round @+ Elisha.

6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
said, Smite this @, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote
them with blindness @$ to the word of Elisha.

6:19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, @" is this
the city: follow me, and I will @( you to the man whom ye seek. But
he led them to Samaria.

6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of @ men, that they may see. And
the LORD opened @ eyes, and they saw; and, @%, they were in
the @a of Samaria.

6:21 And the king of @ said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
@, @ I smite them? @ I smite them?  6:22 And he @>,
Thou @ not smite them: @Lest thou smite @J whom thou hast
taken captive with thy @Q and with thy bow? set @d and @Z
@	 them, that they may eat and @b, and go to @ master.

6:23 And he prepared @ provision for them: and when they had eaten
and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to @ master. So the
bands of Syria came no more into the land of @.

6:24 And it came to pass @ this, that Benhadad king of Syria
ga@d all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

6:25 And @ was a @ famine in Samaria: and, @%, they
besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of
silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of
silver.

6:26 And as the king of @ was passing by upon the wall, @
cried a woman unto him, @, Help, my lord, O king.

6:27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence @ I help
thee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  6:28 And the
king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she @>, This woman
said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will
eat my son to morrow.

6:29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.

6:30 And it came to pass, when the king @) the @5 of the woman,
that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the
@ looked, and, @%, he had sackcloth within upon his @R.

6:31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
Elisha the son of Shaphat @ stand on him this day.

6:32 But Elisha sat in his @, and the elders sat with him; and the
king sent a man from @	 him: but ere the messenger came to him, he
said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to
take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door,
and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet
behind him?  6:33 And while he yet talked with them, @%, the
messenger came down unto him: and he said, @., this evil is of the
LORD; what @# I wait for the LORD any longer?  7:1 Then Elisha
said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus @
 the LORD, To morrow
@+ this time @ a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel,
and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

7:2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned @> the man of God,
and said, @., if the LORD @L make windows in @1, @B this
@7 be?  And he said, @., thou @ see it with @ eyes, but
@ not eat @of.

7:3 And @ were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:
and they said one to @F, Why sit we here until we die?  7:4 If we
say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and
we @ die @: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now
@fore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they
save us alive, we @ live; and if they kill us, we @ but die.

7:5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of
Syria, @%, @ was no man @.

7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a @ host: and
they said one to @F, Lo, the king of @ hath hired @
 us
the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the @-ians, to come
upon us.

7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left @
tents, and @ horses, and @ asses, even the camp as it was, and
fled for @ life.

7:8 And when @ lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
went into one tent, and did eat and @b, and carried thence silver,
and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came @*, and
entered into @F tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid
it.

7:9 Then they said one to @F, We do not well: this day is a day
of good tidings, and we hold our @U: if we tarry till the morning
light, some mischief will come upon us: now @fore come, that we
may go and tell the king's @hold.

7:10 So they came and @, unto the porter of the city: and they
told them, @, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, @%,
@ was no man @, @" @; of man, but horses tied, and
asses tied, and the tents as they were.

7:11 And he @, the porters; and they told it to the king's @
within.

7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his @<s, I
will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we
be hungry; @fore are they gone out of the camp to hide @T
in the field, @, When they come out of the city, we @ catch
them alive, and get into the city.

7:13 And one of his @<s @> and said, Let some take, I pray
thee, five of the horses that remain, @ are left in the city,
(@%, they are as all the multitude of @ that are left in it:
@%, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the @ites
that are consumed:) and let us send and see.

7:14 They took @fore two chariot horses; and the king sent @
the host of the Syrians, @, Go and see.

7:15 And they went @ them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
full of garments and vessels, @ the Syrians had cast away in @
haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.

7:16 And the @ went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So
a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of
barley for a shekel, @$ to the word of the LORD.

7:17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
the charge of the gate: and the @ trode upon him in the gate, and
he died, as the man of God had said, who @0 when the king came down
to him.

7:18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
@, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine
flour for a shekel, @ be to morrow @+ this time in the gate of
Samaria: 7:19 And that lord @> the man of God, and said, Now,
@%, if the LORD @# make windows in @1, @B such a @7
be? And he said, @., thou @ see it with @ eyes, but @
not eat @of.

7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the @ trode upon him in the
gate, and he died.

8:1 Then @0 Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
life, @, Arise, and go thou and @ @hold, and sojourn
wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath @, for a famine;
and it @ also come upon the land @H @8.

8:2 And the woman arose, and did @ the @ of the man of God:
and she went with her @hold, and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines @H @8.

8:3 And it came to pass at the @H @8' end, that the woman
returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went @ to cry
unto the king for her @ and for her land.

8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the @< of the man of God,
@, Tell me, I pray thee, all the @ @ that Elisha hath
done.

8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
restored a dead body to life, that, @%, the woman, whose son he
had restored to life, cried to the king for her @ and for her
land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is
her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
appointed unto her a certain officer, @, Restore all that was
hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the
land, even until now.

8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was
sick; and it was told him, @, The man of God is come hither.

8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in @ hand, and
go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, @, Shall
I recover of this disease?  8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a
present with him, even of @ good @7 of Damascus, forty camels'
burden, and came and stood @	 him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king
of Syria hath sent me to thee, @, Shall I recover of this
disease?  8:10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he @
surely die.

8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:
and the man of God wept.

8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he @>, Because I
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the @ of @: @
strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and @ young men wilt thou slay
with the @Q, and wilt dash @ @, and rip up @ women
with child.

8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy @< a dog, that he @#
do this @ @7? And Elisha @>, The LORD hath shewed me that
thou @ be king over Syria.

8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
him, What said Elisha to thee? And he @>, He told me that thou
@#est surely recover.

8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
and dipped it in @Z, and spread it on his face, so that he died:
and Hazael reigned in his stead.

8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of @,
Jehoshaphat being then king of @, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat
king of @ began to reign.

8:17 Thirty and two @8 old was he when he began to reign; and he
reigned eight @8 in @ .

8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of @, as did the @
of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the
sight of the LORD.

8:19 Yet the LORD @L not destroy @ for @ his @<'s
sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
@.

8:20 In his days Edom revolted from @[ the hand of @, and made
a king over @T.

8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
rose by night, and smote the Edomites @ compassed him @+, and
the captains of the chariots: and the @ fled into @ tents.

8:22 Yet Edom revolted from @[ the hand of @ unto this day.
Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  8:24
And Joram slept with his @s, and was buried with his @s in
the city of @: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of @ did
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of @ begin to reign.

8:26 Two and twenty @8 old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and
he reigned one year in @ . And his m@C's name was Athaliah,
the daughter of Omri king of @.

8:27 And he walked in the way of the @ of Ahab, and did evil in
the sight of the LORD, as did the @ of Ahab: for he was the son in
law of the @ of Ahab.

8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war @
 Hazael
king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
@ the Syrians had @= him at Ramah, when he fought @

Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of @
went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, @ he was
sick.

9:1 And Elisha the prophet @, one of the @ of the prophets,
and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in
@ hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 9:2 And when thou comest thither,
look out @ Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go
in, and make him arise up from @ his @3, and carry him to an
inner chamber; 9:3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head,
and say, Thus @
 the LORD, I have anointed thee king over @.
Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
Ramothgilead.

9:5 And when he came, @%, the captains of the host were sitting;
and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto
@ of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.

9:6 And he arose, and went into the @; and he poured the oil on

 the LORD God of @, I have
anointed thee king over the @ of the LORD, even over @.

9:7 And thou @ smite the @ of Ahab thy master, that I may
avenge the @I of my @<s the prophets, and the @I of all the
@<s of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

9:8 For the whole @ of Ahab @ perish: and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth @
 the wall, and him that is shut up and
left in @: 9:9 And I will make the @ of Ahab like the @
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the @ of Baasha the son of
Ahijah: 9:10 And the dogs @ eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,
and @ @ be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.

9:11 Then Jehu came @ to the @<s of his lord: and one said
unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he
said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
thus @0 he to me, @, Thus @
 the LORD, I have anointed thee
king over @.

9:13 Then they hasted, and took @ man his garment, and put it
@[ him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, @,
Jehu is king.

9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
@
 Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all @,
@ of Hazael king of Syria.

9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
@ the Syrians had @= him, when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go @
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.

9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
@.

And Ahaziah king of @ was come down to see Joram.

9:17 And @ stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram
said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it
@U?  9:18 So @ went one on horseback to meet him, and said,
Thus @
 the king, Is it @U? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do
with @U? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, @, The
messenger came to them, but he cometh not @*.

9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, @ came to them, and
said, Thus @
 the king, Is it @U? And Jehu @>, What hast
thou to do with @U? turn thee behind me.

9:20 And the watchman told, @, He came even unto them, and cometh
not @*: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
Joram king of @ and Ahaziah king of @ went out, each in his
chariot, and they went out @
 Jehu, and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite.

9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
@U, Jehu? And he @>, What @U, so long as the whoredoms of
thy m@C Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?  9:23 And Joram
turned his @D, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O
Ahaziah.

9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
between his arms, and the arrow went out at his @, and he sunk
down in his chariot.

9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how
that, when I and thou rode @? @ Ahab his @, the LORD
laid this burden upon him; 9:26 Surely I have seen yesterday the @I
of Naboth, and the @I of his sons, @
 the LORD; and I will
requite thee in this plat, @
 the LORD. Now @fore take and cast
him into the plat of ground, @$ to the word of the LORD.

9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of @ saw this, he fled by the way
of the garden @. And Jehu followed @ him, and said, Smite him
also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, @ is
by Ibleam.

And he fled to Megiddo, and died @.

9:28 And his @<s carried him in a chariot to @ , and
buried him in his sepulchre with his @s in the city of @.

9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
to reign over @.

9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel @) of it; and she
painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.

9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri @U,
who slew his master?  9:32 And he lifted up his face to the window,
and said, Who is on my side?  who? And @ looked out to him two or
@@ eunuchs.

9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
her @I was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode
her @[ foot.

9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and @b, and said, Go, see
now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.

9:35 And they went to bury her: but they @V no more of her than the
skull, and the feet, and the palms of her @D.

9:36 Wherefore they came @*, and told him. And he said, This is the
word of the LORD, @ he @0 by his @< Elijah the Tishbite,
@, In the portion of Jezreel @ dogs eat the @R of Jezebel:
9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel @ be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they @ not say, This is
Jezebel.

10:1 And Ahab had @Hty sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to
them that @ up Ahab's @, @, 10:2 Now as soon as this
letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and
@ are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and
armour; 10:3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons,
and set him on his @'s throne, and fight for your master's @.

10:4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, @., two kings
stood not @	 him: how then @ we stand?  10:5 And he that was
over the @, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and
the @(ers up of the @, sent to Jehu, @, We are thy
@<s, and will do all that thou @ bid us; we will not make any
king: do thou that @ is good in @ eyes.

10:6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, @, If ye be
mine, and if ye will hearken unto my @;, take ye the heads of the
men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this
time. Now the king's sons, being @Hty persons, were with the @
men of the city, @ @ them up.

10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took
the king's sons, and slew @Hty persons, and put @ heads in
baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

10:8 And @ came a messenger, and told him, @, They have
@ the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two
heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
and said to all the @, Ye be @ceous: @%, I conspired
@
 my master, and slew him: but who slew all @?  10:10 Know
now that @ @ fall unto the @ no@7 of the word of the
LORD, @ the LORD @0 concerning the @ of Ahab: for the LORD
hath done that @ he @0 by his @< Elijah.

10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the @ of Ahab in Jezreel,
and all his @ men, and his kinsfolks, and his @6s, until he
left him none remaining.

10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at
the shearing @ in the way, 10:13 Jehu met with the @3 of
Ahaziah king of @, and said, Who are ye? And they @>, We are
the @3 of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the @ of the
king and the @ of the queen.

10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
them at the pit of the shearing @, even two and forty men; @"
left he any of them.

10:15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son
of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is
@ @ @c, as my @ is with thy @? And Jehonadab
@>, It is. If it be, give me @ hand. And he gave him his
hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

10:16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they
made him ride in his chariot.

10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab
in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, @$ to the @ of the
LORD, @ he @0 to Elijah.

10:18 And Jehu ga@d all the @ @?, and said unto them,
Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu @ serve him much.

10:19 Now @fore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
@<s, and all his @6s; let none be wanting: for I have a @
sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever @ be wanting, he @ not
live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he @B destroy
the worshippers of Baal.

10:20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
proclaimed it.

10:21 And Jehu sent @E all @: and all the worshippers of
Baal came, so that @ was not a man left that came not. And they
came into the @ of Baal; and the @ of Baal was full from one
end to @F.

10:22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring @
vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he @ them @
vestments.

10:23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the @
of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that
@ be here with you none of the @<s of the LORD, but the
worshippers of Baal only.

10:24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and @_ @&s,
Jehu appointed fourscore men @S, and said, If any of the men whom
I have @ into your @D escape, he that letteth him go, his
life @ be for the life of him.

10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of @&
the @_ @&, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,
Go in, and slay them; let none come @. And they smote them with
the edge of the @Q; and the guard and the captains cast them out,
and went to the city of the @ of Baal.

10:26 And they @ @ the images out of the @ of Baal, and
burned them.

10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the @
of Baal, and made it a draught @ unto this day.

10:28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of @.

10:29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
@ to sin, Jehu departed not from @ them, to wit, the golden
calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

10:30 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
executing that @ is @c in mine eyes, and hast done unto the
@ of Ahab @$ to all that was in mine @, thy @ of
the fourth generation @ sit on the throne of @.

10:31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
@ with all his @: for he departed not from the sins of
Jeroboam, @ made @ to sin.

10:32 In @J days the LORD began to cut @ short: and Hazael
smote them in all the coasts of @; 10:33 From Jordan eastward,
all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the
Manassites, from Aroer, @ is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and
Bashan.

10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
his @B, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of @?  10:35 And Jehu slept with his @s: and they
buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

10:36 And the time that Jehu reigned over @ in Samaria was twenty
and eight @8.

11:1 And when Athaliah the m@C of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from @ the king's
sons @ were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in
the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.

11:3 And he was with her hid in the @ of the LORD six @8. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.

11:4 And the @Hth year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
@/s, with the captains and the guard, and @ them to him
into the @ of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an
oath of them in the @ of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.

11:5 And he @M them, @, This is the @7 that ye @
do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath @ even be
keepers of the watch of the king's @; 11:6 And a third part @

so @ ye keep the watch of the @, that it be not broken down.

11:7 And two parts of all you that go @ on the sabbath, even they
@ keep the watch of the @ of the LORD @+ the king.

11:8 And ye @ compass the king round @+, @ man with his
weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be
slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.

11:9 And the captains over the @/s did @$ to all @
that Jehoiada the @6 @M: and they took @ man his men
that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that @# go out on
the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the @6.

11:10 And to the captains over @/s did the @6 give king
@'s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.

11:11 And the guard stood, @ man with his weapons in his hand,
round @+ the king, from the @c corner of the temple to the left
corner of the temple, along by the @\ and the temple.

11:12 And he @ @ the king's son, and put the crown upon him,
and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him;
and they clapped @ @D, and said, God save the king.

11:13 And when Athaliah @) the noise of the guard and of the
@, she came to the @ into the temple of the LORD.

11:14 And when she looked, @%, the king stood by a pillar, as the
manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all
the @ of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah
rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.

11:15 But Jehoiada the @6 @M the captains of the @/s,
the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her @ @S
the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the @Q. For the
@6 had said, Let her not be slain in the @ of the LORD.

11:16 And they laid @D on her; and she went by the way by the @
the horses came into the king's @: and @ was she slain.

11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
the @, that they @# be the LORD's @; between the king
also and the @.

11:18 And all the @ of the land went into the @ of Baal, and
brake it down; his @\s and his images brake they in pieces
thoroughly, and slew Mattan the @6 of Baal @	 the @\s. And
the @6 appointed officers over the @ of the LORD.

11:19 And he took the rulers over @/s, and the captains, and the
guard, and all the @ of the land; and they @ down the king
from the @ of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the
guard to the king's @. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

11:20 And all the @ of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the @Q beside the king's @.

11:21 Seven @8 old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

12:1 In the @Hth year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
@8 reigned he in @ . And his m@C's name was Zibiah of
Beersheba.

12:2 And Jehoash did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD all
his days wherein Jehoiada the @6 instructed him.

12:3 But the high @'s were not taken away: the @ still
sacrificed and @_ incense in the high @'s.

12:4 And Jehoash said to the @6s, All the money of the dedicated

@ one that passeth the account, the money that @ man is set

wheresoever any breach @ be @V.

12:6 But it was so, that in the @@ and twentieth year of king
Jehoash the @6s had not repaired the breaches of the @.

12:7 Then king Jehoash @, for Jehoiada the @6, and the @C
@6s, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the
@? now @fore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but
deliver it for the breaches of the @.

12:8 And the @6s consented to receive no more money of the @,
@" to repair the breaches of the @.

12:9 But Jehoiada the @6 took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid
of it, and set it beside the @\, on the @c side as one cometh
into the @ of the LORD: and the @6s that kept the door put
@in all the money that was @ into the @ of the LORD.

12:10 And it was so, when they saw that @ was much money in the
chest, that the king's scribe and the high @6 came up, and they
put up in bags, and told the money that was @V in the @ of the
LORD.

12:11 And they gave the money, being told, into the @D of them that
did the work, that had the oversight of the @ of the LORD: and
they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the
@ of the LORD, 12:12 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to
buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the @ of the
LORD, and for all that was laid out for the @ to repair it.

12:13 Howbeit @ were not made for the @ of the LORD bowls of
silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of
silver, of the money that was @ into the @ of the LORD:
12:14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired @with the
@ of the LORD.

12:15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
faithfully.

12:16 The trespass money and sin money was not @ into the @
of the LORD: it was the @6s'.

12:17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought @
 Gath, and
took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to @ .

12:18 And Jehoash king of @ took all the hallowed @ that
Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his @s, kings of @,
had dedicated, and his own hallowed @, and all the gold that was
@V in the treasures of the @ of the LORD, and in the king's

12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
12:20 And his @<s arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in
the @ of Millo, @ goeth down to Silla.

12:21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
Shomer, his @<s, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with
his @s in the city of @: and Amaziah his son reigned in his

13:1 In the @@ and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king
of @ Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over @ in
Samaria, and reigned @Hteen @8.

13:2 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, @ made @ to
sin; he departed not @from.

13:3 And the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 @, and he
delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the
hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all @ days.

13:4 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:
for he saw the oppression of @, @ the king of Syria
oppressed them.

13:5 (And the LORD gave @ a saviour, so that they went out from

@ tents, as @	time.

13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the @ of

13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
his @B, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the

buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

13:10 In the thirty and @Hth year of Joash king of @ began
Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over @ in Samaria, and
reigned sixteen @8.

13:11 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made

13:12 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
@B wherewith he fought @
 Amaziah king of @, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  13:13
And Joash slept with his @s; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of @.

13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
Joash the king of @ came down unto him, and wept over his face,
and said, O my @, my @, the chariot of @, and the

13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto

13:16 And he said to the king of @, Put @ hand upon the bow.
And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his @D upon the king's

13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's
deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou @
smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.

13:18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto

stayed.

13:19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou @#est

13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the

13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, @%,
they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of

13:23 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,

13:24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in

13:25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took @* out of the hand of

14:4 Howbeit the high @'s were not taken away: as yet the @
did sacrifice and @_ incense on the high @'s.

14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
hand, that he slew his @<s @ had slain the king his @.

14:6 But the @ of the murderers he slew not: @$ unto
that @ is written in the book of the law of @, wherein the
LORD @M, @, The @s @ not be put to @^ for the

man @ be put to @^ for his own sin.

14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten @:, and took
Selah by war, and @, the name of it Joktheel unto this day.

14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
of Jehu, king of @, @, Come, let us look one @F in the
face.

14:9 And Jehoash the king of @ sent to Amaziah king of @,
@, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in
Lebanon, @, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and @ passed

14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and @ @ hath lifted thee

14:11 But Amaziah @L not hear. @N Jehoash king of @
went up; and he and Amaziah king of @ looked one @F in the

14:12 And @ was put to the worse @	 @; and they fled
@ man to @ tents.

14:13 And Jehoash king of @ took Amaziah king of @, the son
of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to @ ,
and brake down the wall of @  from the gate of Ephraim unto the
corner gate, four @/ cubits.

14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
were @V in the @ of the LORD, and in the treasures of the
king's @, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash @ he did, and his @B,
and how he fought with Amaziah king of @, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  14:16 And Jehoash
slept with his @s, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of
@; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.

14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of @ lived @ the @^
of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of @ fifteen @8.

14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  14:19 Now they made a
conspiracy @
 him in @ : and he fled to Lachish; but they
sent @ him to Lachish, and slew him @.

14:20 And they @ him on horses: and he was buried at @

14:21 And all the @ of @ took Azariah, @ was sixteen
@8 old, and made him king instead of his @ Amaziah.

14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to @, @ that the king
slept with his @s.

14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of @
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of @ began to reign in Samaria,
and reigned forty and one @8.

14:24 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
@ to sin.

14:25 He restored the coast of @ from the entering of Hamath unto
the sea of the plain, @$ to the word of the LORD God of @,
@ he @0 by the hand of his @< Jonah, the son of Amittai,

14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of @, that it was very
bitter: for @ was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper
for @.

14:27 And the LORD said not that he @L blot out the name of @
from @[ @1: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son
of Joash.

14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
his @B, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,
@ belonged to @, for @, are they not written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of @?  14:29 And Jeroboam slept
with his @s, even with the kings of @; and Zachariah his son
reigned in his stead.

15:1 In the twenty and @Hth year of Jeroboam king of @ began
Azariah son of Amaziah king of @ to reign.

15:2 Sixteen @8 old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
two and fifty @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was Jecholiah

15:3 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD,
@$ to all that his @ Amaziah had done; 15:4 Save that the
high @'s were not removed: the @ sacrificed and @_ incense
still on the high @'s.

15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
of his @^, and dwelt in a several @. And Jotham the king's son
was over the @, judging the @ of the land.

15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
15:7 So Azariah slept with his @s; and they buried him with his
@s in the city of @: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

15:8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of @ did
Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over @ in Samaria six months.

15:9 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
@s had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made @ to sin.

15:10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired @
 him, and smote
him @	 the @, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, @%, they are written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @.

15:12 This was the word of the LORD @ he @0 unto Jehu, @,
Thy sons @ sit on the throne of @ unto the fourth generation.
And so it came to pass.

15:13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
thirtieth year of Uzziah king of @; and he reigned a full month in
Samaria.

15:14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,
and reigned in his stead.

15:15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy @ he
made, @%, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of @.

15:16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were @in, and the
coasts @of from Tirzah: @ they opened not to him, @fore
he smote it; and all the women @in that were with child he ripped
up.

15:17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of @ began
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over @, and reigned ten @8 in
Samaria.

15:18 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
who made @ to sin.

15:19 And Pul the king of Assyria came @
 the land: and Menahem
gave Pul a @: talents of silver, that his hand @B be with him
to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

15:20 And Menahem exacted the money of @, even of all the @By
men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the
king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not
@ in the land.

15:21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
15:22 And Menahem slept with his @s; and Pekahiah his son reigned
in his stead.

15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of @ Pekahiah the son
of Menahem began to reign over @ in Samaria, and reigned two
@8.

15:24 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
@ to sin.

15:25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
@
 him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's
@, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:
and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

15:26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
@%, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
@.

15:27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of @ Pekah the
son of Remaliah began to reign over @ in Samaria, and reigned
twenty @8.

15:28 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
@ to sin.

15:29 In the days of Pekah king of @ came Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh,
and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and
carried them captive to Assyria.

15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy @
 Pekah the
son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his
stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

15:31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, @%,
they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @.

15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of @
began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of @ to reign.

15:33 Five and twenty @8 old was he when he began to reign, and he
reigned sixteen @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok.

15:34 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD: he did
@$ to all that his @ Uzziah had done.

15:35 Howbeit the high @'s were not removed: the @ sacrificed
and burned incense still in the high @'s. He built the higher gate
of the @ of the LORD.

15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?
15:37 In @J days the LORD began to send @
 @ Rezin the
king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

15:38 And Jotham slept with his @s, and was buried with his
@s in the city of @ his @: and Ahaz his son reigned in
his stead.

16:1 In the @Hteenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son
of Jotham king of @ began to reign.

16:2 Twenty @8 old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
sixteen @8 in @ , and did not that @ was @c in the
sight of the LORD his God, like @ his @.

16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of @, yea, and made
his son to pass @E the fire, @$ to the abominations of the
heathen, whom the LORD cast out from @	 the @ of @.

16:4 And he sacrificed and @_ incense in the high @'s, and on
the hills, and @[ @ green tree.

16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of @
came up to @  to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not
overcome him.

16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt
@ unto this day.

16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
@, I am thy @< and thy son: come up, and save me out of the
hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of @,
@ rise up @
 me.

16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was @V in the @ of
the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's @, and sent it for a
present to the king of Assyria.

16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
Assyria went up @
 Damascus, and took it, and carried the @
of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and saw an @\ that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to
Urijah the @6 the fashion of the @\, and the pattern of it,
@$ to all the workmanship @of.

16:11 And Urijah the @6 built an @\ @$ to all that king
Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the @6 made it @
 king
Ahaz came from Damascus.

16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
@\: and the king approached to the @\, and offered @on.

16:13 And he @_ his @_ @& and his meat @&, and
poured his @b @&, and sprinkled the @I of his @U
@&s, upon the @\.

16:14 And he @ also the brasen @\, @ was @	 the LORD,
from the forefront of the @, from between the @\ and the @
of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the @\.

16:15 And king Ahaz @M Urijah the @6, @, Upon the
@ @\ burn the morning @_ @&, and the evening meat
@&, and the king's @_ sacrifice, and his meat @&, with
the @_ @& of all the @ of the land, and @ meat

the brasen @\ @ be for me to enquire by.

16:16 Thus did Urijah the @6, @$ to all that king Ahaz
@M.

16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
that were @[ it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.

16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the @,
and the king's entry @S, turned he from the @ of the LORD for
the king of Assyria.

16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz @ he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  16:20
And Ahaz slept with his @s, and was buried with his @s in
the city of @: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of @ began Hoshea the son of
Elah to reign in Samaria over @ nine @8.

17:2 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not
as the kings of @ that were @	 him.

17:3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
became his @<, and gave him presents.

17:4 And the king of Assyria @V conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
sent messengers to So king of @-, and @ no present to the
king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: @fore the king of
Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

17:5 Then the king of Assyria came up @Eout all the land, and
went up to Samaria, and besieged it @@ @8.

17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
carried @ away into Assyria, and @'d them in Halah and in
Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the @G of the Medes.

17:7 For so it was, that the @ of @ had sinned @
 the
LORD @ God, @ had @ them up out of the land of @-,
from @[ the hand of Pharaoh king of @-, and had feared @C
gods, 17:8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD
cast out from @	 the @ of @, and of the kings of
@, @ they had made.

17:9 And the @ of @ did secretly @J @ that were
not @c @
 the LORD @ God, and they built them high @'s
in all @ @G, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced
city.

17:10 And they set them up images and groves in @ high hill, and
@[ @ green tree: 17:11 And @ they @_ incense in all the
high @'s, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away @	
them; and wrought wicked @ to provoke the LORD to anger: 17:12
For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye @
not do this @7.

17:13 Yet the LORD testified @
 @, and @
 @, by all
the prophets, and by all the seers, @, Turn ye from your evil
ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, @$ to all the
law @ I @M your @s, and @ I sent to you by my
@<s the prophets.

17:14 Notwithstanding they @L not hear, but hardened @ necks,
like to the neck of @ @s, that did not believe in the LORD
@ God.

17:15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
with @ @s, and his testimonies @ he testified @

them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went @ the
heathen that were round @+ them, concerning whom the LORD had
charged them, that they @# not do like them.

17:16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD @ God, and
made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and
worshipped all the host of @1, and served Baal.

17:17 And they caused @ sons and @ daughters to pass @E
the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold @T to
do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

17:18 @N the LORD was very angry with @, and removed them
out of his sight: @ was none left but the tribe of @ only.

17:19 Also @ kept not the commandments of the LORD @ God, but
walked in the statutes of @ @ they made.

17:20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of @, and afflicted
them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast
them out of his sight.

17:21 For he rent @ from the @ of @; and they made
Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave @ from
following the LORD, and made them sin a @ sin.

17:22 For the @ of @ walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
@ he did; they departed not from them; 17:23 Until the LORD
removed @ out of his sight, as he had said by all his @<s
the prophets. So was @ carried away out of @ own land to
Assyria unto this day.

17:24 And the king of Assyria @ men from Babylon, and from
Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and @'d
them in the @G of Samaria instead of the @ of @: and
they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the @G @of.

17:25 And so it was at the beginning of @ dwelling @, that
they feared not the LORD: @fore the LORD sent lions @ them,
@ slew some of them.

17:26 Wherefore they @0 to the king of Assyria, @, The nations
@ thou hast removed, and @'d in the @G of Samaria, know not
the manner of the God of the land: @fore he hath sent lions @
them, and, @%, they slay them, @ they know not the manner of
the God of the land.

17:27 Then the king of Assyria @M, @, Carry thither one of
the @6s whom ye @ from thence; and let them go and dwell
@, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.

17:28 Then one of the @6s whom they had carried away from Samaria
came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they @# fear the
LORD.

17:29 Howbeit @ nation made gods of @ own, and put them in the
@s of the high @'s @ the Samaritans had made, @ nation
in @ @G wherein they dwelt.

17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 17:31 And the Avites
made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites @_ @ @ in
fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto @T of the lowest
of them @6s of the high @'s, @ sacrificed for them in the
@s of the high @'s.

17:33 They feared the LORD, and served @ own gods, @ the
manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

17:34 Unto this day they do @ the former manners: they fear not
the LORD, @" do they @ @ statutes, or @ @
ordinances, or @ the law and commandment @ the LORD @M
the @ of @], whom he named @; 17:35 With whom the LORD
had made a covenant, and charged them, @, Ye @ not fear @C

them: 17:36 But the LORD, who @ you up out of the land of @-
with @ power and a stretched out arm, him @ ye fear, and him
@ ye worship, and to him @ ye do sacrifice.

17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the

17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye @ not forget;
@" @ ye fear @C gods.

17:39 But the LORD your God ye @ fear; and he @ deliver you
out of the hand of all your enemies.

17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did @ @ former
manner.

17:41 So @ nations feared the LORD, and served @ graven
images, both @ @, and @ @'s @: as did
@ @s, so do they unto this day.

18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
of @, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of @ began to reign.

18:2 Twenty and five @8 old was he when he began to reign; and he
reigned twenty and nine @8 in @ . His m@C's name also was
Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

18:3 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD,
@$ to all that @ his @ did.

18:4 He removed the high @'s, and brake the images, and cut down
the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that @ had
made: for unto @J days the @ of @ did burn incense to
it: and he @, it Nehushtan.

18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of @; so that @ him was none
like him @ all the kings of @, nor any that were @	 him.

18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
but kept his commandments, @ the LORD @M @.

18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
@: and he rebelled @
 the king of Assyria, and served him
not.

18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
@of, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, @
was the @Hth year of Hoshea son of Elah king of @, that
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up @
 Samaria, and besieged it.

18:10 And at the end of @@ @8 they took it: even in the sixth
year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of @,
Samaria was taken.

18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away @ unto Assyria, and
put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the
@G of the Medes: 18:12 Because they obeyed not the @; of the
LORD @ God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that @ the
@< of the LORD @M, and @L not hear them, nor do them.

18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
of Assyria come up @
 all the fenced @G of @, and took
them.

18:14 And Hezekiah king of @ sent to the king of Assyria to
Lachish, @, I have offended; return from me: that @ thou
puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto
Hezekiah king of @ @@ @/ talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold.

18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was @V in the @
of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's @.

18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
temple of the LORD, and from the pillars @ Hezekiah king of @
had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a @ host @
 @ . And
they went up and came to @ . And when they were come up, they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, @ is in the
highway of the fuller's field.

18:18 And when they had @, to the king, @ came out to them
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, @ was over the @hold, and Shebna
the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
@
 the @ king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this
wherein thou trustest?  18:20 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain
@5,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou
trust, that thou rebellest @
 me?  18:21 Now, @%, thou
trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon @-, on
@ if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is
Pharaoh king of @- unto all that trust on him.

18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that
he, whose high @'s and whose @\s Hezekiah hath taken away, and
hath said to @ and @ , Ye @ worship @	 this @\
in @ ?  18:23 Now @fore, I pray thee, give pledges to my
lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two @: horses,
if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my master's @<s, and put thy trust on @- for chariots
and for horsemen?  18:25 Am I now come up @S the LORD @

this @' to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up @
 this
land, and destroy it.

18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy @<s in the Syrian language;
for we @[stand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in
the ears of the @ that are on the wall.

18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
master, and to thee, to @K @ @5? hath he not sent me to the
men @ sit on the wall, that they may eat @ own dung, and @b
@ own piss with you?  18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a
loud @; in the Jews' language, and @0, @, Hear the word of
the @ king, the king of Assyria: 18:29 Thus @
 the king, Let
not Hezekiah deceive you: for he @ not be able to deliver you out
of his hand: 18:30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,
@, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city @ not be
delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus @
 the king of Assyria,
Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then
eat ye @ man of his own vine, and @ one of his fig tree, and
@b ye @ one the @Zs of his cistern: 18:32 Until I come and
take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a
land of @d and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye
may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he
persuadeth you, @, The LORD will deliver us.

18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  18:34 Where are the gods of
Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and
Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?  18:35 Who are
they @ all the gods of the countries, that have delivered @
country out of mine hand, that the LORD @# deliver @  out
of mine hand?  18:36 But the @ held @ @U, and @> him
not a word: for the king's commandment was, @, Answer him not.

18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, @ was over the
@hold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the
recorder, to Hezekiah with @ clothes rent, and told him the @5
of Rabshakeh.

19:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah @) it, that he rent
his clothes, and covered @9 with sackcloth, and went into the
@ of the LORD.

19:2 And he sent Eliakim, @ was over the @hold, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the @6s, covered with sackcloth, to
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

19:3 And they said unto him, Thus @
 Hezekiah, This day is a day of
trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the @ are come to
the birth, and @ is not strength to @( @.

19:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the @5 of Rabshakeh,
whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living
God; and will reprove the @5 @ the LORD thy God hath @):
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.

19:5 So the @<s of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus @ ye say to your master, Thus
@
 the LORD, Be not afraid of the @5 @ thou hast @), with
@ the @<s of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

19:7 @., I will send a blast upon him, and he @ hear a rumour,
and @ return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the
@Q in his own land.

19:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and @V the king of Assyria warring
@
 Libnah: for he had @) that he was departed from Lachish.

19:9 And when he @) say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, @., he is
come out to fight @
 thee: he sent messengers @* unto
Hezekiah, @, 19:10 Thus @ ye @K to Hezekiah king of @,
@, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, @,
@  @ not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

19:11 @., thou hast @) what the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands, by destroying them utterly: and @ thou be delivered?
19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them @ my @s
have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the @ of
Eden @ were in Thelasar?  19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and
the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,
and Ivah?  19:14 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the @ of the
LORD, and spread it @	 the LORD.

19:15 And Hezekiah prayed @	 the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
@, @ dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even
thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the @; thou hast made @1
and @.

19:16 LORD, bow down @ ear, and hear: open, LORD, @ eyes, and
see: and hear the @5 of Sennacherib, @ hath sent him to
reproach the living God.

19:17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
nations and @ lands, 19:18 And have cast @ gods into the fire:
for they were no gods, but the work of men's @D, wood and stone:
@fore they have destroyed them.

19:19 Now @fore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out
of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the @ may know that thou art
the LORD God, even thou only.

19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, @, Thus @

the LORD God of @, That @ thou hast prayed to me @

Sennacherib king of Assyria I have @).

19:21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of @  hath shaken her head at thee.

19:22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and @
 whom hast
thou exalted thy @;, and lifted up @ eyes on high? even @

the Holy One of @.

19:23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,
With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the
mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar
trees @of, and the choice fir trees @of: and I will enter into
the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.

19:24 I have digged and drunk strange @Zs, and with the sole of my
feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged @'s.

19:25 Hast thou not @) long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
times that I have formed it? now have I @ it to pass, that thou
@#est be to lay waste fenced @G into ruinous heaps.

19:26 @N @ inhabitants were of small power, they were
dismayed and con@Ved; they were as the grass of the field, and as
the green herb, as the grass on the @ tops, and as corn blasted
@	 it be grown up.

19:27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
thy rage @
 me.

19:28 Because thy rage @
 me and thy tumult is come up into mine
ears, @fore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy
lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by @ thou camest.

19:29 And this @ be a sign unto thee, Ye @ eat this year such
@ as grow of @T, and in the second year that @
springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and
plant vineyards, and eat the fruits @of.

19:30 And the remnant that is escaped of the @ of @ @ yet
@* take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

19:31 For out of @  @ go @ a remnant, and they that
escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts @ do this.

19:32 @N thus @
 the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
@ not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow @, nor come
@	 it with shield, nor cast a bank @
 it.

19:33 By the way that he came, by the same @ he return, and @
not come into this city, @
 the LORD.

19:34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and
for my @< @'s sake.

19:35 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went
out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an @/ fourscore and
five @:: and when they arose early in the morning, @%, they
were all dead corpses.

19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
and dwelt at Nineveh.

19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the @ of
Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with
the @Q: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead.

20:1 In @J days was Hezekiah sick unto @^. And the prophet
Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus @
 the
LORD, Set @ @ in order; for thou @ die, and not live.

20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
@, 20:3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked
@	 thee in truth and with a perfect @, and have done that
@ is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
court, that the word of the LORD came to him, @, 20:5 Turn @*,
and tell Hezekiah the captain of my @, Thus @
 the LORD, the
God of @ thy @, I have @) thy prayer, I have seen thy
tears: @%, I will heal thee: on the third day thou @ go up
unto the @ of the LORD.

20:6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen @8; and I will deliver
thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will
defend this city for mine own sake, and for my @< @'s sake.

20:7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it
on the boil, and he recovered.

20:8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What @ be the sign that the
LORD will heal me, and that I @ go up into the @ of the LORD
the third day?  20:9 And Isaiah said, This sign @ thou have of the
LORD, that the LORD will do the @7 that he hath spoken: @ the
shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?  20:10 And
Hezekiah @>, It is a light @7 for the shadow to go down ten
degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.

20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he @ the
shadow ten degrees backward, by @ it had gone down in the dial of
Ahaz.

20:12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had @)
that Hezekiah had been sick.

20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the @
of his precious @, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and
the precious ointment, and all the @ of his armour, and all that
was @V in his treasures: @ was no@7 in his @, nor in all
his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

20:14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
him, What said @ men? and from whence came they unto thee? And
Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.

20:15 And he said, What have they seen in @ @? And Hezekiah
@>, All the @ that are in mine @ have they seen: @
is no@7 @ my treasures that I have not shewed them.

20:16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

20:17 @., the days come, that all that is in @ @, and that
@ thy @s have laid up in store unto this day, @ be
carried into Babylon: no@7 @ be left, @
 the LORD.

20:18 And of thy sons that @ issue from thee, @ thou @
beget, @ they take away; and they @ be eunuchs in the palace
of the king of Babylon.

20:19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
@ thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if @U and
truth be in my days?  20:20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and
all his @B, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and @
@Z into the city, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of @?  20:21 And Hezekiah slept with his
@s: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

21:1 Manasseh was twelve @8 old when he began to reign, and reigned
fifty and five @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was
Hephzibah.

21:2 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, @
the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out @	 the
@ of @.

21:3 For he built up @* the high @'s @ Hezekiah his @
had destroyed; and he reared up @\s for Baal, and made a grove, as
did Ahab king of @; and worshipped all the host of @1, and
served them.

21:4 And he built @\s in the @ of the LORD, of @ the LORD
said, In @  will I put my name.

21:5 And he built @\s for all the host of @1 in the two courts
of the @ of the LORD.

21:6 And he made his son pass @E the fire, and observed times,
and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
anger.

21:7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
@, of @ the LORD said to @, and to Solomon his son, In
this @, and in @ , @ I have chosen out of all tribes of
@, will I put my name for ever: 21:8 Neither will I make the feet
of @ move any more out of the land @ I gave @ @s;
only if they will observe to do @$ to all that I have @M
them, and @$ to all the law that my @< @ @M
them.

21:9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed @	 the @ of
@.

21:10 And the LORD @0 by his @<s the prophets, @, 21:11
Because Manasseh king of @ hath done @ abominations, and hath
done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, @ were @	 him,
and hath made @ also to sin with his idols: 21:12 @N thus
@
 the LORD God of @, @., I am @(ing such evil upon
@  and @, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears @
tingle.

21:13 And I will stretch over @  the line of Samaria, and the
plummet of the @ of Ahab: and I will wipe @  as a man
wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

21:14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver
them into the hand of @ enemies; and they @ become a prey and
a spoil to all @ enemies; 21:15 Because they have done that @
was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day
@ @s came @ out of @-, even unto this day.

21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent @I very much, till he had
filled @  from one end to @F; beside his sin wherewith he
made @ to sin, in doing that @ was evil in the sight of the
LORD.

21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of @?  21:18 And Manasseh slept with his
@s, and was buried in the garden of his own @, in the garden
of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

21:19 Amon was twenty and two @8 old when he began to reign, and he
reigned two @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was
Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

21:20 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
@ Manasseh did.

21:21 And he walked in all the way that his @ walked in, and
served the idols that his @ served, and worshipped them: 21:22
And he forsook the LORD God of his @s, and walked not in the way
of the LORD.

21:23 And the @<s of Amon conspired @
 him, and slew the
king in his own @.

21:24 And the @ of the land slew all them that had conspired
@
 king Amon; and the @ of the land made Josiah his son king
in his stead.

21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon @ he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of @?  21:26
And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah
his son reigned in his stead.

22:1 Josiah was eight @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
thirty and one @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was Jedidah,
the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

22:2 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in all the way of @ his @, and turned not aside to the
@c hand or to the left.

22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that
the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the
scribe, to the @ of the LORD, @, 22:4 Go up to Hilkiah the
high @6, that he may sum the silver @ is @ into the
@ of the LORD, @ the keepers of the door have ga@d of the
@: 22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
work, that have the oversight of the @ of the LORD: and let them
give it to the doers of the work @ is in the @ of the LORD, to
repair the breaches of the @, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,
and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the @.

22:7 Howbeit @ was no reckoning made with them of the money that
was delivered into @ hand, @ they dealt faithfully.

22:8 And Hilkiah the high @6 said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
@V the book of the law in the @ of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave
the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and @ the king
word @*, and said, Thy @<s have ga@d the money that was
@V in the @, and have delivered it into the hand of them that
do the work, that have the oversight of the @ of the LORD.

22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, @, Hilkiah the
@6 hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it @	 the king.

22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had @) the @5 of the
book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

22:12 And the king @M Hilkiah the @6, and Ahikam the son of
Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and
Asahiah a @< of the king's, @, 22:13 Go ye, enquire of the
LORD for me, and for the @, and for all @, concerning the
@5 of this book that is @V: for @ is the wrath of the LORD
that is kindled @
 us, @ our @s have not hearkened
unto the @5 of this book, to do @$ unto all that @ is
written concerning us.

22:14 So Hilkiah the @6, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son
of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt
in @  in the college;) and they communed with her.

22:15 And she said unto them, Thus @
 the LORD God of @, Tell
the man that sent you to me, 22:16 Thus @
 the LORD, @., I will
@( evil upon this @', and upon the inhabitants @of, even all
the @5 of the book @ the king of @ hath read: 22:17 Because
they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto @C gods, that
they @B provoke me to anger with all the works of @ @D;
@fore my wrath @ be kindled @
 this @', and @ not
be quenched.

22:18 But to the king of @ @ sent you to enquire of the LORD,
thus @ ye say to him, Thus @
 the LORD God of @, As
touching the @5 @ thou hast @); 22:19 Because @ @
was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself @	 the LORD, when thou
@)est what I @0 @

 the inhabitants
@of, that they @# become a desolation and a curse, and hast
rent thy clothes, and wept @	 me; I also have @) thee, @

the LORD.

22:20 @. @fore, I will gather thee unto thy @s, and thou
@ be ga@d into thy grave in @U; and @ eyes @ not
see all the evil @ I will @( upon this @'. And they @
the king word @*.

23:1 And the king sent, and they ga@d unto him all the elders of
@ and of @ .

23:2 And the king went up into the @ of the LORD, and all the men
of @ and all the inhabitants of @  with him, and the
@6s, and the prophets, and all the @, both small and @:
and he read in @ ears all the @5 of the book of the covenant
@ was @V in the @ of the LORD.

23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant @	 the
LORD, to walk @ the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all @ @ and all @ soul,
to perform the @5 of this covenant that were written in this book.
And all the @ stood to the covenant.

23:4 And the king @M Hilkiah the high @6, and the @6s
of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to @( @ out
of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and
for the grove, and for all the host of @1: and he burned them
@S @  in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of
them unto Bethel.

23:5 And he put down the idolatrous @6s, whom the kings of @
had ordained to burn incense in the high @'s in the @G of
@, and in the @'s round @+ @ ; them also that burned
incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,
and to all the host of @1.

23:6 And he @ out the grove from the @ of the LORD, @S
@ , unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron,
and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder @of upon the
graves of the @ of the @.

23:7 And he brake down the @s of the sodomites, that were by the
@ of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

23:8 And he @ all the @6s out of the @G of @, and
defiled the high @'s where the @6s had burned incense, from
Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high @'s of the gates that
were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the
city, @ were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.

23:9 Nevertheless the @6s of the high @'s came not up to the
@\ of the LORD in @ , but they did eat of the unleavened

23:10 And he defiled Topheth, @ is in the valley of the @
of Hinnom, that no man @B make his son or his daughter to pass
@E the fire to Molech.

23:11 And he took away the horses that the kings of @ had @= to
the sun, at the entering in of the @ of the LORD, by the chamber
of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, @ was in the suburbs, and burned
the chariots of the sun with fire.

23:12 And the @\s that were on the top of the upper chamber of
Ahaz, @ the kings of @ had made, and the @\s @ Manasseh
had made in the two courts of the @ of the LORD, did the king beat
down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into
the brook Kidron.

23:13 And the high @'s that were @	 @ , @ were on
the @c hand of the mount of corruption, @ Solomon the king of
@ had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and

23:14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
filled @ @'s with the bones of men.

23:15 Moreover the @\ that was at Bethel, and the high @' @
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made @ to sin, had made, both that

stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.

23:16 And as Josiah turned @9, he spied the sepulchres that were

23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they

23:19 And all the @s also of the high @'s that were in the

23:21 And the king @M all the @, @, Keep the passover

23:22 Surely @ was not holden such a passover from the days of the

23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are

23:29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of @- went up @
 the king

and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

23:30 And his @<s carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
@ him to @ , and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the

23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty and @@ @8 old when he began to reign;

23:32 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD,

23:33 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of

23:34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the

Jehoahaz away: and he came to @-, and died @.

23:35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he

24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are

24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his @s: and Jehoiachin his son

24:7 And the king of @- came not @* any more out of his land:

24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen @8 old when he began to reign, and he

24:10 At that time the @<s of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came

24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came @

24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of @ went out to the king of
Babylon, he, and his m@C, and his @<s, and his princes, and

24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's

24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his @'s @X king

24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one @8 old when he began to reign,
and he reigned eleven @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was

24:19 And he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD,

24:20 For @E the anger of the LORD it came to pass in @

25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth

Babylon came, he, and all his host, @
 @ , and pitched
@
 it; and they built forts @
 it round @+.

25:2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
Zedekiah.

25:3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in
the city, and @ was no @d for the @ of the land.

25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night
by the way of the gate between two walls, @ is by the king's
garden: (now the Chaldees were @
 the city round @+:) and the
king went the way toward the plain.

25:5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued @ the king, and overtook
him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from
him.

25:6 So they took the king, and @ him up to the king of Babylon
to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

25:7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah @	 his eyes, and put out
the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried

25:8 And in the fifth month, on the @Hth day of the month, @ is

25:11 Now the rest of the @ that were left in the city, and the

25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the

25:13 And the pillars of brass that were in the @ of the LORD, and

the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to
Babylon.

25:14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,

25:15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such @ as were of

And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of

25:22 And as for the @ that remained in the land of @, whom

12:33 Of Zebulun, such as went @ to battle, expert in war, with

12:34 And of Naphtali a @: captains, and with them with shield

12:36 And of Asher, such as went @ to battle, expert in war, forty

12:37 And on the @C side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the

12:38 All @ men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect

also of @ were of one @ to make @ king.

12:39 And @ they were with @ @@ days, eating and @bing:

12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
Zebulun and Naphtali, @ @d on asses, and on camels, and on
mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of
raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for @
was joy in @.

13:1 And @ consulted with the captains of @:s and @/s,
and with @ leader.

13:2 And @ said unto all the @` of @, If it seem
good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad
unto our @3 @ where, that are left in all the land of
@, and with them also to the @6s and Levites @ are in
@ @G and suburbs, that they may gather @T unto us:
13:3 And let us @( @* the ark of our God to us: for we enquired
not at it in the days of Saul.

13:4 And all the @` said that they @L do so: for the
@7 was @c in the eyes of all the @.

13:5 So @ ga@d all @ @?, from Shihor of @- even

Kirjathjearim.

13:6 And @ went up, and all @, to Baalah, that is, to
Kirjathjearim, @ belonged to @, to @( up thence the ark of
God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is

13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the @ of
Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

13:8 And @ and all @ played @	 God with all @ @B,
and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
@ his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 Uzza, and he smote
him, @ he put his hand to the ark: and @ he died @	 God.

13:11 And @ was displeased, @ the LORD had made a breach
upon Uzza: wherefore that @' is @, Perezuzza to this day.

13:12 And @ was afraid of God that day, @, How @ I @(

Obededom the Gittite.

13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
@ @@ months. And the LORD blessed the @ of Obededom, and
all that he had.

14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to @, and timber of
cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an @.

14:2 And @ perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
@, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, @ of his @
@.

14:3 And @ took more wives at @ : and @ begat more sons

14:4 Now @ are the names of his @ @ he had in

And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

14:8 And when the Philistines @) that @ was anointed king over
all @, all the Philistines went up to seek @. And @ @)
of it, and went out @

14:9 And the Philistines came and spread @T in the valley of
Rephaim.

14:10 And @ enquired of God, @, Shall I go up @
 the
Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD
said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into @ hand.

14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and @ smote them @. Then
@ said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the
breaking @ of @Zs: @fore they @, the name of that @'
Baalperazim.

14:12 And when they had left @ gods @, @ gave a

14:13 And the Philistines yet @* spread @T abroad in the
valley.

14:14 @N @ enquired @* of God; and God said unto him, Go

14:15 And it @ be, when thou @ hear a sound of going in the

God is gone @ @	 thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

14:16 @ @fore did as God @M him: and they smote the
host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

14:17 And the fame of @ went out into all lands; and the LORD
@ the fear of him upon all nations.

15:1 And @ made him @s in the city of @, and prepared a
@' for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

15:2 Then @ said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to
minister unto him for ever.

15:3 And @ ga@d all @ @? to @ , to @( up
the ark of the LORD unto his @', @ he had prepared for it.

15:4 And @ assembled the @ of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5
Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his @3 an @/

Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his @3 an

15:11 And @ @, for Zadok and Abiathar the @6s, and for the
Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and
Amminadab, 15:12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the @s
of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your @3, that
ye may @( up the ark of the LORD God of @ unto the @' that
I have prepared for it.

15:13 For @ ye did it not at the @O, the LORD our God made a
breach upon us, for that we sought him not @ the due order.

15:14 So the @6s and the Levites sanctified @T to @( up
the ark of the LORD God of @.

15:15 And the @ of the Levites bare the ark of God upon @
@#ers with the staves @on, as @ @M @$ to the
word of the LORD.

15:16 And @ @0 to the chief of the Levites to appoint @
@3 to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and
harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the @; with joy.

15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
@3, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari @
@3, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 15:18 And with them @
@3 of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah,
and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel,
the porters.

15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
with cymbals of brass; 15:20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and
Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 15:21 And Mattithiah, and
Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with
harps on the Sheminith to excel.

15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
@+ the song, @ he was skilful.

15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the @6s, did blow with the
trumpets @	 the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were
doorkeepers for the ark.

15:25 So @, and the elders of @, and the captains over
@:s, went to @( up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of
the @ of Obededom with joy.

15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered @H bullocks and
@H rams.

15:27 And @ was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master
of the song with the singers: @ also had upon him an ephod of
linen.

15:28 Thus all @ @ up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and
with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
to the city of @, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at
a window saw king @ dancing and playing: and she despised him in
her @.

16:1 So they @ the ark of God, and set it in the @a of the
tent that @ had pitched for it: and they offered @_ sacrifices
and @U @&s @	 God.

16:2 And when @ had made an end of @& the @_ @&s
and the @U @&s, he blessed the @ in the name of the
LORD.

16:3 And he dealt to @ one of @, both man and woman, to @
one a loaf of @d, and a good piece of @R, and a flagon of wine.

16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister @	 the
ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God
of @: 16:5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and
Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a
sound with cymbals; 16:6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the @6s with
trumpets continually @	 the ark of the covenant of God.

16:7 Then on that day @ delivered @O this psalm to thank the
LORD into the hand of Asaph and his @3.

16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
deeds @ the @.

16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
works.

16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the @ of them rejoice that

16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
and the judgments of his @P; 16:13 O ye seed of @ his @<,
ye @ of @], his chosen ones.

16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the @.

16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word @ he

he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 16:17 And hath
confirmed the same to @] for a law, and to @ for an
everlasting covenant, 16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of
Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; 16:19 When ye were but few, even
a few, and strangers in it.

16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
to @F @; 16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he
reproved kings for @ sakes, 16:22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed,
and do my prophets no harm.

16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the @; shew @ from day to day
his salvation.

16:24 Declare his @Y @ the heathen; his marvellous works @
all nations.

16:25 For @ is the LORD, and @ly to be praised: he also is to
be feared above all gods.

16:26 For all the gods of the @ are idols: but the LORD made the
@1s.

16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are
in his @'.

16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the @, give unto the
LORD @Y and strength.

16:29 Give unto the LORD the @Y due unto his name: @( an

16:30 Fear @	 him, all the @: the world also @ be stable,
that it be not moved.

16:31 Let the @1s be glad, and let the @ rejoice: and let men
say @ the nations, The LORD reigneth.

16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness @of: let the fields
rejoice, and all that is @in.

16:33 Then @ the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
LORD, @ he cometh to judge the @.

16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
endureth for ever.

16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
@?, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to
thy holy name, and @Y in thy praise.

16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of @ for ever and ever. And all the
@ said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

16:37 So he left @ @	 the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Asaph and his @3, to minister @	 the ark continually, as
@ day's work required: 16:38 And Obededom with @ @3,
@@score and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to

and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for @J that @# make a
sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun
were porters.

16:43 And all the @ departed @ man to his @: and @
returned to bless his @.

17:1 Now it came to pass, as @ sat in his @, that @ said
to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an @ of cedars, but the ark
of the covenant of the LORD remaineth @[ curtains.

17:2 Then Nathan said unto @, Do all that is in @ @; for
God is with thee.

17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
Nathan, @, 17:4 Go and tell @ my @<, Thus @

LORD, Thou @ not build me an @ to dwell in: 17:5 For I have

17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all @, @0 I a word to any

17:9 Also I will ordain a @' for my @ @, and will plant

Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an @.

17:11 And it @ come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou

17:13 I will be his @, and he @ be my son: and I will not

17:15 According to all @ @5, and @$ to all this vision,
so did Nathan @K unto @.

17:16 And @ the king came and sat @	 the LORD, and said, Who

17:18 What can @ @K more to thee for the honour of thy @<?

17:19 O LORD, for thy @<'s sake, and @$ to @ own

17:21 And what one nation in the @ is like thy @ @, whom

17:23 @N now, LORD, let the @7 that thou hast spoken

17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness

18:1 Now @ this it came to pass, that @ smote the Philistines,
and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the
Philistines.

18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became @'s @<s, and
@ gifts.

18:3 And @ smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went
to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

18:4 And @ took from him a @: chariots, and @H @:
horsemen, and twenty @: footmen: @ also houghed all the
chariot horses, but reserved of them an @/ chariots.

18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
Zobah, @ slew of the Syrians two and twenty @: men.

18:6 Then @ put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
@'s @<s, and @ gifts. Thus the LORD preserved @
whithersoever he went.

18:7 And @ took the shields of gold that were on the @<s of
Hadarezer, and @ them to @ .

18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, @G of Hadarezer,
@ @ very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea,
and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath @) how @ had smitten all the
host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king
@, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, @ he
had fought @
 Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and
brass.

18:11 Them also king @ dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
and the gold that he @ from all @ nations; from Edom, and
from Moab, and from the @ of Ammon, and from the Philistines,
and from Amalek.

18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
valley of salt eighteen @:.

18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
@'s @<s. Thus the LORD preserved @ whithersoever he went.

18:14 So @ reigned over all @, and executed judgment and
justice @ all his @.

18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud, recorder.

18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
were the @6s; and Shavsha was scribe; 18:17 And Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of
@ were chief @+ the king.

19:1 Now it came to pass @ this, that Nahash the king of the
@ of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

19:2 And @ said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, @ his @ shewed kindness to me. And @ sent
messengers to comfort him concerning his @. So the @<s of
@ came into the land of the @ of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort
him.

19:3 But the princes of the @ of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
thou that @ doth honour thy @, that he hath sent comforters
unto thee?  are not his @<s come unto thee for to search, and to
overthrow, and to spy out the land?  19:4 Wherefore Hanun took @'s
@<s, and shaved them, and cut off @ garments in the @a
hard by @ buttocks, and sent them away.

19:5 Then @ went certain, and told @ how the men were served.
And he sent to meet them: for the men were @ly ashamed. And the
king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then
return.

19:6 And when the @ of Ammon saw that they had made @T
odious to @, Hanun and the @ of Ammon sent a @:
talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of
Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.

19:7 So they hired thirty and two @: chariots, and the king of
Maachah and his @; who came and pitched @	 Medeba. And the
@ of Ammon ga@d @T @? from @ @G, and
came to battle.

19:8 And when @ @) of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
@By men.

19:9 And the @ of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
@	 the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by
@T in the field.

19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set @
 him @	 and
behind, he chose out of all the choice of @, and put them in
array @
 the Syrians.

19:11 And the rest of the @ he delivered unto the hand of Abishai
his @X, and they set @T in array @
 the @ of
Ammon.

19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
@ help me: but if the @ of Ammon be too strong for thee,
then I will help thee.

19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
our @, and for the @G of our God: and let the LORD do that
@ is good in his sight.

19:14 So Joab and the @ that were with him drew nigh @	 the
Syrians unto the battle; and they fled @	 him.

19:15 And when the @ of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
they likewise fled @	 Abishai his @X, and entered into the
city. Then Joab came to @ .

19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse @	
@, they sent messengers, and drew @ the Syrians that were
beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer
went @	 them.

19:17 And it was told @; and he ga@d all @, and passed
over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array @

them. So when @ had put the battle in array @
 the Syrians,
they fought with him.

19:18 But the Syrians fled @	 @; and @ slew of the
Syrians @H @: men @ fought in chariots, and forty
@: footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

19:19 And when the @<s of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
worse @	 @, they made @U with @, and became his
@<s: @" @L the Syrians help the @ of Ammon any
more.

20:1 And it came to pass, that @ the year was expired, at the time
that kings go out to battle, Joab led @ the power of the army, and
wasted the country of the @ of Ammon, and came and besieged
Rabbah. But @ tarried at @ . And Joab smote Rabbah, and
destroyed it.

20:2 And @ took the crown of @ king from off his head, and
@V it to weigh a talent of gold, and @ were precious stones in
it; and it was set upon @'s head: and he @ also exceeding
much spoil out of the city.

20:3 And he @ out the @ that were in it, and cut them with
saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt @
with all the @G of the @ of Ammon. And @ and all the
@ returned to @ .

20:4 And it came to pass @ this, that @ arose war at Gezer
with the Philistines; at @ time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew
Sippai, that was of the @ of the giant: and they were subdued.

20:5 And @ was war @* with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
of Jair slew Lahmi the @X of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear
staff was like a weaver's beam.

20:6 And yet @* @ was war at Gath, where was a man of @
stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each
hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.

20:7 But when he defied @, Jonathan the son of Shimea @'s
@X slew him.

20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
of @, and by the hand of his @<s.

21:1 And Satan stood up @
 @, and provoked @ to number
@.

21:2 And @ said to Joab and to the rulers of the @, Go,
number @ from Beersheba even to Dan; and @( the number of them

21:3 And Joab @>, The LORD make his @ an @/ times so
many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my
lord's @<s?  why then doth my lord require this @7? why will
he be a cause of trespass to @?  21:4 Nevertheless the king's
word prevailed @
 Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went
@Eout all @, and came to @ .

21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the @ unto @. And
all they of @ were a @: @: and an @/ @:
men that drew @Q: and @ was four @/ @@score and ten
@: men that drew @Q.

21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not @ them: for the king's
word was abominable to Joab.

21:7 And God was displeased with this @7; @fore he smote
@.

21:8 And @ said unto God, I have sinned @ly, @ I have
done this @7: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy
@<; for I have done very foolishly.

21:9 And the LORD @0 unto Gad, @'s seer, @, 21:10 Go and
tell @, @, Thus @
 the LORD, I offer thee @@ @:
choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

21:11 So Gad came to @, and said unto him, Thus @

21:13 And @ said unto Gad, I am in a @ strait: let me fall now

not fall into the hand of man.

21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon @: and @ fell of
@ @Hty @: men.

21:15 And God sent an angel unto @  to destroy it: and as he
was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and
said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now @ hand.
And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.

21:16 And @ lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
stand between the @ and the @1, having a drawn @Q in his

21:17 And @ said unto God, Is it not I that @M the @

but as for @ sheep, what have they done? let @ hand, I pray

21:18 Then the angel of the LORD @M Gad to say to @, that
@ @# go up, and set up an @\ unto the LORD in the
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

21:19 And @ went up at the @ of Gad, @ he @0 in the

21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with

21:21 And as @ came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw @, and went
out of the threshingfloor, and bowed @9 to @ with his face to

21:22 Then @ said to Ornan, Grant me the @' of this
threshingfloor, that I may build an @\ @in unto the LORD: thou
@ grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed
from the @.

21:23 And Ornan said unto @, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
king do that @ is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also
for @_ @&s, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the

21:24 And king @ said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for

21:25 So @ gave to Ornan for the @' six @/ shekels of gold

21:26 And @ built @ an @\ unto the LORD, and offered @_

21:27 And the LORD @M the angel; and he put up his @Q @*

21:28 At that time when @ saw that the LORD had @> him in

21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, @ @ made in the

in the high @' at Gibeon.

21:30 But @ could not go @	 it to enquire of God: for he was
afraid @ of the @Q of the angel of the LORD.

22:1 Then @ said, This is the @ of the LORD God, and this is
the @\ of the @_ @& for @.

22:2 And @ @M to gather @? the strangers that were in
the land of @; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build
the @ of God.

22:3 And @ prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors

weight; 22:4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they
of Tyre @ much cedar wood to @.

22:5 And @ said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the @
that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of
fame and of @Y @Eout all countries: I will @fore now make

22:6 Then he @, for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an

22:7 And @ said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind
to build an @ unto the name of the LORD my God: 22:8 But the word
of the LORD came to me, @, Thou hast shed @I abundantly, and
hast made @ wars: thou @ not build an @ unto my name,
@ thou hast shed much @I upon the @ in my sight.

22:9 @., a son @ be born to thee, who @ be a man of rest;

22:10 He @ build an @ for my name; and he @ be my son, and
I will be his @; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
over @ for ever.

22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build
the @ of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and @[standing, and give thee
charge concerning @, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD
thy God.

22:13 Then @ thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
statutes and judgments @ the LORD charged @ with concerning
@: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

22:14 Now, @%, in my trouble I have prepared for the @ of the

talents of silver; and of brass and iron @S weight; for it is in

22:15 Moreover @ are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and

manner of work.

22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, @ is
no number. Arise @fore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.

22:17 @ also @M all the princes of @ to help Solomon
his son, @, 22:18 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he
not @= you rest on @ side? for he hath @= the inhabitants of
the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued @	 the LORD, and
@	 his @.

22:19 Now set your @ and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
arise @fore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to @(
the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into
the @ that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

23:1 So when @ was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son
king over @.

23:2 And he ga@d @? all the princes of @, with the
@6s and the Levites.

23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty @8 and
upward: and @ number by @ polls, man by man, was thirty and
eight @:.

23:4 Of @, twenty and four @: were to set forward the work
of the @ of the LORD; and six @: were officers and judges:
23:5 Moreover four @: were porters; and four @: praised
the LORD with the instruments @ I made, said @, to praise
@with.

23:6 And @ divided them into courses @ the sons of Levi,
namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

23:7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

23:8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
@@.

23:9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, @@.
These were the chief of the @s of Laadan.

23:10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
Beriah.

These four were the sons of Shimei.

23:11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
Beriah had not many sons; @fore they were in one reckoning,
@$ to @ @'s @.

23:12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

23:13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and @: and Aaron was separated,
that he @# sanctify the most holy @, he and his sons for
ever, to burn incense @	 the LORD, to minister unto him, and to
bless in his name for ever.

23:14 Now concerning @ the man of God, his sons were named of the
tribe of Levi.

23:15 The sons of @ were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

23:16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
had none @C sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

23:18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

23:19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the @O, Amariah the second,
Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

23:20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the @O and Jesiah the second.

23:21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
Eleazar, and Kish.

23:22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and @
@3 the sons of Kish took them.

23:23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, @@.

23:24 These were the sons of Levi @ the @ of @ @s;
even the chief of the @s, as they were counted by number of names
by @ polls, that did the work for the service of the @ of the
LORD, from the age of twenty @8 and upward.

23:25 For @ said, The LORD God of @ hath @= rest unto his
@, that they may dwell in @  for ever: 23:26 And also unto
the Levites; they @ no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels
of it for the service @of.

23:27 For by the last @5 of @ the Levites were numbered from
twenty @8 old and above: 23:28 Because @ office was to wait on
the sons of Aaron for the service of the @ of the LORD, in the
courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy @,
and the work of the service of the @ of God; 23:29 Both for the
shew@d, and for the fine flour for meat @&, and for the
unleavened cakes, and for that @ is baked in the pan, and for that

the @`, and the charge of the holy @', and the charge of
the sons of Aaron @ @3, in the service of the @ of the
LORD.

24:1 Now @ are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died @	 @ @, and had no

24:3 And @ distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, @$ to @ offices in
@ service.

24:4 And @ were more chief men @V of the sons of Eleazar than

Eleazar @ were sixteen chief men of the @ of @ @s,
and eight @ the sons of Ithamar @$ to the @ of @
@s.

24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with @F; for the
governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the @ of God, were of
the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,
wrote them @	 the king, and the princes, and Zadok the @6, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and @	 the chief of the @s of
the @6s and Levites: one principal @hold being taken for
Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

24:7 Now the @O lot came @ to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
24:8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 24:9 The fifth to
Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 24:10 The @Hth to Hakkoz, the

24:25 The @X of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
Zechariah.

24:26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
Beno.

24:27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and
Ibri.

24:28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

24:29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

24:30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
were the sons of the Levites @ the @ of @ @s.

24:31 These likewise cast lots over @

Aaron in the presence of @ the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and
the chief of the @s of the @6s and Levites, even the

25:1 Moreover @ and the captains of the host separated to the
service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who
@# prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the

and with all the valiant men, unto @ .

28:2 Then @ the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
@3, and my @: As for me, I had in mine @ to build an

footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 28:3 But
God said unto me, Thou @ not build an @ for my name, @
thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed @I.

28:4 Howbeit the LORD God of @ chose me @	 all the @ of

28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he @ build my @ and

28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant

28:8 Now @fore in the sight of all @ the @` of the

28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy @, and

forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.

28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an @
for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

28:11 Then @ gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and
of the @s @of, and of the treasuries @of, and of the upper

28:14 He gave of gold by weight for @ of gold, for all

28:16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shew@d, for

28:19 All this, said @, the LORD made me @[stand in writing by
his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

28:20 And @ said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good

my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,

28:21 And, @%, the courses of the @6s and the Levites, even

29:1 Furthermore @ the king said unto all the @`,
Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender,

29:2 Now I have prepared with all my @B for the @ of my God the

glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious

29:3 Moreover, @ I have set my affection to the @ of my God,

of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this
day unto the LORD?  29:6 Then the chief of the @s and princes of
the tribes of @ and the captains of @:s and of @/s,
with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, 29:7 And gave
for the service of the @ of God of gold five @: talents and
ten @: drams, and of silver ten @: talents, and of brass
eighteen @: talents, and one @/ @: talents of iron.

29:8 And they with whom precious stones were @V gave them to the

29:9 Then the @ rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,

29:10 Wherefore @ blessed the LORD @	 all the @`:

29:20 And @ said to all the @`, Now bless the LORD your

And all the @` blessed the LORD God of @ @s, and

29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered @_

29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of

29:24 And all the princes, and the @By men, and all the sons

29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all

The Second Book of the Chronicles


1:1 And Solomon the son of @ was strengthened in his kingdom, and
the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.

1:2 Then Solomon @0 unto all @, to the captains of @:s

@, the chief of the @s.

1:3 So Solomon, and all the @` with him, went to the high

1:4 But the ark of God had @ @ up from Kirjathjearim to the

1:5 Moreover the brasen @\, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son

Solomon and the @` sought unto it.

1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen @\ @	 the LORD,

1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask

1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed @ mercy unto @

1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto @ my @ be

1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in

1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high @' that was at

1:14 And Solomon ga@d chariots and horsemen: and he had a @:

1:15 And the king made silver and gold at @  as plenteous as

1:16 And Solomon had horses @ out of @-, and linen yarn: the

1:17 And they fetched up, and @ @ out of @- a chariot for
six @/ shekels of silver, and an horse for an @/ and fifty:
and so @ they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and

2:1 And Solomon determined to build an @ for the name of the LORD,

2:2 And Solomon told out @@score and ten @: men to bear

2:3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, @, As thou didst

2:4 @., I build an @ to the name of the LORD my God, to

2:5 And the @ @ I build is @: for @ is our God above

2:6 But who is able to build him an @, seeing the @1 and

build him an @, save only to burn sacrifice @	 him?  2:7 Send

2:8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of

2:11 Then Huram the king of Tyre @> in writing, @ he sent to

2:12 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of @, that made

2:13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with @[standing, of

2:15 Now @fore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,

3:2 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in

3:3 Now @ are the @ wherein Solomon was instructed for the

3:7 He overlaid also the @, the beams, the posts, and the walls

3:10 And in the most holy @ he made two cherubims of image work,
and overlaid them with gold.

3:11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing
of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the @:
and the @C wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of
the @C cherub.

3:12 And one wing of the @C cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
wall of the @: and the @C wing was five cubits also, joining to
the wing of the @C cherub.

3:13 The wings of @ cherubims spread @T @ twenty
cubits: and they stood on @ feet, and @ faces were inward.

3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
linen, and wrought cherubims @on.

3:15 Also he made @	 the @ two pillars of thirty and five
cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was
five cubits.

3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads
of the pillars; and made an @/ pomegranates, and put them on the
chains.

3:17 And he reared up the pillars @	 the temple, one on the @c
hand, and the @C on the left; and @, the name of that on the
@c hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

4:1 Moreover he made an @\ of brass, twenty cubits the length
@of, and twenty cubits the @dth @of, and ten cubits the
height @of.

4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
in compass, and five cubits the height @of; and a line of thirty
cubits did compass it round @+.

4:3 And @[ it was the similitude of oxen, @ did compass it
round @+: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round @+. Two rows
of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, @@ looking toward the north, and
@@ looking toward the west, and @@ looking toward the south, and
@@ looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,
and all @ hinder parts were inward.

4:5 And the thickness of it was an hand@dth, and the brim of it
like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it
received and held @@ @: baths.

4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the @c hand, and five
on the left, to wash in them: such @ as they offered for the
@_ @& they washed in them; but the sea was for the @6s to
wash in.

4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold @$ to @ form, and
set them in the temple, five on the @c hand, and five on the left.

4:8 He made also ten tables, and @'d them in the temple, five on
the @c side, and five on the left. And he made an @/ basons of
gold.

4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the @6s, and the @ court,
and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

4:10 And he set the sea on the @c side of the east end, over
@
 the south.

4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the
@ of God; 4:12 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the
chapiters @ were on the top of the two pillars, and the two
wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters @ were on the
top of the pillars; 4:13 And four @/ pomegranates on the two
wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two
pommels of the chapiters @ were upon the pillars.

4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One
sea, and twelve oxen @[ it.

4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the @Rhooks, and all @
instruments, did Huram his @ make to king Solomon for the @
of the LORD of b@c brass.

4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zeredathah.

4:18 Thus Solomon made all @ vessels in @ abundance: for the
weight of the brass could not be @V out.

4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the @ of God,
the golden @\ also, and the tables whereon the shew@d was set;
4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with @ lamps, that they @# burn
@ the manner @	 the oracle, of pure gold; 4:21 And the
flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that
perfect gold; 4:22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons,
and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the @, the inner
doors @of for the most holy @', and the doors of the @ of
the temple, were of gold.

5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the @ of the LORD was
finished: and Solomon @ in all the @ that @ his @
had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments,
put he @ the treasures of the @ of God.

5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of @, and all the heads of
the tribes, the chief of the @s of the @ of @, unto
@ , to @( up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the
city of @, @ is Zion.

5:3 Wherefore all the men of @ assembled @T unto the king

5:4 And all the elders of @ came; and the Levites took up the
ark.

5:5 And they @ up the ark, and the tabernacle of the

@ did the @6s and the Levites @( up.

5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the @` of @ that were
assembled unto him @	 the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, @
could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

5:7 And the @6s @ in the ark of the covenant of the LORD

even @[ the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread
@ @ wings over the @' of the ark, and the cherubims covered
the ark and the staves @of above.

5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark @	 the oracle; but they were not
seen @S. And @ it is unto this day.

5:10 There was no@7 in the ark save the two tables @ @ put
@in at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the @ of
@, when they came out of @-.

5:11 And it came to pass, when the @6s were come out of the holy
@': (for all the @6s that were present were sanctified, and did
not then wait by course: 5:12 Also the Levites @ were the singers,
all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with @ sons and @
@3, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
and harps, stood at the east end of the @\, and with them an
@/ and twenty @6s sounding with trumpets:) 5:13 It came even
to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound
to be @) in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up
@ @; with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick,
and praised the LORD, @, For he is good; for his mercy endureth
for ever: that then the @ was filled with a cloud, even the @
of the LORD; 5:14 So that the @6s could not stand to minister by
reason of the cloud: for the @Y of the LORD had filled the @ of
God.

6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he @L dwell in the
thick darkness.

6:2 But I have built an @ of habitation for thee, and a @' for
thy dwelling for ever.

6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole @`
of @: and all the @` of @ stood.

6:4 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of @, who hath with his
@D fulfilled that @ he @0 with his @P to my @ @,
@, 6:5 Since the day that I @ @ my @ out of the

that my name @B be @; and have chosen @ to be over my

6:7 Now it was in the @ of @ my @ to build an @ for
the name of the LORD God of @.

6:8 But the LORD said to @ my @, Forasmuch as it was in @
@ to build an @ for my name, thou didst well in that it was in

6:10 The LORD @fore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:
for I am risen up in the room of @ my @, and am set on the

the name of the LORD God of @.

6:11 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
LORD, that he made with the @ of @.

6:12 And he stood @	 the @\ of the LORD in the presence of all
the @` of @, and spread @ his @D: 6:13 For
Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five

the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees
@	 all the @` of @, and spread @ his @D

6:14 And said, O LORD God of @, @ is no God like thee in the

Thou @ hast kept with thy @< @ my @ that @ thou

6:16 Now @fore, O LORD God of @, keep with thy @< @

6:17 Now then, O LORD God of @, let thy word be verified, @
thou hast spoken unto thy @< @.

6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the @? @%,
@1 and the @1 of @1s cannot contain thee; how much less

6:21 Hearken @fore unto the supplications of thy @<, and of

forgive.

6:22 If a man sin @

6:23 Then hear thou from @1, and do, and judge thy @<s, by
requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and

6:24 And if thy @ @ be put to the worse @	 the enemy,
@ they have sinned @

6:25 Then hear thou from the @1s, and forgive the sin of thy

6:26 When the @1 is shut up, and @ is no rain, @ they
have sinned @

confess thy name, and turn from @ sin, when thou dost afflict

thou hast @= unto thy @ for an inheritance.

6:28 If @ be d@ in the land, if @ be pestilence, if @

besiege them in the @G of @ land; whatsoever sore or

thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land @ thou
gavest unto our @s.

6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, @ is not of thy @
@, but is come from a far country for thy @ name's sake, and
thy @By hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in

6:34 If thy @ go out to war @

Then hear thou from the @1s @ prayer and @ supplication,

6:36 If they sin @
 thee, (for @ is no man @ sinneth

carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of @
captivity, @, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt
wickedly; 6:38 If they return to thee with all @ @ and with

6:40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, @ eyes be open, and let
@ ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this @'.

6:41 Now @fore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting @', thou,

with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.

6:42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of @ anointed: remember
the mercies of @ thy @<.

7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
from @1, and consumed the @_ @& and the sacrifices; and
the @Y of the LORD filled the @.

7:2 And the @6s could not enter into the @ of the LORD,
@ the @Y of the LORD had filled the LORD's @.

7:3 And when all the @ of @ saw how the fire came down,
and the @Y of the LORD upon the @, they bowed @T with
@ faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and
praised the LORD, @, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
ever.

7:4 Then the king and all the @ offered sacrifices @	 the
LORD.

7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two @:
oxen, and an @/ and twenty @: sheep: so the king and all
the @ dedicated the @ of God.

7:6 And the @6s waited on @ offices: the Levites also with
instruments of musick of the LORD, @ @ the king had made to
praise the LORD, @ his mercy endureth for ever, when @
praised by @ ministry; and the @6s sounded trumpets @	
them, and all @ stood.

7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was @	
the @ of the LORD: for @ he offered @_ @&s, and the
fat of the @U @&s, @ the brasen @\ @ Solomon had
made was not able to receive the @_ @&s, and the meat
@&s, and the fat.

7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast @H days, and all
@ with him, a very @ @`, from the entering in of
Hamath unto the river of @-.

7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
the dedication of the @\ @H days, and the feast @H days.

7:10 And on the @@ and twentieth day of the @Hth month he sent
the @ away into @ tents, glad and merry in @ for the
goodness that the LORD had shewed unto @, and to Solomon, and to
@ his @.

7:11 Thus Solomon finished the @ of the LORD, and the king's
@: and all that came into Solomon's @ to make in the @ of
the LORD, and in his own @, he prosperously effected.

7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
have @) thy prayer, and have chosen this @' to myself for an
@ of sacrifice.

7:13 If I shut up @1 that @ be no rain, or if I command the
locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence @ my @;
7:14 If my @, @ are @, by my name, @ humble
@T, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from @ wicked
ways; then will I hear from @1, and will forgive @ sin, and
will heal @ land.

7:15 Now mine eyes @ be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
that is made in this @'.

7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this @, that my name may
be @ for ever: and mine eyes and mine @ @ be @
perpetually.

7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk @	 me, as @ thy @
walked, and do @$ to all that I have @M thee, and @
observe my statutes and my judgments; 7:18 Then will I stablish the
throne of thy kingdom, @$ as I have covenanted with @ thy
@, @, There @ not fail thee a man to be ruler in @.

7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
@ I have set @	 you, and @ go and serve @C gods, and
worship them; 7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my
land @ I have @= them; and this @, @ I have sanctified
for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
proverb and a byword @ all nations.

7:21 And this @, @ is high, @ be an astonishment to @
one that passeth by it; so that he @ say, Why hath the LORD done
thus unto this land, and unto this @?  7:22 And it @ be
@>, Because they forsook the LORD God of @ @s, @
@ them @ out of the land of @-, and laid hold on @C
gods, and worshipped them, and served them: @fore hath he @
all this evil upon them.

8:1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty @8, wherein Solomon
had built the @ of the LORD, and his own @, 8:2 That the
@G @ Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and
caused the @ of @ to dwell @.

8:3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed @
 it.

8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store @G,
@ he built in Hamath.

8:5 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
fenced @G, with walls, gates, and bars; 8:6 And Baalath, and all
the store @G that Solomon had, and all the chariot @G, and the
@G of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in
@ , and in Lebanon, and @Eout all the land of his
dominion.

8:7 As for all the @ that were left of the Hittites, and the
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
@ were not of @, 8:8 But of @ @, who were left
@ them in the land, whom the @ of @ consumed not, them
did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.

8:9 But of the @ of @ did Solomon make no @<s for his
work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and
captains of his chariots and horsemen.

8:10 And @ were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
@/ and fifty, that bare rule over the @.

8:11 And Solomon @ up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
@ unto the @ that he had built for her: for he said, My wife
@ not dwell in the @ of @ king of @, @ the
@'s are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.

8:12 Then Solomon offered @_ @&s unto the LORD on the @\

certain rate @ day, @& @$ to the commandment of
@, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn

@d, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.

8:14 And he appointed, @$ to the order of @ his @, the
courses of the @6s to @ service, and the Levites to @
charges, to praise and minister @	 the @6s, as the duty of
@ day required: the porters also by @ courses at @ gate:
for so had @ the man of God @M.

8:15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
@6s and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the
treasures.

8:16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
@Vation of the @ of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the
@ of the LORD was perfected.

8:17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in
the land of Edom.

8:18 And Huram sent him by the @D of his @<s ships, and
@<s that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
@<s of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four @/ and fifty
talents of gold, and @ them to king Solomon.

9:1 And when the queen of Sheba @) of the fame of Solomon, she came
to prove Solomon with hard questions at @ , with a very @
company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and
precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with
him of all that was in her @.

9:2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and @ was no@7 hid

9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and

@ apparel; his cupbearers also, and @ apparel; and his ascent

9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report @ I @) in
mine own land of @ acts, and of thy wisdom: 9:6 Howbeit I believed
not @ @5, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, @%,

9:7 Happy are thy men, and happy are @ thy @<s, @ stand

9:8 Blessed be the LORD thy God, @ delighted in thee to set thee

9:9 And she gave the king an @/ and twenty talents of gold, and

such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.

9:10 And the @<s also of Huram, and the @<s of Solomon,
@ @ gold from Ophir, @ algum trees and precious

9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the @ of the

and @ were none such seen @	 in the land of @.

9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that @ she had @ unto the king.
So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her @<s.

9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
@/ and @@score and six talents of gold; 9:14 Beside that @
chapmen and merchants @. And all the kings of Arabia and
governors of the country @ gold and silver to Solomon.

9:15 And king Solomon made two @/ targets of beaten gold: six

9:16 And @@ @/ shields made he of beaten gold: @@ @/
shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the @

9:17 Moreover the king made a @ throne of ivory, and overlaid it

9:18 And @ were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,

There was not the like made in any kingdom.

12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,

12:2 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam

12:5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of

12:8 Nevertheless they @ be his @<s; that they may know my

12:9 So Shishak king of @- came up @

12:10 Instead of @ king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and

12:12 And when he humbled @9, the wrath of the LORD turned from

12:13 So king Rehoboam strengthened @9 in @ , and reigned:

12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, @O and last, are they not written

12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his @s, and was buried in the city

13:4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, @ is in mount

13:8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand

13:9 Have ye not cast out the @6s of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,

13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken

13:13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come @+ behind them: so

13:14 And when @ looked back, @%, the battle was @	 and

13:15 Then the men of @ gave a shout: and as the men of @

13:16 And the @ of @ fled @	 @: and God delivered

13:20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength @* in the days of

13:21 But Abijah waxed @By, and married fourteen wives, and begat

13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his

14:1 So Abijah slept with his @s, and they buried him in the city

14:2 And Asa did that @ was good and @c in the eyes of the LORD

14:5 Also he took away out of all the @G of @ the high @'s

14:6 And he built fenced @G in @: for the land had rest, and

14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
no@7 with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have

14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians @	 Asa, and @	 @;
and the Ethiopians fled.

14:13 And Asa and the @ that were with him pursued them unto
Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover

14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and

15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And
he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all

15:3 Now for a long season @ hath been @S the true God, and

15:7 Be ye strong @fore, and let not your @D be weak: for your

15:8 And when Asa @) @ @5, and the prophecy of Oded the

15:9 And he ga@d all @ and Benjamin, and the strangers with

16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of

16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha @) it, that he left off

16:6 Then Asa the king took all @; and they carried away the

building; and he built @with Geba and Mizpah.

16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of @, and

17:16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
offered @9 unto the LORD; and with him two @/ @:
@By men of valour.

17:17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a @By man of valour, and with him
armed men with bow and shield two @/ @:.

17:18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an @/ and
fourscore @: ready prepared for the war.

17:19 These waited on the king, beside @J whom the king put in the
fenced @G @Eout all @.

18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
affinity with Ahab.

18:2 And @ certain @8 he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the @ that he
had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.

18:3 And Ahab king of @ said unto Jehoshaphat king of @, Wilt
thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he @> him, I am as thou
art, and my @ as thy @; and we will be with thee in the war.

18:4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of @, Enquire, I pray
thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

18:5 @N the king of @ ga@d @? of prophets four
@/ men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to
battle, or @ I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver
it into the king's hand.

18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is @ not here a prophet of the LORD
besides, that we @B enquire of him?  18:7 And the king of @
said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of
the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but
always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat
said, Let not the king say so.

18:8 And the king of @ @, for one of his officers, and said,
Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

18:9 And the king of @ and Jehoshaphat king of @ sat either
of them on his throne, clothed in @ robes, and they sat in a void
@' at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
prophesied @	 them.

18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
and said, Thus @
 the LORD, With @ thou @ push Syria until
they be consumed.

18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, @, Go up to
Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD @ deliver it into the hand
of the king.

18:12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah @0 to him,
@, @., the @5 of the prophets declare good to the king
with one assent; let thy word @fore, I pray thee, be like one of
@'s, and @K thou good.

18:13 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God @
,
that will I @K.

18:14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
Micaiah, @ we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or @ I forbear?
And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they @ be delivered into
your hand.

18:15 And the king said to him, How many times @ I adjure thee
that thou say no@7 but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
18:16 Then he said, I did see all @ scattered upon the mountains,
as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no
master; let them return @fore @ man to his @ in @U.

18:17 And the king of @ said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
that he @L not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  18:18 Again he
said, @N hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon
his throne, and all the host of @1 standing on his @c hand and
on his left.

18:19 And the LORD said, Who @ entice Ahab king of @, that he
may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one @0 @ @ this
manner, and @F @ @ that manner.

18:20 Then @ came out a spirit, and stood @	 the LORD, and
said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  18:21
And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the @P of all
his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou @ entice him, and thou @
also prevail: go out, and do even so.

18:22 Now @fore, @%, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
@P of @ thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil @

thee.

18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah
upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from
me to @K unto thee?  18:24 And Micaiah said, @., thou @ see
on that day when thou @ go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

18:25 Then the king of @ said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
18:26 And say, Thus @
 the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
feed him with @d of affliction and with @Z of affliction, until
I return in @U.

18:27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in @U, then hath
not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye @.

18:28 So the king of @ and Jehoshaphat the king of @ went up
to Ramothgilead.

18:29 And the king of @ said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the
king of @ disguised @9; and they went to the battle.

18:30 Now the king of Syria had @M the captains of the chariots
that were with him, @, Fight ye not with small or @, save
only with the king of @.

18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of @. @N they
compassed @+ him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD
helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.

18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
perceived that it was not the king of @, they turned back @*
from pursuing him.

18:33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
@ between the joints of the harness: @fore he said to his
chariot man, Turn @ hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the
host; for I am wounded.

18:34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of @
stayed @9 up in his chariot @
 the Syrians until the even:
and @+ the time of the sun going down he died.

19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of @ returned to his @ in @U
to @ .

19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love
them that hate the LORD? @fore is wrath upon thee from @	 the
LORD.

19:3 Nevertheless @ are good @ @V in thee, in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared @
@ to seek God.

19:4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at @ : and he went out @* @E
the @ from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and @ them back unto
the LORD God of @ @s.

19:5 And he set judges in the land @Eout all the fenced @G of
@, city by city, 19:6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye
do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the
judgment.

19:7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and
do it: for @ is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of
persons, nor taking of gifts.

19:8 Moreover in @  did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of
the @6s, and of the chief of the @s of @, for the
judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to
@ .

19:9 And he charged them, @, Thus @ ye do in the fear of the
LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect @.

19:10 And what cause soever @ come to you of your @3 that
dwell in your @G, between @I and @I, between law and
commandment, statutes and judgments, ye @ even warn them that they
trespass not @
 the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon
your @3: this do, and ye @ not trespass.

19:11 And, @%, Amariah the chief @6 is over you in all matters
of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the @
of @, for all the king's matters: also the Levites @ be
officers @	 you. Deal courageously, and the LORD @ be with the
good.

20:1 It came to pass @ this also, that the @ of Moab, and
the @ of Ammon, and with them @C beside the Ammonites, came
@
 Jehoshaphat to battle.

20:2 Then @ came some that told Jehoshaphat, @, There cometh
a @ multitude @
 thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;
and, @%, they be in Hazazontamar, @ is Engedi.

20:3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set @9 to seek the LORD, and
proclaimed a fast @Eout all @.

20:4 And @ ga@d @T @?, to ask help of the LORD:
even out of all the @G of @ they came to seek the LORD.

20:5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the @` of @ and @ ,
in the @ of the LORD, @	 the new court, 20:6 And said, O LORD
God of our @s, art not thou God in @1? and rulest not thou
over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in @ hand is @ not
power and @B, so that none is able to withstand thee?  20:7 Art not
thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land @	
thy @ @, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for
ever?  20:8 And they dwelt @in, and have built thee a sanctuary
@in for thy name, @, 20:9 If, when evil cometh upon us, as
the @Q, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand @	 this
@, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this @,) and cry
unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

20:10 And now, @%, the @ of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,
whom thou @Lest not let @ invade, when they came out of the
land of @-, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
20:11 @., I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
possession, @ thou hast @= us to inherit.

20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no @B
@
 this @ company that cometh @
 us; @" know we
what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

20:13 And all @ stood @	 the LORD, with @ little ones,
@ wives, and @ @.

20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the
son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,
came the Spirit of the LORD in the @a of the @`; 20:15
And he said, Hearken ye, all @, and ye inhabitants of @ ,
and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus @
 the LORD unto you, Be not afraid
nor dismayed by reason of this @ multitude; for the battle is not
yours, but God's.

20:16 To morrow go ye down @
 them: @%, they come up by the
cliff of Ziz; and ye @ find them at the end of the brook, @	
the wilderness of Jeruel.

20:17 Ye @ not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand
ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O @ and
@ : fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out @
 them:
for the LORD will be with you.

20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and
all @ and the inhabitants of @  fell @	 the LORD,
worshipping the LORD.

20:19 And the Levites, of the @ of the Kohathites, and of the
@ of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of @
with a loud @; on high.

20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went @ into the
wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went @, Jehoshaphat stood and
said, Hear me, O @, and ye inhabitants of @ ; Believe in
the LORD your God, so @ ye be established; believe his prophets,
so @ ye prosper.

20:21 And when he had consulted with the @, he appointed singers
unto the LORD, and that @# praise the beauty of holiness, as they
went out @	 the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy
endureth for ever.

20:22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
ambushments @
 the @ of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, @
were come @
 @; and they were smitten.

20:23 For the @ of Ammon and Moab stood up @
 the
inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when
they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, @ one helped to
destroy @F.

20:24 And when @ came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
they looked unto the multitude, and, @%, they were dead bodies
fallen to the @, and none escaped.

20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his @ came to take away the spoil
of them, they @V @ them in abundance both riches with the dead
bodies, and precious jewels, @ they stripped off for @T,
more than they could carry away: and they were @@ days in gathering
of the spoil, it was so much.

20:26 And on the fourth day they assembled @T in the valley of
Berachah; for @ they blessed the LORD: @fore the name of the
same @' was @,, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

20:27 Then they returned, @ man of @ and @ , and
Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go @* to @  with
joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over @ enemies.

20:28 And they came to @  with psalteries and harps and
trumpets unto the @ of the LORD.

20:29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of @J countries,
when they had @) that the LORD fought @
 the enemies of
@.

20:30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
round @+.

20:31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over @: he was thirty and five @8
old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five @8 in
@ .

And his m@C's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

20:32 And he walked in the way of Asa his @, and departed not
from it, doing that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD.

20:33 Howbeit the high @'s were not taken away: for as yet the
@ had not prepared @ @s unto the God of @ @s.

20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, @O and last, @%,
they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is
mentioned in the book of the kings of @.

20:35 And @ this did Jehoshaphat king of @ join @9 with
Ahaziah king of @, who did very wickedly: 20:36 And he joined
@9 with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the
ships in Eziongaber.

20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied @

Jehoshaphat, @, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they
were not able to go to Tarshish.

21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his @s, and was buried with his
@s in the city of @. And Jehoram his son reigned in his
stead.

21:2 And he had @3 the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all @
were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of @.

21:3 And @ @ gave them @ gifts of silver, and of gold,
and of precious @, with fenced @G in @: but the kingdom
gave he to Jehoram; @ he was the @Oborn.

21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his @, he
strengthened @9, and slew all his @3 with the @Q, and
divers also of the princes of @.

21:5 Jehoram was thirty and two @8 old when he began to reign, and
he reigned eight @8 in @ .

21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of @, like as did the
@ of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought
that @ was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

21:7 Howbeit the LORD @L not destroy the @ of @, @ of
the covenant that he had made with @, and as he promised to give a
light to him and to his sons for ever.

21:8 In his days the Edomites revolted from @[ the dominion of
@, and made @T a king.

21:9 Then Jehoram went @ with his princes, and all his chariots
with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites @
compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

21:10 So the Edomites revolted from @[ the hand of @ unto this
day.

The same time also did Libnah revolt from @[ his hand; @ he
had forsaken the LORD God of his @s.

21:11 Moreover he made high @'s in the mountains of @ and
caused the inhabitants of @  to commit fornication, and
compelled @ @to.

21:12 And @ came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, @,
Thus @
 the LORD God of @ thy @, Because thou hast not
walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy @, nor in the ways of Asa
king of @, 21:13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of
@, and hast made @ and the inhabitants of @  to go a
whoring, like to the whoredoms of the @ of Ahab, and also hast
slain thy @3 of thy @'s @, @ were better than
thyself: 21:14 @., with a @ plague will the LORD smite thy
@, and thy @, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 21:15 And
thou @ have @ sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.

21:16 Moreover the LORD stirred up @
 Jehoram the spirit of the
Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 21:17
And they came up into @, and brake into it, and carried away all
the substance that was @V in the king's @, and his sons also,
and his wives; so that @ was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz,
the youngest of his sons.

21:18 And @ all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
incurable disease.

21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, @ the end of
two @8, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died
of sore diseases. And his @ made no burning for him, like the
burning of his @s.

21:20 Thirty and two @8 old was he when he began to reign, and he
reigned in @  eight @8, and departed @S being desired.
Howbeit they buried him in the city of @, but not in the
sepulchres of the kings.

22:1 And the inhabitants of @  made Ahaziah his youngest son
king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to
the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
of @ reigned.

22:2 Forty and two @8 old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and
he reigned one year in @ . His m@C's name also was Athaliah
the daughter of Omri.

22:3 He also walked in the ways of the @ of Ahab: for his m@C
was his counsellor to do wickedly.

22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the @ of
Ahab: for they were his counsellors @ the @^ of his @ to
his destruction.

22:5 He walked also @ @ counsel, and went with Jehoram the son
of Ahab king of @ to war @
 Hazael king of Syria at
Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

22:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel @ of the wounds
@ were @= him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of @ went down to see
Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, @ he was sick.

22:7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
when he was come, he went out with Jehoram @
 Jehu the son of
Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the @ of Ahab.

22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon
the @ of Ahab, and @V the princes of @, and the sons of the
@3 of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.

22:9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
Samaria,) and @ him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they
buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who
sought the LORD with all his @. So the @ of Ahaziah had no
power to keep still the kingdom.

22:10 But when Athaliah the m@C of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the @ of
@.

22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
of Ahaziah, and stole him from @ the king's sons that were slain,
and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the
daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the @6, (for she
was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew
him not.

22:12 And he was with them hid in the @ of God six @8: and
Athaliah reigned over the land.

23:1 And in the @Hth year Jehoiada strengthened @9, and took
the captains of @/s, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the
son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of
Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

23:2 And they went @+ in @, and ga@d the Levites out of all
the @G of @, and the chief of the @s of @, and they
came to @ .

23:3 And all the @` made a covenant with the king in the
@ of God. And he said unto them, @., the king's son @
reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of @.

23:4 This is the @7 that ye @ do; A third part of you entering
on the sabbath, of the @6s and of the Levites, @ be porters of
the doors; 23:5 And a third part @ be at the king's @; and a
third part at the gate of the @Vation: and all the @ @ be
in the courts of the @ of the LORD.

23:6 But let none come into the @ of the LORD, save the @6s,
and they that minister of the Levites; they @ go in, for they are
holy: but all the @ @ keep the watch of the LORD.

23:7 And the Levites @ compass the king round @+, @ man
with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the
@, he @ be put to @^: but be ye with the king when he
cometh in, and when he goeth out.

23:8 So the Levites and all @ did @$ to all @ that
Jehoiada the @6 had @M, and took @ man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the
sabbath: for Jehoiada the @6 dismissed not the courses.

23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the @6 delivered to the captains of
@/s spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
@'s, @ were in the @ of God.

23:10 And he set all the @, @ man having his weapon in his
hand, from the @c side of the temple to the left side of the
temple, along by the @\ and the temple, by the king round @+.

23:11 Then they @ out the king's son, and put upon him the
crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and
his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

23:12 Now when Athaliah @) the noise of the @ running and
praising the king, she came to the @ into the @ of the LORD:
23:13 And she looked, and, @%, the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the
@ of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the
singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.
Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.

23:14 Then Jehoiada the @6 @ out the captains of @/s
that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her @ of the
ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the @Q. For
the @6 said, Slay her not in the @ of the LORD.

23:15 So they laid @D on her; and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the king's @, they slew her @.

23:16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
@, and between the king, that they @# be the LORD's @.

23:17 Then all the @ went to the @ of Baal, and brake it
down, and brake his @\s and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan
the @6 of Baal @	 the @\s.

23:18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the @ of the LORD by
the hand of the @6s the Levites, whom @ had distributed in the
@ of the LORD, to offer the @_ @&s of the LORD, as it is
written in the law of @, with rejoicing and with singing, as it
was ordained by @.

23:19 And he set the porters at the gates of the @ of the LORD,
that none @ was unclean in any @7 @# enter in.

23:20 And he took the captains of @/s, and the nobles, and the
governors of the @, and all the @ of the land, and @
down the king from the @ of the LORD: and they came @E the
high gate into the king's @, and set the king upon the throne of
the kingdom.

23:21 And all the @ of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
@ that they had slain Athaliah with the @Q.

24:1 Joash was @H @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
forty @8 in @ . His m@C's name also was Zibiah of
Beersheba.

24:2 And Joash did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD all
the days of Jehoiada the @6.

24:3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
daughters.

24:4 And it came to pass @ this, that Joash was minded to repair
the @ of the LORD.

24:5 And he ga@d @? the @6s and the Levites, and said to
them, Go out unto the @G of @, and gather of all @ money
to repair the @ of your God from year to year, and see that ye
hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.

24:6 And the king @, for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
Why hast thou not required of the Levites to @( in out of @ and
out of @  the collection, @$ to the commandment of @
the @< of the LORD, and of the @` of @, for the
tabernacle of witness?  24:7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked
woman, had broken up the @ of God; and also all the dedicated
@ of the @ of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

24:8 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
@S at the gate of the @ of the LORD.

24:9 And they made a proclamation @E @ and @ , to
@( in to the LORD the collection that @ the @< of God laid
upon @ in the wilderness.

24:10 And all the princes and all the @ rejoiced, and @ in,
and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was @
unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw
that @ was much money, the king's scribe and the high @6's
officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his
@' @*. Thus they did day by day, and ga@d money in
abundance.

24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the @ of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the @ of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass
to mend the @ of the LORD.

24:13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and
they set the @ of God in his state, and strengthened it.

24:14 And when they had finished it, they @ the rest of the
money @	 the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the
@ of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and
spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered @_
@&s in the @ of the LORD continually all the days of
Jehoiada.

24:15 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
@/ and thirty @8 old was he when he died.

24:16 And they buried him in the city of @ @ the kings,
@ he had done good in @, both toward God, and toward his
@.

24:17 Now @ the @^ of Jehoiada came the princes of @, and
made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

24:18 And they left the @ of the LORD God of @ @s, and
served groves and idols: and wrath came upon @ and @  for
this @ trespass.

24:19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to @( them @* unto the LORD;
and they testified @
 them: but they @L not give ear.

24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
the @6, @ stood above the @, and said unto them, Thus
@
 God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye
cannot prosper? @ ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also
forsaken you.

24:21 And they conspired @
 him, and stoned him with stones at
the commandment of the king in the court of the @ of the LORD.

24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness @ Jehoiada
his @ had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he
said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

24:23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
Syria came up @
 him: and they came to @ and @ , and
destroyed all the princes of the @ from @ the @, and
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.

24:24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
and the LORD delivered a very @ host into @ hand, @ they
had forsaken the LORD God of @ @s. So they executed judgment
@
 Joash.

24:25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
@ diseases,) his own @<s conspired @
 him for the @I
of the sons of Jehoiada the @6, and slew him on his bed, and he
died: and they buried him in the city of @, but they buried him
not in the sepulchres of the kings.

24:26 And @ are they that conspired @
 him; Zabad the son of
Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.

24:27 Now concerning his sons, and the @ness of the burdens laid
upon him, and the repairing of the @ of God, @%, they are
written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son
reigned in his stead.

25:1 Amaziah was twenty and five @8 old when he began to reign, and
he reigned twenty and nine @8 in @ . And his m@C's name
was Jehoaddan of @ .

25:2 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD, but not
with a perfect @.

25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
that he slew his @<s that had killed the king his @.

25:4 But he slew not @ @, but did as it is written in the
law in the book of @, where the LORD @M, @, The
@s @ not die for the @, @" @ the @ die
for the @s, but @ man @ die for his own sin.

25:5 Moreover Amaziah ga@d @ @?, and made them captains
over @:s, and captains over @/s, @$ to the @s of
@ @s, @Eout all @ and Benjamin: and he numbered them
from twenty @8 old and above, and @V them @@ @/ @:
choice men, able to go @ to war, that could handle spear and
shield.

25:6 He hired also an @/ @: @By men of valour out of
@ for an @/ talents of silver.

25:7 But @ came a man of God to him, @, O king, let not the
army of @ go with thee; for the LORD is not with @, to wit,
with all the @ of Ephraim.

25:8 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God @
make thee fall @	 the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to
cast down.

25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what @ we do for the
@/ talents @ I have @= to the army of @? And the man
of God @>, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.

25:10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
him out of Ephraim, to go home @*: wherefore @ anger was
@ly kindled @
 @, and they returned home in @ anger.

25:11 And Amaziah strengthened @9, and led @ his @, and
went to the valley of salt, and smote of the @ of Seir ten
@:.

25:12 And @C ten @: left alive did the @ of @
carry away captive, and @ them unto the top of the rock, and
cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in
pieces.

25:13 But the soldiers of the army @ Amaziah sent back, that they
@# not go with him to battle, fell upon the @G of @, from
Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote @@ @: of them, and
took much spoil.

25:14 Now it came to pass, @ that Amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the Edomites, that he @ the gods of the @ of
Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down @9 @	
them, and burned incense unto them.

25:15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled @
 Amaziah, and
he sent unto him a prophet, @ said unto him, Why hast thou sought
@ the gods of the @, @ could not deliver @ own @
out of @ hand?  25:16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him,
that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?
forbear; why @#est thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and
said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, @ thou
hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

25:17 Then Amaziah king of @ took advice, and sent to Joash, the
son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of @, @, Come, let us
see one @F in the face.

25:18 And Joash king of @ sent to Amaziah king of @, @,
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
@, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and @ passed by a
wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

25:19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and @ @
lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why @#est thou meddle
to @ hurt, that thou @#est fall, even thou, and @ with
thee?  25:20 But Amaziah @L not hear; for it came of God, that he
@B deliver them into the hand of @ enemies, @ they sought
@ the gods of Edom.

25:21 So Joash the king of @ went up; and they saw one @F in
the face, both he and Amaziah king of @, at Bethshemesh, @
belongeth to @.

25:22 And @ was put to the worse @	 @, and they fled
@ man to his tent.

25:23 And Joash the king of @ took Amaziah king of @, the son
of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and @ him to
@ , and brake down the wall of @  from the gate of
Ephraim to the corner gate, four @/ cubits.

25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
that were @V in the @ of God with Obededom, and the treasures
of the king's @, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of @ lived @ the @^
of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of @ fifteen @8.

25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, @O and last, @%, are
they not written in the book of the kings of @ and @?  25:27
Now @ the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD
they made a conspiracy @
 him in @ ; and he fled to
Lachish: but they sent to Lachish @ him, and slew him @.

25:28 And they @ him upon horses, and buried him with his
@s in the city of @.

26:1 Then all the @ of @ took Uzziah, who was sixteen @8
old, and made him king in the room of his @ Amaziah.

26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to @, @ that the king
slept with his @s.

26:3 Sixteen @8 old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
reigned fifty and two @8 in @ . His m@C's name also was
Jecoliah of @ .

26:4 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD,
@$ to all that his @ Amaziah did.

26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had @[standing
in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him
to prosper.

26:6 And he went @ and warred @
 the Philistines, and brake
down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,
and built @G @+ Ashdod, and @ the Philistines.

26:7 And God helped him @
 the Philistines, and @
 the
Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
abroad even to the entering in of @-; for he strengthened @9
exceedingly.

26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in @  at the corner gate, and
at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified
them.

26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains:
husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel:
for he loved husbandry.

26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
war by bands, @$ to the number of @ account by the hand of
Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, @[ the hand of Hananiah,
one of the king's captains.

26:12 The whole number of the chief of the @s of the @By men
of valour were two @: and six @/.

26:13 And @[ @ hand was an army, @@ @/ @: and
@H @: and five @/, that made war with @By power, to
help the king @
 the enemy.

26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them @Eout all the host shields,
and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
stones.

26:15 And he made in @  engines, invented by cunning men, to be
on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and @ stones
withal.

And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till
he was strong.

26:16 But when he was strong, his @ was lifted up to his
destruction: for he transgressed @
 the LORD his God, and went
into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the @\ of incense.

26:17 And Azariah the @6 went in @ him, and with him fourscore
@6s of the LORD, that were valiant men: 26:18 And they withstood
Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,
Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the @6s the sons of
Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary;
for thou hast trespassed; @" @ it be for @ honour from
the LORD God.

26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
incense: and while he was wroth with the @6s, the leprosy even
rose up in his forehead @	 the @6s in the @ of the LORD,
from beside the incense @\.

26:20 And Azariah the chief @6, and all the @6s, looked upon
him, and, @%, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him
out from thence; yea, @9 hasted also to go out, @ the LORD
had smitten him.

26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his @^, and
dwelt in a several @, being a leper; for he was cut off from the
@ of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's @,
judging the @ of the land.

26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, @O and last, did Isaiah
the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

26:23 So Uzziah slept with his @s, and they buried him with his
@s in the field of the burial @ belonged to the kings; for
they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

27:1 Jotham was twenty and five @8 old when he began to reign, and
he reigned sixteen @8 in @ . His m@C's name also was
Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

27:2 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD,
@$ to all that his @ Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not
into the temple of the LORD. And the @ did yet corruptly.

27:3 He built the high gate of the @ of the LORD, and on the wall
of Ophel he built much.

27:4 Moreover he built @G in the mountains of @, and in the
forests he built castles and towers.

27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
@
 them. And the @ of Ammon gave him the same year an
@/ talents of silver, and ten @: measures of wheat, and ten
@: of barley. So much did the @ of Ammon pay unto him,
both the second year, and the third.

27:6 So Jotham became @By, @ he prepared his ways @	 the
LORD his God.

27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of @ and
@.

27:8 He was five and twenty @8 old when he began to reign, and
reigned sixteen @8 in @ .

27:9 And Jotham slept with his @s, and they buried him in the
city of @: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

28:1 Ahaz was twenty @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
sixteen @8 in @ : but he did not that @ was @c in the
sight of the LORD, like @ his @: 28:2 For he walked in the
ways of the kings of @, and made also molten images for Baalim.

28:3 Moreover he @_ incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
@_ his @ in the fire, @ the abominations of the heathen
whom the LORD had cast out @	 the @ of @.

28:4 He sacrificed also and @_ incense in the high @'s, and on
the hills, and @[ @ green tree.

28:5 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a @ multitude
of them captives, and @ them to Damascus. And he was also
delivered into the hand of the king of @, who smote him with a
@ slaughter.

28:6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in @ an @/ and twenty
@: in one day, @ were all valiant men; @ they had
forsaken the LORD God of @ @s.

28:7 And Zichri, a @By man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
son, and Azrikam the governor of the @, and Elkanah that was next
to the king.

28:8 And the @ of @ carried away captive of @ @3
two @/ @:, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away
much spoil from them, and @ the spoil to Samaria.

28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was @, whose name was Oded: and he
went out @	 the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them,
@., @ the LORD God of your @s was wroth with @, he
hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage
that reacheth up unto @1.

28:10 And now ye purpose to keep @[ the @ of @ and
@  for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are @ not with
you, even with you, sins @
 the LORD your God?  28:11 Now hear me
@fore, and deliver the captives @*, @ ye have taken captive
of your @3: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.

28:12 Then certain of the heads of the @ of Ephraim, Azariah
the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah
the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up @
 them
that came from the war, 28:13 And said unto them, Ye @ not @(
in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended @
 the LORD
already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for
our trespass is @, and @ is fierce wrath @
 @.

28:14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil @	 the
princes and all the @`.

28:15 And the men @ were expressed by name rose up, and took the
captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked @ them,
and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to @b,
and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and
@ them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to @ @3:
then they returned to Samaria.

28:16 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
help him.

28:17 For @* the Edomites had come and smitten @, and carried
away captives.

28:18 The Philistines also had invaded the @G of the low country,
and of the south of @, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and
Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages @of, and Timnah with the
villages @of, Gimzo also and the villages @of: and they dwelt
@.

28:19 For the LORD @ @ low @ of Ahaz king of @;
for he made @ naked, and transgressed sore @
 the LORD.

28:20 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
distressed him, but strengthened him not.

28:21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the @ of the LORD, and
out of the @ of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the
king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

28:22 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more @

the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

28:23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, @ smote him:
and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
@fore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they
were the ruin of him, and of all @.

28:24 And Ahaz ga@d @? the vessels of the @ of God, and
cut in pieces the vessels of the @ of God, and shut up the doors
of the @ of the LORD, and he made him @\s in @ corner of
@ .

28:25 And in @ several city of @ he made high @'s to burn
incense unto @C gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his
@s.

28:26 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, @O and last,
@%, they are written in the book of the kings of @ and @.

28:27 And Ahaz slept with his @s, and they buried him in the
city, even in @ : but they @ him not into the sepulchres
of the kings of @: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty @8 old,
and he reigned nine and twenty @8 in @ . And his m@C's
name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

29:2 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD,
@$ to all that @ his @ had done.

29:3 He in the @O year of his reign, in the @O month, opened the
doors of the @ of the LORD, and repaired them.

29:4 And he @ in the @6s and the Levites, and ga@d them
@? into the east street, 29:5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye
Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the @ of the LORD
God of your @s, and carry @ the fil@ss out of the holy
@'.

29:6 For our @s have trespassed, and done that @ was evil in
the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned
away @ faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned @
backs.

29:7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered @_ @&s in the
holy @' unto the God of @.

29:8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon @ and @ , and
he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as
ye see with your eyes.

29:9 For, lo, our @s have fallen by the @Q, and our sons and
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

29:10 Now it is in mine @ to make a covenant with the LORD God of
@, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

29:11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
stand @	 him, to serve him, and that ye @# minister unto him,
and burn incense.

29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of
Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of
the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
29:13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons
of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 29:14 And of the sons of Heman;
Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

29:15 And they ga@d @ @3, and sanctified @T, and
came, @$ to the commandment of the king, by the @5 of the
LORD, to cleanse the @ of the LORD.

29:16 And the @6s went into the inner part of the @ of the
LORD, to cleanse it, and @ out all the uncleanness that they
@V in the temple of the LORD into the court of the @ of the
LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook
Kidron.

29:17 Now they began on the @O day of the @O month to sanctify,
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD:
so they sanctified the @ of the LORD in eight days; and in the
sixteenth day of the @O month they made an end.

29:18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
cleansed all the @ of the LORD, and the @\ of @_ @&,
with all the vessels @of, and the shew@d table, with all the
vessels @of.

29:19 Moreover all the vessels, @ king Ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and,
@%, they are @	 the @\ of the LORD.

29:20 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and ga@d the rulers of
the city, and went up to the @ of the LORD.

29:21 And they @ @H bullocks, and @H rams, and @H
lambs, and @H he goats, for a sin @& for the kingdom, and for
the sanctuary, and for @. And he @M the @6s the sons of
Aaron to offer them on the @\ of the LORD.

29:22 So they killed the bullocks, and the @6s received the @I,
and sprinkled it on the @\: likewise, when they had killed the
rams, they sprinkled the @I upon the @\: they killed also the
lambs, and they sprinkled the @I upon the @\.

29:23 And they @ @ the he goats for the sin @& @	
the king and the @`; and they laid @ @D upon them:
29:24 And the @6s killed them, and they made reconciliation with
@ @I upon the @\, to make an atonement for all @: for
the king @M that the @_ @& and the sin @& @#
be made for all @.

29:25 And he set the Levites in the @ of the LORD with cymbals,
with psalteries, and with harps, @$ to the commandment of
@, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was
the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of @, and the
@6s with the trumpets.

29:27 And Hezekiah @M to offer the @_ @& upon the
@\.

And when the @_ @& began, the song of the LORD began also
with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by @ king of
@.

29:28 And all the @` worshipped, and the singers sang, and
the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the @_
@& was finished.

29:29 And when they had made an end of @&, the king and all that
were present with him bowed @T, and worshipped.

29:30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes @M the Levites
to sing praise unto the LORD with the @5 of @, and of Asaph the
seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed @ heads
and worshipped.

29:31 Then Hezekiah @> and said, Now ye have consecrated
yourselves unto the LORD, come near and @( sacrifices and thank
@&s into the @ of the LORD. And the @` @ in
sacrifices and thank @&s; and as many as were of a free @
@_ @&s.

29:32 And the number of the @_ @&s, @ the @`
@, was @@score and ten bullocks, an @/ rams, and two
@/ lambs: all @ were for a @_ @& to the LORD.

29:33 And the consecrated @ were six @/ oxen and @@
@: sheep.

29:34 But the @6s were too few, so that they could not flay all
the @_ @&s: wherefore @ @3 the Levites did help
them, till the work was ended, and until the @C @6s had
sanctified @T: for the Levites were more up@c in @ to
sanctify @T than the @6s.

29:35 And also the @_ @&s were in abundance, with the fat of
the @U @&s, and the @b @&s for @ @_ @&.
So the service of the @ of the LORD was set in order.

29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the @, that God had prepared
the @: for the @7 was done suddenly.

30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all @ and @, and wrote letters also
to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they @# come to the @ of the
LORD at @ , to keep the passover unto the LORD God of @.

30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
@` in @ , to keep the passover in the second month.

30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, @ the @6s had
not sanctified @T sufficiently, @" had the @
ga@d @T @? to @ .

30:4 And the @7 pleased the king and all the @`.

30:5 So they established a decree to make proclamation @Eout all
@, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they @# come to keep the
passover unto the LORD God of @ at @ : for they had not
done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.

30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
@Eout all @ and @, and @$ to the commandment of
the king, @, Ye @ of @, turn @* unto the LORD God
of Abraham, Isaac, and @, and he will return to the remnant of
you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

30:7 And be not ye like your @s, and like your @3, @
trespassed @
 the LORD God of @ @s, who @fore gave
them up to desolation, as ye see.

30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your @s were, but yield
yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, @ he hath
sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness
of his wrath may turn away from you.

30:9 For if ye turn @* unto the LORD, your @3 and your
@ @ find compassion @	 them that lead them captive, so
that they @ come @* into this land: for the LORD your God is
gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye
return unto him.

30:10 So the posts passed from city to city @E the country of
Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to
scorn, and mocked them.

30:11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
@T, and came to @ .

30:12 Also in @ the hand of God was to give them one @ to do
the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the
LORD.

30:13 And @ assembled at @  much @ to keep the feast
of unleavened @d in the second month, a very @ @`.

30:14 And they arose and took away the @\s that were in @ ,
and all the @\s for incense took they away, and cast them into the
brook Kidron.

30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
second month: and the @6s and the Levites were ashamed, and
sanctified @T, and @ in the @_ @&s into the
@ of the LORD.

30:16 And they stood in @ @' @ @ manner, @$ to
the law of @ the man of God: the @6s sprinkled the @I,
@ they received of the hand of the Levites.

30:17 For @ were many in the @` that were not
sanctified: @fore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the
passovers for @ one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the
LORD.

30:18 For a multitude of the @, even many of Ephraim, and
Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed @T, yet did
they eat the passover @Cwise than it was written. But Hezekiah
prayed for them, @, The good LORD pardon @ one 30:19 That
prepareth his @ to seek God, the LORD God of his @s, though
he be not cleansed @$ to the purification of the sanctuary.

30:20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the @.

30:21 And the @ of @ that were present at @  kept
the feast of unleavened @d @H days with @ gladness: and the
Levites and the @6s praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud
instruments unto the LORD.

30:22 And Hezekiah @0 comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat @Eout the feast
@H days, @& @U @&s, and making confession to the
LORD God of @ @s.

30:23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep @C @H days:
and they kept @C @H days with gladness.

30:24 For Hezekiah king of @ did give to the @` a
@: bullocks and @H @: sheep; and the princes gave to
the @` a @: bullocks and ten @: sheep: and a
@ number of @6s sanctified @T.

30:25 And all the @` of @, with the @6s and the
Levites, and all the @` that came out of @, and the
strangers that came out of the land of @, and that dwelt in
@, rejoiced.

30:26 So @ was @ joy in @ : for since the time of
Solomon the son of @ king of @ @ was not the like in
@ .

30:27 Then the @6s the Levites arose and blessed the @: and
@ @; was @), and @ prayer came up to his holy dwelling
@', even unto @1.

31:1 Now when all this was finished, all @ that were present went
out to the @G of @, and brake the images in pieces, and cut
down the groves, and threw down the high @'s and the @\s out of
all @ and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had
utterly destroyed them all. Then all the @ of @ returned,
@ man to his possession, into @ own @G.

31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the @6s and the Levites
@ @ courses, @ man @$ to his service, the @6s
and Levites for @_ @&s and for @U @&s, to minister,
and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the
LORD.

31:3 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
@_ @&s, to wit, for the morning and evening @_ @&s,
and the @_ @&s for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and
for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.

31:4 Moreover he @M the @ that dwelt in @  to give
the portion of the @6s and the Levites, that they @B be
encouraged in the law of the LORD.

31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the @ of
@ @ in abundance the @Ofruits of corn, wine, and oil,
and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all
@ @ they in abundantly.

31:6 And concerning the @ of @ and @, that dwelt in
the @G of @, they also @ in the tithe of oxen and sheep,
and the tithe of holy @ @ were consecrated unto the LORD
@ God, and laid them by heaps.

31:7 In the third month they began to lay the @Vation of the heaps,
and finished them in the @Hth month.

31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
blessed the LORD, and his @ @.

31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the @6s and the Levites
concerning the heaps.

31:10 And Azariah the chief @6 of the @ of Zadok @> him,
and said, Since the @ began to @( the @&s into the @
of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the
LORD hath blessed his @; and that @ is left is this @
store.

31:11 Then Hezekiah @M to prepare chambers in the @ of the
LORD; and they prepared them, 31:12 And @ in the @&s and
the tithes and the dedicated @ faithfully: over @ Cononiah
the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his @X was the next.

31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were
overseers @[ the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his @X, at the
commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the @
of God.

31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
east, was over the freewill @&s of God, to distribute the
oblations of the LORD, and the most holy @.

31:15 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the @G of the @6s, in @ set
office, to give to @ @3 by courses, as well to the @ as

old and upward, even unto @ one that entereth into the @ of
the LORD, his daily portion for @ service in @ charges
@$ to @ courses; 31:17 Both to the genealogy of the @6s
by the @ of @ @s, and the Levites from twenty @8 old
and upward, in @ charges by @ courses; 31:18 And to the
genealogy of all @ little ones, @ wives, and @ sons, and
@ daughters, @E all the @`: for in @ set office
they sanctified @T in holiness: 31:19 Also of the sons of
Aaron the @6s, @ were in the fields of the suburbs of @
@G, in @ several city, the men that were expressed by name, to
give portions to all the males @ the @6s, and to all that were
reckoned by genealogies @ the Levites.

31:20 And thus did Hezekiah @Eout all @, and wrought that
@ was good and @c and truth @	 the LORD his God.

31:21 And in @ work that he began in the service of the @ of
God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did
it with all his @, and prospered.

32:1 After @ @, and the establishment @of, Sennacherib
king of Assyria came, and entered into @, and encamped @
 the
fenced @G, and thought to win them for @9.

32:2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
purposed to fight @
 @ , 32:3 He took counsel with his
princes and his @By men to stop the @Zs of the fountains @
were @S the city: and they did help him.

32:4 So @ was ga@d much @ @?, who stopped all the
fountains, and the brook that ran @E the @a of the land,
@, Why @# the kings of Assyria come, and find much @Z?
32:5 Also he strengthened @9, and built up all the wall that was
broken, and raised it up to the towers, and @F wall @S, and
repaired Millo in the city of @, and made darts and shields in
abundance.

32:6 And he set captains of war over the @, and ga@d them
@? to him in the street of the gate of the city, and @0
comfortably to them, @, 32:7 Be strong and courageous, be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude
that is with him: for @ be more with us than with him: 32:8 With
him is an arm of @R; but with us is the LORD our God to help us,
and to fight our battles. And the @ rested @T upon the
@5 of Hezekiah king of @.

32:9 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his @<s to
@ , (but he @9 laid siege @
 Lachish, and all his
power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of @, and unto all @ that
were at @ , @, 32:10 Thus @
 Sennacherib king of
Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in @ ?
32:11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
famine and by thirst, @, The LORD our God @ deliver us out of
the hand of the king of Assyria?  32:12 Hath not the same Hezekiah
taken away his high @'s and his @\s, and @M @ and
@ , @, Ye @ worship @	 one @\, and burn incense
upon it?  32:13 Know ye not what I and my @s have done unto all
the @ of @C lands? were the gods of the nations of @J lands
any ways able to deliver @ lands out of mine hand?  32:14 Who was
@ @ all the gods of @J nations that my @s utterly
destroyed, that could deliver his @ out of mine hand, that your
God @# be able to deliver you out of mine hand?  32:15 Now
@fore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
manner, @" yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom
was able to deliver his @ out of mine hand, and out of the hand
of my @s: how much less @ your God deliver you out of mine
hand?  32:16 And his @<s @0 yet more @
 the LORD God, and
@
 his @< Hezekiah.

32:17 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of @, and to
@K @
 him, @, As the gods of the nations of @C lands
have not delivered @ @ out of mine hand, so @ not the God
of Hezekiah deliver his @ out of mine hand.

32:18 Then they cried with a loud @; in the Jews' speech unto the
@ of @  that were on the wall, to aff@c them, and to
trouble them; that they @B take the city.

32:19 And they @0 @
 the God of @ , as @
 the gods
of the @ of the @, @ were the work of the @D of man.

32:20 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the
son of Amoz, prayed and cried to @1.

32:21 And the LORD sent an angel, @ cut off all the @By men of
valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when
he was come into the @ of his god, they that came @ of his own
bowels slew him @ with the @Q.

32:22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of @ 
from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of
all @C, and guided them on @ side.

32:23 And many @ gifts unto the LORD to @ , and presents
to Hezekiah king of @: so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thence@.

32:24 In @J days Hezekiah was sick to the @^, and prayed unto
the LORD: and he @0 unto him, and he gave him a sign.

32:25 But Hezekiah rendered not @* @$ to the benefit done
unto him; for his @ was lifted up: @fore @ was wrath upon
him, and upon @ and @ .

32:26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled @9 for the pride of his
@, both he and the inhabitants of @ , so that the wrath of
the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

32:27 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
@9 treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones,
and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant
jewels; 32:28 Store@s also for the increase of corn, and wine, and
oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

32:29 Moreover he provided him @G, and possessions of flocks and
herds in abundance: for God had @= him substance very much.

32:30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper @Zcourse of Gihon,
and @ it straight down to the west side of the city of @.
And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

32:31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in
the land, God left him, to try him, that he @B know all that was in
his @.

32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, @%,
they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,
and in the book of the kings of @ and @.

32:33 And Hezekiah slept with his @s, and they buried him in the
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of @: and all @ and the
inhabitants of @  did him honour at his @^. And Manasseh his
son reigned in his stead.

33:1 Manasseh was twelve @8 old when he began to reign, and he
reigned fifty and five @8 in @ : 33:2 But did that @ was
evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the
heathen, whom the LORD had cast out @	 the @ of @.

33:3 For he built @* the high @'s @ Hezekiah his @ had
broken down, and he reared up @\s for Baalim, and made groves, and
worshipped all the host of @1, and served them.

33:4 Also he built @\s in the @ of the LORD, whereof the LORD
had said, In @  @ my name be for ever.

33:5 And he built @\s for all the host of @1 in the two courts
of the @ of the LORD.

33:6 And he caused his @ to pass @E the fire in the valley
of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments,
and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with
wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
to anger.

33:7 And he set a carved image, the idol @ he had made, in the
@ of God, of @ God had said to @ and to Solomon his son,
In this @, and in @ , @ I have chosen @	 all the
tribes of @, will I put my name for ever: 33:8 Neither will I any
more remove the foot of @ from out of the land @ I have
appointed for your @s; so that they will take heed to do all that
I have @M them, @$ to the whole law and the statutes and
the ordinances by the hand of @.

33:9 So Manasseh made @ and the inhabitants of @  to err,
and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed @	
the @ of @.

33:10 And the LORD @0 to Manasseh, and to his @: but they
@L not hearken.

33:11 Wherefore the LORD @ upon them the captains of the host of
the king of Assyria, @ took Manasseh @ the thorns, and bound
him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

33:12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
humbled @9 @ly @	 the God of his @s, 33:13 And
prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and @) his
supplication, and @ him @* to @  into his kingdom.
Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

33:14 Now @ this he built a wall @S the city of @, on the
west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish
gate, and compassed @+ Ophel, and raised it up a very @ height,
and put captains of war in all the fenced @G of @.

33:15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the @
of the LORD, and all the @\s that he had built in the mount of the
@ of the LORD, and in @ , and cast them out of the city.

33:16 And he repaired the @\ of the LORD, and sacrificed @on
@U @&s and thank @&s, and @M @ to serve the
LORD God of @.

33:17 Nevertheless the @ did sacrifice still in the high @'s,
yet unto the LORD @ God only.

33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
God, and the @5 of the seers that @0 to him in the name of the
LORD God of @, @%, they are written in the book of the kings
of @.

33:19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
sins, and his trespass, and the @'s wherein he built high @'s,
and set up groves and graven images, @	 he was humbled: @%,
they are written @ the @s of the seers.

33:20 So Manasseh slept with his @s, and they buried him in his
own @: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

33:21 Amon was two and twenty @8 old when he began to reign, and
reigned two @8 in @ .

33:22 But he did that @ was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
Manasseh his @: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
@ Manasseh his @ had made, and served them; 33:23 And humbled
not @9 @	 the LORD, as Manasseh his @ had humbled
@9; but Amon trespassed more and more.

33:24 And his @<s conspired @
 him, and slew him in his own
@.

33:25 But the @ of the land slew all them that had conspired
@
 king Amon; and the @ of the land made Josiah his son king
in his stead.

34:1 Josiah was eight @8 old when he began to reign, and he reigned
in @  one and thirty @8.

34:2 And he did that @ was @c in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in the ways of @ his @, and declined @" to the
@c hand, nor to the left.

34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he
began to seek @ the God of @ his @: and in the twelfth
year he began to purge @ and @  from the high @'s, and
the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.

34:4 And they brake down the @\s of Baalim in his presence; and the
images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and
the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made
dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had
sacrificed unto them.

34:5 And he @_ the bones of the @6s upon @ @\s, and
cleansed @ and @ .

34:6 And so did he in the @G of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
even unto Naphtali, with @ mattocks round @+.

34:7 And when he had broken down the @\s and the groves, and had
beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols
@Eout all the land of @, he returned to @ .

34:8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the
land, and the @, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah
the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to
repair the @ of the LORD his God.

34:9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high @6, they delivered the
money that was @ into the @ of God, @ the Levites that
kept the doors had ga@d of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and
of all the remnant of @, and of all @ and Benjamin; and they
returned to @ .

34:10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the @ of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen
that wrought in the @ of the LORD, to repair and amend the @:
34:11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the @s @ the

34:12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them

Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it

34:13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers

34:18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, @, Hilkiah the

34:19 And it came to pass, when the king had @) the @5 of the

34:22 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to

34:26 And as for the king of @, who sent you to enquire of the

34:30 And the king went up into the @ of the LORD, and all the men

34:31 And the king stood in his @', and made a covenant @	 the

34:32 And he caused all that were present in @  and Benjamin to

34:33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the

all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of

35:1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in @ : and
they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the @O month.

35:2 And he set the @6s in @ charges, and encouraged them to
the service of the @ of the LORD, 35:3 And said unto the Levites
that taught all @, @ were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy

35:5 And stand in the holy @' @$ to the divisions of the

35:6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your

35:7 And Josiah gave to the @, of the flock, lambs and kids, all

35:8 And his princes gave willingly unto the @, to the @6s,

35:9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his @3, and
Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the
Levites for passover @&s five @: small cattle, and five

35:10 So the service was prepared, and the @6s stood in @

35:11 And they killed the passover, and the @6s sprinkled the

35:12 And they removed the @_ @&s, that they @B give
@$ to the divisions of the families of the @, to offer

35:13 And they roasted the passover with fire @$ to the

35:14 And @ward they made ready for @T, and for the

35:15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in @ @', @$

king's seer; and the porters waited at @ gate; they @B not
depart from @ service; for @ @3 the Levites prepared for

35:16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
keep the passover, and to offer @_ @&s upon the @\ of the
LORD, @$ to the commandment of king Josiah.

35:17 And the @ of @ that were present kept the passover
at that time, and the feast of unleavened @d @H days.

35:18 And @ was no passover like to that kept in @ from the

all @ and @ that were present, and the inhabitants of

35:19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
kept.

35:20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king
of @- came up to fight @
 Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah
went out @
 him.

35:21 But he sent ambassadors to him, @, What have I to do with

 thee this day, but
@
 the @ wherewith I have war: for God @M me to make

35:22 Nevertheless Josiah @L not turn his face from him, but
disguised @9, that he @B fight with him, and hearkened not
unto the @5 of Necho from the @P of God, and came to fight in
the valley of Megiddo.

35:23 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
@<s, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

35:24 His @<s @fore took him out of that chariot, and put him

And all @ and @  mourned for Josiah.

35:25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and

and made them an ordinance in @: and, @%, they are written in

35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, @$

@O and last, @%, they are written in the book of the kings of

36:1 Then the @ of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and

36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty and five @8 old when he began to reign,

36:6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him
in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the @ of the

36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations @

36:9 Jehoiachin was eight @8 old when he began to reign, and he

36:14 Moreover all the chief of the @6s, and the @,

polluted the @ of the LORD @ he had hallowed in @ .

36:15 And the LORD God of @ @s sent to them by his

36:17 @N he @ upon them the king of the Chaldees, who

36:22 Now in the @O year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of

LORD, they set the @6s in @ apparel with trumpets, and the
Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, @ the
ordinance of @ king of @.

3:11 And they sang @? by course in praising and giving thanks
unto the LORD; @ he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever
toward @.

And all the @ shouted with a @ shout, when they praised the
LORD, @ the @Vation of the @ of the LORD was laid.

3:12 But many of the @6s and Levites and chief of the @s, who
were ancient men, that had seen the @O @, when the @Vation
of this @ was laid @	 @ eyes, wept with a loud @;; and
many shouted aloud for joy: 3:13 So that the @ could not discern
the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the
@: for the @ shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was
@) afar off.

4:1 Now when the adversaries of @ and Benjamin @) that the
@ of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of
@; 4:2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the
@s, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
Esarhaddon king of Assur, @ @ us up hither.

4:3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
@s of @, said unto them, Ye have no@7 to do with us to
build an @ unto our God; but we ourselves @? will build unto
the LORD God of @, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath
@M us.

4:4 Then the @ of the land weakened the @D of the @ of
@, and troubled them in building, 4:5 And hired counsellors
@
 them, to frustrate @ purpose, all the days of Cyrus king
of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.

4:6 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
wrote they unto him an accusation @
 the inhabitants of @ and
@ .

4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
and the rest of @ companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and
the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and
interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

4:8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
@
 @  to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 4:9 Then wrote
Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of @
companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the
Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the
Dehavites, and the Elamites, 4:10 And the rest of the nations whom the
@ and noble Asnapper @ over, and set in the @G of
Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a
time.

4:11 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto
Artaxerxes the king; Thy @<s the men on this side the river, and
at such a time.

4:12 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews @ came up from thee
to us are come unto @ , building the rebellious and the bad
city, and have set up the walls @of, and joined the @Vations.

4:13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and
the walls set up @*, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and
custom, and so thou @ endamage the revenue of the kings.

4:14 Now @ we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, @fore have we
sent and certified the king; 4:15 That search may be made in the book

4:16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded @*, and the
walls @of set up, by this means thou @ have no portion on this

4:17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of @ companions that dwell in
Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a
time.

4:18 The letter @ ye sent unto us hath been plainly read @	
me.

4:19 And I @M, and search hath been made, and it is @V that
this city of old time hath made insurrection @
 kings, and that
rebellion and sedition have been made @in.

4:20 There have been @By kings also over @ , @ have
ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and
custom, was paid unto them.

4:21 Give ye now commandment to cause @ men to cease, and that
this city be not builded, until @F commandment @ be @=

4:22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why @# damage grow
to the hurt of the kings?  4:23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes'
letter was read @	 Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and @
companions, they went up in haste to @  unto the Jews, and made
them to cease by force and power.

4:24 Then ceased the work of the @ of God @ is at @ .
So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of
Persia.

5:1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of
Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in @ and @  in the
name of the God of @, even unto them.

5:2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son
of Jozadak, and began to build the @ of God @ is at @ :
and with them were the prophets of God helping them.

5:3 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the
river, and Shetharboznai and @ companions, and said thus unto
them, Who hath @M you to build this @, and to make up this
wall?  5:4 Then said we unto them @ this manner, What are the
names of the men that make this building?  5:5 But the eye of @
God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to
cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer
by letter concerning this matter.

5:6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, @
were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 5:7 They sent
a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all
@U.

5:8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
Judea, to the @ of the @ God, @ is builded with @
stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on,
and prospereth in @ @D.

5:9 Then asked we @J elders, and said unto them thus, Who @M
you to build this @, and to make up @ walls?  5:10 We asked
@ names also, to certify thee, that we @B write the names of
the men that were the chief of them.

5:11 And thus they returned us answer, @, We are the @<s of
the God of @1 and @, and build the @ that was builded
@ many @8 ago, @ a @ king of @ builded and set up.

5:12 But @ that our @s had provoked the God of @1 unto
wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this @, and carried the
@ away into Babylon.

5:13 But in the @O year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king
Cyrus made a decree to build this @ of God.

5:14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the @ of God,
@ Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in @ , and
@ them into the temple of Babylon, @J did Cyrus the king take
out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose
name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 5:15 And said unto
him, Take @ vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in
@ , and let the @ of God be builded in his @'.

5:16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the @Vation of the
@ of God @ is in @ : and since that time even until now
hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.

5:17 Now @fore, if it seem good to the king, let @ be search
made in the king's treasure @, @ is @ at Babylon, whether
it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this @
of God at @ , and let the king send his pleasure to us
concerning this matter.

6:1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
@ of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.

6:2 And @ was @V at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
province of the Medes, a roll, and @in was a record thus written:
6:3 In the @O year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a

6:6 Now @fore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai,
and your companions the Apharsachites, @ are beyond the river, be

6:8 Moreover I make a decree what ye @ do to the elders of @
Jews for the building of this @ of God: that of the king's goods,

6:9 And that @ they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams,

6:11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever @ alter this word,
let timber be pulled down from his @, and being set up, let him be
hanged @on; and let his @ be made a dunghill for this.

6:12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell @ destroy all
kings and @, that @ put to @ hand to alter and to destroy
this @ of God @ is at @ . I Darius have made a decree;
let it be done with speed.

6:13 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and
@ companions, @$ to that @ Darius the king had sent, so
they did speedily.

6:14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered @E
the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.
And they builded, and finished it, @$ to the commandment of the
God of @, and @$ to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius,
and Artaxerxes king of Persia.

6:15 And this @ was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
@ was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.

6:16 And the @ of @, the @6s, and the Levites, and the

6:17 And offered at the dedication of this @ of God an @/

6:18 And they set the @6s in @ divisions, and the Levites in

6:19 And the @ of the captivity kept the passover upon the

6:20 For the @6s and the Levites were purified @?, all of

6:21 And the @ of @, @ were come @* out of

7:1 Now @ @ @, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,
Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 7:2
The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 7:3 The son

Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 7:5 The son of Abishua,
the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief
@6: 7:6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe

7:7 And @ went up some of the @ of @, and of the

7:8 And he came to @  in the fifth month, @ was in the

7:9 For upon the @O day of the @O month began he to go up from
Babylon, and on the @O day of the fifth month came he to @ ,
@$ to the good hand of his God upon him.

7:10 For Ezra had prepared his @ to seek the law of the LORD, and
to do it, and to teach in @ statutes and judgments.

7:11 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
unto Ezra the @6, the scribe, even a scribe of the @5 of the

7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the @6, a scribe of the

7:13 I make a decree, that all they of the @ of @, and of

7:20 And whatsoever more @ be needful for the @ of thy God,

7:21 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the

7:25 And thou, Ezra, @ the wisdom of thy God, that is in @

7:26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the

@^, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to

7:27 Blessed be the LORD God of our @s, @ hath put such a

And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and
I ga@d @? out of @ chief men to go up with me.

8:1 These are now the chief of @ @s, and this is the
genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of
Artaxerxes the king.

8:2 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
of the sons of @; Hattush.

8:3 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and
with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an @/ and fifty.

8:4 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with

8:5 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him @@
@/ males.

8:6 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
fifty males.

8:7 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with
him @Hty males.

8:8 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and
with him fourscore males.

8:9 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
@/ and eighteen males.

8:10 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him
an @/ and @@score males.

8:11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
him twenty and eight males.

8:12 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with
him an @/ and ten males.

8:13 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are @,
Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them @@score males.

8:14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
@Hty males.

8:15 And I ga@d them @? to the river that runneth to Ahava;
and @ abode we in tents @@ days: and I viewed the @, and
the @6s, and @V @ none of the sons of Levi.

8:16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for
Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for
Elnathan, men of @[standing.

8:17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the @'
Casiphia, and I told them what they @# say unto Iddo, and to his
@3 the Nethinims, at the @' Casiphia, that they @# @(
unto us ministers for the @ of our God.

8:18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they @ us a man of
@[standing, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of
@; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his @3, eighteen; 8:19
And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his
@3 and @ sons, twenty; 8:20 Also of the Nethinims, whom
@ and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites,
two @/ and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast @, at the river of Ahava, that we
@B afflict ourselves @	 our God, to seek of him a @c way for
us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.

8:22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us @
 the enemy in the way: @ we had
spoken unto the king, @, The hand of our God is upon all them for
good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is @
 all them
that forsake him.

8:23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated
of us.

8:24 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the @6s, Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of @ @3 with them, 8:25 And weighed unto
them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the @& of
the @ of our God, @ the king, and his counsellors, and his
lords, and all @ @ present, had offered: 8:26 I even weighed
unto @ hand six @/ and fifty talents of silver, and silver
vessels an @/ talents, and of gold an @/ talents; 8:27 Also
twenty basons of gold, of a @: drams; and two vessels of fine
copper, precious as gold.

8:28 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are
holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill @& unto
the LORD God of your @s.

8:29 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them @	 the chief of
the @6s and the Levites, and chief of the @s of @, at
@ , in the chambers of the @ of the LORD.

8:30 So took the @6s and the Levites the weight of the silver, and
the gold, and the vessels, to @( them to @  unto the @
of our God.

8:31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
the @O month, to go unto @ : and the hand of our God was
upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such
as lay in wait by the way.

8:32 And we came to @ , and abode @ @@ days.

8:33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the @ of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of
Uriah the @6; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and
with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of
Binnui, Levites; 8:34 By number and by weight of @ one: and all
the weight was written at that time.

8:35 Also the @ of @J that had been carried away, @ were
come out of the captivity, offered @_ @&s unto the God of
@, twelve bullocks for all @, ninety and six rams, @Hty
and @H lambs, twelve he goats for a sin @&: all this was a
@_ @& unto the LORD.

8:36 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they
fur@d the @, and the @ of God.

9:1 Now when @ @ were done, the princes came to me, @,
The @ of @, and the @6s, and the Levites, have not
separated @T from the @ of the lands, doing @$ to
@ abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the @-ians,
and the Amorites.

9:2 For they have taken of @ daughters for @T, and for
@ sons: so that the holy seed have mingled @T with the
@ of @J lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath
been chief in this trespass.

9:3 And when I @) this @7, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down
astonied.

9:4 Then were assembled unto me @ one that trembled at the @5
of the God of @, @ of the transgression of @J that had
been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.

9:5 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread
out my @D unto the LORD my God, 9:6 And said, O my God, I am
ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our
iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up
unto the @1s.

9:7 Since the days of our @s have we been in a @ trespass
unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our
@6s, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to
the @Q, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as
it is this day.

9:8 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD
our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his
holy @', that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little
reviving in our bondage.

9:9 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of
Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the @ of our God, and to
repair the desolations @of, and to give us a wall in @ and in

9:10 And now, O our God, what @ we say @ this? for we have
forsaken thy commandments, 9:11 Which thou hast @M by thy
@<s the prophets, @, The land, unto @ ye go to possess
it, is an unclean land with the fil@ss of the @ of the lands,
with @ abominations, @ have filled it from one end to @F
with @ uncleanness.

9:12 Now @fore give not your daughters unto @ sons, @"
take @ daughters unto your sons, nor seek @ @U or @
wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land,
and leave it for an inheritance to your @ for ever.

9:13 And @ all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
our @ trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less
than our iniquities deserve, and hast @= us such deliverance as
this; 9:14 Should we @* break thy commandments, and join in
affinity with the @ of @ abominations? @Lest not thou be
angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that @ @# be no
remnant nor escaping?  9:15 O LORD God of @, thou art @ceous:
for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: @%, we are @	
thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand @	 thee @ of
this.

10:1 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
casting @9 down @	 the @ of God, @ assembled unto him
out of @ a very @ @` of men and women and @:
for the @ wept very sore.

10:2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
@> and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed @
 our God, and
have taken strange wives of the @ of the land: yet now @ is
hope in @ concerning this @7.

10:3 Now @fore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
the wives, and such as are born of them, @$ to the counsel of
my lord, and of @J that tremble at the commandment of our God; and
let it be done @$ to the law.

10:4 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with
thee: be of good courage, and do it.

10:5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief @6s, the Levites, and all
@, to swear that they @# do @$ to this word. And they
sware.

10:6 Then Ezra rose up from @	 the @ of God, and went into the
chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he
did eat no @d, nor @b @Z: for he mourned @ of the
transgression of them that had been carried away.

10:7 And they made proclamation @Eout @ and @  unto
all the @ of the captivity, that they @# gather @T
@? unto @ ; 10:8 And that whosoever @L not come within
@@ days, @$ to the counsel of the princes and the elders,
all his substance @# be forfeited, and @9 separated from the

10:9 Then all the men of @ and Benjamin ga@d @T
@? unto @  within @@ days. It was the ninth month, on
the twentieth day of the month; and all the @ sat in the street
of the @ of God, trembling @ of this matter, and for the

10:10 And Ezra the @6 stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass
of @.

10:11 Now @fore make confession unto the LORD God of your @s,
and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the @ of the
land, and from the strange wives.

10:12 Then all the @` @> and said with a loud @;,
As thou hast said, so must we do.

10:13 But the @ are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
are not able to stand @S, @" is this a work of one day or
two: for we are many that have transgressed in this @7.

10:14 Let now our rulers of all the @` stand, and let all
them @ have taken strange wives in our @G come at appointed
times, and with them the elders of @ city, and the judges @of,
until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.

10:15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
were employed @+ this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the
Levite helped them.

10:16 And the @ of the captivity did so. And Ezra the @6,
with certain chief of the @s, @ the @ of @ @s,
and all of them by @ names, were separated, and sat down in the
@O day of the tenth month to examine the matter.

10:17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange

10:18 And @ the sons of the @6s @ were @V that had

10:19 And they gave @ @D that they @L put away @ wives;

The Book of Nehemiah


1:1 The @5 of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass
in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the
palace, 1:2 That Hanani, one of my @3, came, he and certain men
of @; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, @
were left of the captivity, and concerning @ .

1:3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
@ in the province are in @ affliction and reproach: the wall
of @  also is broken down, and the gates @of are burned
with fire.

1:4 And it came to pass, when I @) @ @5, that I sat down and
wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed @	 the God
of @1, 1:5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of @1, the
@ and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments: 1:6 Let @ ear now be
attentive, and @ eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of
thy @<, @ I pray @	 thee now, day and night, for the
@ of @ thy @<s, and confess the sins of the @

 thee: both I and my @'s
@ have sinned.

1:7 We have dealt very corruptly @
 thee, and have not kept the

@Mst thy @< @.

1:8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou @Mst thy

@ the nations: 1:9 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my
commandments, and do them; though @ were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the @1, yet will I gather them from thence, and
will @( them unto the @' that I have chosen to set my name
@.

1:10 Now @ are thy @<s and thy @, whom thou hast
redeemed by thy @ power, and by thy strong hand.

1:11 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now @ ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy @<, and to the prayer of thy @<s, who desire
to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy @< this day, and
grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's
cupbearer.

2:1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, that wine was @	 him: and I took up the wine,
and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been @	time sad in his
presence.

2:2 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
seeing thou art not sick? this is no@7 else but sorrow of @.
Then I was very sore afraid, 2:3 And said unto the king, Let the king
live for ever: why @# not my countenance be sad, when the city,
the @' of my @s' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates
@of are consumed with fire?  2:4 Then the king said unto me, For
what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of @1.

2:5 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
@< have @V favour in thy sight, that thou @Lest send me
unto @, unto the city of my @s' sepulchres, that I may build
it.

2:6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For
how long @ thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it
pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

2:7 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters
be @= me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me
over till I come into @; 2:8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of
the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the palace @ appertained to the @, and for the wall
of the city, and for the @ that I @ enter into. And the king
granted me, @$ to the good hand of my God upon me.

2:9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and
horsemen with me.

2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the @<, the
Ammonite, @) of it, it grieved them exceedingly that @ was come
a man to seek the welfare of the @ of @.

2:11 So I came to @ , and was @ @@ days.

2:12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; @"
told I any man what my God had put in my @ to do at @ :
@" was @ any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

2:13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even @	
the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
@ , @ were broken down, and the gates @of were consumed
with fire.

2:14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
pool: but @ was no @' for the beast that was @[ me to pass.

2:15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
returned.

2:16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; @"
had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the @6s, nor to the
nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

2:17 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
@  lieth waste, and the gates @of are burned with fire:
come, and let us build up the wall of @ , that we be no more a
reproach.

2:18 Then I told them of the hand of my God @ was good upon me; as
also the king's @5 that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let
us rise up and build. So they strengthened @ @D for this good
work.

2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the @<, the
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, @) it, they laughed us to scorn,
and despised us, and said, What is this @7 that ye do? will ye
rebel @
 the king?  2:20 Then @> I them, and said unto
them, The God of @1, he will prosper us; @fore we his @<s
will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor @c, nor memorial,
in @ .

3:1 Then Eliashib the high @6 rose up with his @3 the
@6s, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set
up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it,
unto the tower of Hananeel.

3:2 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

4:1 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat @) that we builded the
wall, he was wroth, and took @ indignation, and mocked the Jews.

4:2 And he @0 @	 his @3 and the army of Samaria, and
said, What do @ feeble Jews? will they fortify @T? will
they sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the
stones out of the heaps of the rubbish @ are burned?  4:3 Now
Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that @ they
build, if a fox go up, he @ even break down @ stone wall.

4:4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn @ reproach upon
@ own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 4:5
And cover not @ iniquity, and let not @ sin be blotted out
from @	 thee: for they have provoked thee to anger @	 the
builders.

4:6 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined @? unto
the half @of: for the @ had a mind to work.

4:7 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, @) that the walls
of @  were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,
then they were very wroth, 4:8 And conspired all of them @? to
come and to fight @
 @ , and to hinder it.

4:9 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
@
 them day and night, @ of them.

4:10 And @ said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
decayed, and @ is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build
the wall.

4:11 And our adversaries said, They @ not know, @" see, till
we come in the @a @ them, and slay them, and cause the work to
cease.

4:12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews @ dwelt by them came,
they said unto us ten times, From all @'s whence ye @ return
unto us they will be upon you.

4:13 @N set I in the lower @'s behind the wall, and on the
higher @'s, I even set the @ @ @ families with @
@Qs, @ spears, and @ bows.

4:14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
rulers, and to the rest of the @, Be not ye afraid of them:
remember the LORD, @ is @ and terrible, and fight for your
@3, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your @s.

4:15 And it came to pass, when our enemies @) that it was known
unto us, and God had @ @ counsel to nought, that we returned
all of us to the wall, @ one unto his work.

4:16 And it came to pass from that time @, that the half of my
@<s wrought in the work, and the @C half of them held both the
spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers
were behind all the @ of @.

4:17 They @ builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
@J that laded, @ one with one of his @D wrought in the work,
and with the @C hand held a weapon.

4:18 For the builders, @ one had his @Q girded by his side, and
so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

4:19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of
the @, The work is @ and large, and we are separated upon the
wall, one far from @F.

4:20 In what @' @fore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort
ye thither unto us: our God @ fight for us.

4:21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from
the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

4:22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the @, Let @ one
with his @< lodge within @ , that in the night they may be
a guard to us, and labour on the day.

4:23 So @" I, nor my @3, nor my @<s, nor the men of
the guard @ followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving
that @ one put them off for washing.

5:1 And @ was a @ cry of the @ and of @ wives @

@ @3 the Jews.

5:2 For @ were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
many: @fore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.

5:3 Some also @ were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
vineyards, and @s, that we @B buy corn, @ of the d@.

5:4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's
tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

5:5 Yet now our @R is as the @R of our @3, our @ as
@ @: and, lo, we @( into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be @<s, and some of our daughters are @ unto
bondage already: @" is it in our power to redeem them; for @C
men have our lands and vineyards.

5:6 And I was very angry when I @) @ cry and @ @5.

5:7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, @ one of his @X.
And I set a @ assembly @
 them.

5:8 And I said unto them, We @ our ability have redeemed our
@3 the Jews, @ were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even
sell your @3? or @ they be sold unto us? Then held they
@ @U, and @V no@7 to answer.

5:9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our God @ of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies?  5:10 I likewise, and my @3, and my @<s, @B
exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

5:11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, @ lands, @
vineyards, @ oliveyards, and @ @s, also the @/th part
of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of
them.

5:12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require no@7 of
them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I @, the @6s, and
took an oath of them, that they @# do @$ to this promise.

5:13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out @ man from
his @, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even
thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the @` said,
Amen, and praised the LORD. And the @ did @$ to this
promise.

5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be @ governor
in the land of @, from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve @8, I and my
@3 have not eaten the @d of the governor.

5:15 But the former governors that had been @	 me were chargeable
unto the @, and had taken of them @d and wine, beside forty
shekels of silver; yea, even @ @<s bare rule over the @:
but so did not I, @ of the fear of God.

5:16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, @" bought we
any land: and all my @<s were ga@d thither unto the work.

5:17 Moreover @ were at my table an @/ and fifty of the Jews
and rulers, beside @J that came unto us from @ the heathen that
are @+ us.

5:18 Now that @ was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the @d
of the governor, @ the bondage was heavy upon this @.

5:19 Think upon me, my God, for good, @$ to all that I have
done for this @.

6:1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, @) that I had builded the
wall, and that @ was no breach left @in; (though at that time
I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 6:2 That Sanballat and
Geshem sent unto me, @, Come, let us meet @? in some one of
the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.

6:3 And I sent messengers unto them, @, I am doing a @ work,
so that I cannot come down: why @# the work cease, whilst I leave
it, and come down to you?  6:4 Yet they sent unto me four times @
this sort; and I @> them @ the same manner.

6:5 Then sent Sanballat his @< unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in his hand; 6:6 Wherein was written, It is
reported @ the heathen, and Gashmu @
 it, that thou and the
Jews think to rebel: for @ cause thou buildest the wall, that thou
mayest be @ king, @$ to @ @5.

6:7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
@ , @, There is a king in @: and now @ it be
reported to the king @$ to @ @5. Come now @fore, and
let us take counsel @?.

6:8 Then I sent unto him, @, There are no such @ done as
thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of @ own @.

6:9 For they all made us afraid, @, Their @D @ be weakened
from the work, that it be not done. Now @fore, O God, strengthen
my @D.

6:10 Afterward I came unto the @ of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet
@? in the @ of God, within the temple, and let us shut the
doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the
night will they come to slay thee.

6:11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is @, that,
being as I am, @L go into the temple to save his life? I will not
go in.

6:12 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
pronounced this prophecy @
 me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him.

6:13 @N was he hired, that I @# be afraid, and do so, and
sin, and that they @B have matter for an evil report, that they
@B reproach me.

6:14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat @$ to @
@ works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the
prophets, that @L have put me in fear.

6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
Elul, in fifty and two days.

6:16 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies @) @of, and
all the heathen that were @+ us saw @ @, they were much
cast down in @ own eyes: for they perceived that this work was
wrought of our God.

6:17 Moreover in @J days the nobles of @ sent many letters unto
Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

6:18 For @ were many in @ sworn unto him, @ he was the
son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had
taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

6:19 Also they reported his good deeds @	 me, and uttered my @5
to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

7:1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
7:2 That I gave my @X Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
palace, charge over @ : for he was a faithful man, and feared
God above many.

7:3 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of @  be opened
until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the
doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of
@ , @ one in his watch, and @ one to be over @

his @.

7:4 Now the city was large and @: but the @ were few @in,

7:5 And my God put into mine @ to gather @? the nobles, and

9:11 And thou didst divide the sea @	 them, so that they went

9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in

9:18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy

9:22 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide

9:23 Their @ also multipliedst thou as the stars of @1, and

9:26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled @

testified @

9:27 @N thou deliveredst them into the hand of @ enemies,

9:28 But @ they had rest, they did evil @* @	 thee:

10:28 And the rest of the @, the @6s, the Levites, the

Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the @

11:23 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a

11:24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the @ of Zerah

11:25 And for the villages, with @ fields, some of the @ of

11:31 The @ also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and

11:36 And of the Levites were divisions in @, and in Benjamin.

12:1 Now @ are the @6s and the Levites that went up with
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

12:8 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, @,
and Mattaniah, @ was over the thanksgiving, he and his @3.

12:9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, @ @3, were over @

12:10 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
Eliashib begat Joiada, 12:11 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan
begat Jaddua.

12:12 And in the days of Joiakim were @6s, the chief of the
@s: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 12:13 Of Ezra,
Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 12:14 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of

Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 12:21 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of
Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

12:22 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
Jaddua, were recorded chief of the @s: also the @6s, to the
reign of Darius the Persian.

12:23 The sons of Levi, the chief of the @s, were written in the
book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of
Eliashib.

12:24 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
the son of Kadmiel, with @ @3 over @
 them, to praise
and to give thanks, @$ to the commandment of @ the man of
God, ward over @
 ward.

12:25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

12:26 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the
@6, the scribe.

12:27 And at the dedication of the wall of @  they sought the
Levites out of all @ @'s, to @( them to @ , to keep
the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with
singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

12:28 And the sons of the singers ga@d @T @?, both
out of the plain country round @+ @ , and from the villages
of Netophathi; 12:29 Also from the @ of Gilgal, and out of the
fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages
round @+ @ .

12:30 And the @6s and the Levites purified @T, and
purified the @, and the gates, and the wall.

12:31 Then I @ up the princes of @ upon the wall, and
appointed two @ companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one
went on the @c hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 12:32 And
@ them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of @, 12:33 And
Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 12:34 @, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah,
and Jeremiah, 12:35 And certain of the @6s' sons with trumpets;
namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
12:36 And his @3, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
Nethaneel, and @, Hanani, with the musical instruments of @
the man of God, and Ezra the scribe @	 them.

12:37 And at the fountain gate, @ was over @
 them, they went
up by the stairs of the city of @, at the going up of the wall,
above the @ of @, even unto the @Z gate eastward.

12:38 And the @C company of them that gave thanks went over @

them, and I @ them, and the half of the @ upon the wall, from
beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 12:39 And
from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the
fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto
the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.

12:40 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the @
of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 12:41 And the
@6s; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
and Hananiah, with trumpets; 12:42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and
Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.
And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah @ overseer.

12:43 Also that day they offered @ sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
God had made them rejoice with @ joy: the wives also and the
@ rejoiced: so that the joy of @  was @) even afar
off.

12:44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
treasures, for the @&s, for the @Ofruits, and for the tithes,
to gather into them out of the fields of the @G the portions of
the law for the @6s and Levites: for @ rejoiced for the
@6s and for the Levites that waited.

12:45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of @ God,
and the ward of the purification, @$ to the commandment of
@, and of Solomon his son.

12:46 For in the days of @ and Asaph of old @ were chief of
the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

12:47 And all @ in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, @ day
his portion: and they sanctified holy @ unto the Levites; and the
Levites sanctified them unto the @ of Aaron.

13:1 On that day they read in the book of @ in the audience of the
@; and @in was @V written, that the Ammonite and the
Moabite @# not come into the @` of God for ever; 13:2
Because they met not the @ of @ with @d and with @Z,
but hired Balaam @
 them, that he @# curse them: howbeit our
God turned the curse into a blessing.

13:3 Now it came to pass, when they had @) the law, that they
separated from @ all the mixed multitude.

13:4 And @	 this, Eliashib the @6, having the oversight of the
chamber of the @ of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: 13:5 And he
had prepared for him a @ chamber, where aforetime they laid the
meat @&s, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of
the corn, the new wine, and the oil, @ was @M to be @=
to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the @&s of
the @6s.

13:6 But in all this time was not I at @ : for in the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and
@ certain days obtained I leave of the king: 13:7 And I came to
@ , and @[stood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the @ of God.

13:8 And it grieved me sore: @fore I cast @ all the @hold
stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

13:9 Then I @M, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
@ I @* the vessels of the @ of God, with the meat
@& and the frankincense.

13:10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
@= them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were
fled @ one to his field.

13:11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the @ of
God forsaken? And I ga@d them @?, and set them in @
@'.

13:12 Then @ all @ the tithe of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the treasuries.

13:13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the @6,
and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them
was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were
counted faithful, and @ office was to distribute unto @
@3.

13:14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
deeds that I have done for the @ of my God, and for the offices
@of.

13:15 In @J days saw I in @ some treading wine presses on the
sabbath, and @(ing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine,
grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, @ they @ into
@  on the sabbath day: and I testified @
 them in the day
wherein they sold victuals.

13:16 There dwelt men of Tyre also @in, @ @ fish, and
all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the @ of
@, and in @ .

13:17 Then I contended with the nobles of @, and said unto them,
What evil @7 is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
13:18 Did not your @s thus, and did not our God @( all this
evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye @( more wrath upon @
by profaning the sabbath.

13:19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of @  began to
be dark @	 the sabbath, I @M that the gates @# be shut,
and charged that they @# not be opened till @ the sabbath: and
some of my @<s set I at the gates, that @ @# no burden be
@ in on the sabbath day.

13:20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged @S
@  once or twice.

13:21 Then I testified @
 them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
@+ the wall? if ye do so @*, I will lay @D on you. From that
time @ came they no more on the sabbath.

13:22 And I @M the Levites that they @# cleanse @T,
and that they @# come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath
day.

Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me @$ to
the @ness of thy mercy.

13:23 In @J days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod,
of Ammon, and of Moab: 13:24 And @ @ @0 half in the
speech of Ashdod, and could not @K in the Jews' language, but
@$ to the language of each @.

13:25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
them, and plucked off @ hair, and made them swear by God, @,
Ye @ not give your daughters unto @ sons, nor take @
daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

13:26 Did not Solomon king of @ sin by @ @? yet @
many nations was @ no king like him, who was beloved of his God,
and God made him king over all @: nevertheless even him did
outlandish women cause to sin.

13:27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this @ evil, to
transgress @
 our God in marrying strange wives?  13:28 And one
of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high @6, was son in
law to Sanballat the Horonite: @fore I chased him from me.

13:29 Remember them, O my God, @ they have defiled the
@6hood, and the covenant of the @6hood, and of the Levites.

13:30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards
of the @6s and the Levites, @ one in his business; 13:31 And
for the wood @&, at times appointed, and for the @Ofruits.
Remember me, O my God, for good.




The Book of Esther


1:1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus
@ reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an @/ and
@H and twenty provinces:) 1:2 That in @J days, when the king
Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, @ was in Shushan the
palace, 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all
his princes and his @<s; the power of Persia and Media, the
nobles and princes of the provinces, being @	 him: 1:4 When he
shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his
excellent majesty many days, even an @/ and fourscore days.

1:5 And when @ days were expired, the king made a feast unto all
the @ that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto @
and small, @H days, in the court of the garden of the king's
palace; 1:6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble:
the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue,
and white, and black, marble.

1:7 And they gave them @b in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
diverse one from @F,) and royal wine in abundance, @$ to
the state of the king.

1:8 And the @bing was @$ to the law; none did compel: for so
the king had appointed to all the officers of his @, that they
@# do @$ to @ man's pleasure.

1:9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
@ @ belonged to king Ahasuerus.

1:10 On the @Hth day, when the @ of the king was merry with
wine, he @M Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,
Zethar, and Carcas, the @H chamberlains that served in the presence
of Ahasuerus the king, 1:11 To @( Vashti the queen @	 the king
with the crown royal, to shew the @ and the princes her beauty:
for she was fair to look on.

1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by
his chamberlains: @fore was the king very wroth, and his anger
burned in him.

1:13 Then the king said to the wise men, @ knew the times, (for so
was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 1:14 And
the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,
Marsena, and Memucan, the @H princes of Persia and Media, @ saw
the king's face, and @ sat the @O in the kingdom;) 1:15 What
@ we do unto the queen Vashti @$ to law, @ she hath
not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the
chamberlains?  1:16 And Memucan @> @	 the king and the
princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but
also to all the princes, and to all the @ that are in all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

1:17 For this deed of the queen @ come abroad unto all women, so
that they @ despise @ husbands in @ eyes, when it @ be
reported, The king Ahasuerus @M Vashti the queen to be @
in @	 him, but she came not.

1:18 Likewise @ the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto
all the king's princes, @ have @) of the deed of the queen.
Thus @ @ arise too much contempt and wrath.

1:19 If it please the king, let @ go a royal commandment from him,
and let it be written @ the laws of the Persians and the Medes,
that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more @	 king
Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto @F that is
better than she.

1:20 And when the king's decree @ he @ make @ be published
@Eout all his empire, (for it is @,) all the wives @ give
to @ husbands honour, both to @ and small.

1:21 And the @ pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
@$ to the word of Memucan: 1:22 For he sent letters into all
the king's provinces, into @ province @$ to the writing
@of, and to @ @ @ @ language, that @ man
@# bear rule in his own @, and that it @# be published
@$ to the language of @ @.

2:1 After @ @, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,
he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed
@
 her.

2:2 Then said the king's @<s that ministered unto him, Let @
be fair young virgins sought for the king: 2:3 And let the king
appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may
gather @? all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to
the @ of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's
chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let @ @ for
purification be @= them: 2:4 And let the maiden @ pleaseth the
king be queen instead of Vashti.

And the @7 pleased the king; and he did so.

2:5 Now in Shushan the palace @ was a certain Jew, whose name was
Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
Benjamite; 2:6 Who had been carried away from @  with the
captivity @ had been carried away with Jeconiah king of @,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

2:7 And he @ up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter:
for she had @" @ nor m@C, and the maid was fair and
beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her @ and m@C were dead, took
for his own daughter.

2:8 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was
@), and when many maidens were ga@d @? unto Shushan the
palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was @ also unto the
king's @, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.

2:9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and
he speedily gave her her @ for purification, with such @ as
belonged to her, and @H maidens, @ were meet to be @= her,
out of the king's @: and he preferred her and her maids unto the
best @' of the @ of the women.

2:10 Esther had not shewed her @ nor her kindred: for Mordecai
had charged her that she @# not shew it.

2:11 And Mordecai walked @ day @	 the court of the women's
@, to know how Esther did, and what @# become of her.

2:12 Now when @ maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
@ that she had been twelve months, @$ to the manner of the
women, (for so were the days of @ purifications accomplished, to
wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours,
and with @C @ for the purifying of the women;) 2:13 Then thus
came @ maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was @= her
to go with her out of the @ of the women unto the king's @.

2:14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
second @ of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's
chamberlain, @ kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no
more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were @, by
name.

2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto
the king, she required no@7 but what Hegai the king's chamberlain,
the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the
sight of all them that looked upon her.

2:16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his @ royal in
the tenth month, @ is the month Tebeth, in the @Hth year of his
reign.

2:17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he
set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of
Vashti.

2:18 Then the king made a @ feast unto all his princes and his
@<s, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces,
and gave gifts, @$ to the state of the king.

2:19 And when the virgins were ga@d @? the second time, then
Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

2:20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her @; as Mordecai
had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as
when she was @ up with him.

2:21 In @J days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the
king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of @J @ kept the door,
were wroth, and sought to lay @D on the king Ahasuerus.

2:22 And the @7 was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
queen; and Esther certified the king @of in Mordecai's name.

2:23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was @V out;
@fore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the
book of the chronicles @	 the king.

3:1 After @ @ did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all
the princes that were with him.

3:2 And all the king's @<s, that were in the king's gate, bowed,
and reverenced Haman: for the king had so @M concerning him.
But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

3:3 Then the king's @<s, @ were in the king's gate, said unto
Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?  3:4 Now it
came to pass, when they @0 daily unto him, and he hearkened not
unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters
@L stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.

3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
then was Haman full of wrath.

3:6 And he thought scorn to lay @D on Mordecai alone; for they had
shewed him the @ of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy
all the Jews that were @Eout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even
the @ of Mordecai.

3:7 In the @O month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year
of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, @	 Haman from
day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is,
the month Adar.

3:8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain @
scattered abroad and dispersed @ the @ in all the provinces
of thy kingdom; and @ laws are diverse from all @; @"
keep they the king's laws: @fore it is not for the king's profit
to suffer them.

3:9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
destroyed: and I will pay ten @: talents of silver to the @D
of @J that have the charge of the business, to @( it into the
king's treasuries.

3:10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman
the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

3:11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is @= to thee, the
@ also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

3:12 Then were the king's scribes @, on the thirteenth day of the
@O month, and @ was written @$ to all that Haman had
@M unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were
over @ province, and to the rulers of @ @ of @
province @$ to the writing @of, and to @ @ @
@ language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and
sealed with the king's ring.

3:13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces,
to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and
old, little @ and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth
day of the twelfth month, @ is the month Adar, and to take the
spoil of them for a prey.

3:14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be @= in @
province was published unto all @, that they @# be ready
@
 that day.

3:15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and
the decree was @= in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat
down to @b; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

4:1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the @a
of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 4:2 And came even
@	 the king's gate: for none @B enter into the king's gate
clothed with sackcloth.

4:3 And in @ province, whithersoever the king's commandment and
his decree came, @ was @ mourning @ the Jews, and fasting,
and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

4:4 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then
was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe
Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it
not.

4:5 Then @, Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment
to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

4:6 So Hatach went @ to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
@ was @	 the king's gate.

4:7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of
the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's
treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

4:8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
@= at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to
declare it unto her, and to charge her that she @# go in unto the
king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request @	 him
for her @.

4:9 And Hatach came and told Esther the @5 of Mordecai.

4:10 Again Esther @0 unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
Mordecai; 4:11 All the king's @<s, and the @ of the king's
provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, @ come
unto the king into the inner court, who is not @,, @ is one
law of his to put him to @^, except such to whom the king @
hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been
@, to come in unto the king @ thirty days.

4:12 And they told to Mordecai Esther's @5.

4:13 Then Mordecai @M to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
that thou @ escape in the king's @, more than all the Jews.

4:14 For if thou al@? holdest thy @U at this time, then @
@ enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from @F
@'; but thou and thy @'s @ @ be destroyed: and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
4:15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16 Go,
gather @? all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye
for me, and @" eat nor @b @@ days, night or day: I also and
my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,
@ is not @$ to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

4:17 So Mordecai went his way, and did @$ to all that Esther
had @M him.

5:1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's @, over
@
 the king's @: and the king sat upon his royal throne in
the royal @, over @
 the gate of the @.

5:2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to
Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near,
and touched the top of the sceptre.

5:3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
what is thy request? it @ be even @= thee to the half of the
kingdom.

5:4 And Esther @>, If it seem good unto the king, let the king
and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.

5:5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that
Esther had prepared.

5:6 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
petition? and it @ be granted thee: and what is thy request? even
to the half of the kingdom it @ be performed.

5:7 Then @> Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 5:8
If I have @V favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the
king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and
Haman come to the banquet that I @ prepare for them, and I will do
to morrow as the king hath said.

5:9 Then went Haman @ that day joyful and with a glad @: but
when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor
moved for him, he was full of indignation @
 Mordecai.

5:10 Nevertheless Haman refrained @9: and when he came home, he
sent and @, for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

5:11 And Haman told them of the @Y of his riches, and the multitude
of his @, and all the @ wherein the king had promoted him,
and how he had advanced him above the princes and @<s of the
king.

5:12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in
with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and
to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.

5:13 Yet all this availeth me no@7, so long as I see Mordecai the
Jew sitting at the king's gate.

5:14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow @K thou unto
the king that Mordecai may be hanged @on: then go thou in merrily
with the king unto the banquet. And the @7 pleased Haman; and he
caused the gallows to be made.

6:1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he @M to @(
the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read @	 the
king.

6:2 And it was @V written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who
sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

6:3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
Mordecai for this? Then said the king's @<s that ministered unto
him, There is no@7 done for him.

6:4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into
the outward court of the king's @, to @K unto the king to hang
Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.

6:5 And the king's @<s said unto him, @., Haman standeth in
the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

6:6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What @ be done
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in
his @, To whom @L the king delight to do honour more than to
myself?  6:7 And Haman @> the king, For the man whom the king
delighteth to honour, 6:8 Let the royal apparel be @ @ the
king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the
crown royal @ is set upon his head: 6:9 And let this apparel and
horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble
princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth
to honour, and @( him on horseback @E the street of the city,
and proclaim @	 him, Thus @ it be done to the man whom the
king delighteth to honour.

6:10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that
sitteth at the king's gate: let no@7 fail of all that thou hast
spoken.

6:11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
and @ him on horseback @E the street of the city, and
proclaimed @	 him, Thus @ it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth to honour.

6:12 And Mordecai came @* to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to
his @ mourning, and having his head covered.

6:13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends @ @7
that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto
him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, @	 whom thou hast
begun to fall, thou @ not prevail @
 him, but @ surely
fall @	 him.

6:14 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
chamberlains, and hasted to @( Haman unto the banquet that Esther
had prepared.

7:1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

7:2 And the king said @* unto Esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it @ be
granted thee: and what is thy request? and it @ be performed, even
to the half of the kingdom.

7:3 Then Esther the queen @> and said, If I have @V favour in
thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be @= me
at my petition, and my @ at my request: 7:4 For we are sold, I
and my @, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue,
although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.

7:5 Then the king Ahasuerus @> and said unto Esther the queen,
Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his @ to do so?
7:6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
Then Haman was afraid @	 the king and the queen.

7:7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his
life to Esther the queen; for he saw that @ was evil determined
@
 him by the king.

7:8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the @' of
the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther
was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also @	 me in the
@? As the word went out of king's @P, they covered Haman's
face.

7:9 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said @	 the king,
@. also, the gallows fifty cubits high, @ Haman had made for
Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the @ of
Haman. Then the king said, Hang him @on.

7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

8:1 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the @ of Haman the
Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came @	 the king;
for Esther had told what he was unto her.

8:2 And the king took off his ring, @ he had taken from Haman, and
gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the @ of
Haman.

8:3 And Esther @0 yet @* @	 the king, and fell down at his
feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman
the Agagite, and his device that he had devised @
 the Jews.

8:4 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
arose, and stood @	 the king, 8:5 And said, If it please the king,
and if I have favour in his sight, and the @7 seem @c @	 the
king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the
letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, @ he
wrote to destroy the Jews @ are in all the king's provinces: 8:6
For how can I endure to see the evil that @ come unto my @?
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?  8:7 Then
the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew,
@., I have @= Esther the @ of Haman, and him they have
hanged upon the gallows, @ he laid his hand upon the Jews.

8:8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name,
and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing @ is written in
the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.

8:9 Then were the king's scribes @, at that time in the third
month, that is, the month Sivan, on the @@ and twentieth day
@of; and it was written @$ to all that Mordecai @M
unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of
the provinces @ are from India unto Ethiopia, an @/ twenty
and @H provinces, unto @ province @$ to the writing
@of, and unto @ @ @ @ language, and to the Jews
@$ to @ writing, and @$ to @ language.

8:10 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the
king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on
mules, camels, and young dromedaries: 8:11 Wherein the king granted
the Jews @ were in @ city to gather @T @?, and
to stand for @ life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish,
all the power of the @ and province that @L assault them, both
little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 8:12
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, @ is the month Adar.

8:13 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be @= in @
province was published unto all @, and that the Jews @# be
ready @
 that day to avenge @T on @ enemies.

8:14 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was
@= at Shushan the palace.

8:15 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white, and with a @ crown of gold, and with a
garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and
was glad.

8:16 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

8:17 And in @ province, and in @ city, whithersoever the
king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,
a feast and a good day. And many of the @ of the land became
Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

9:1 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree
drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the
Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the
contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 9:2 The
Jews ga@d @T @? in @ @G @Eout all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought @
hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon
all @.

9:3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; @ the fear
of Mordecai fell upon them.

9:4 For Mordecai was @ in the king's @, and his fame went out
@Eout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed @er and
@er.

9:5 Thus the Jews smote all @ enemies with the stroke of the
@Q, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they @L unto
@J that hated them.

9:6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five @/
men.

9:7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 9:8 And Poratha, and
Adalia, and Aridatha, 9:9 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and
Vajezatha, 9:10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy
of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not @ hand.

9:11 On that day the number of @J that were slain in Shushan the
palace was @ @	 the king.

9:12 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
destroyed five @/ men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of
Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now
what is thy petition? and it @ be granted thee: or what is thy
request further? and it @ be done.

9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
Jews @ are in Shushan to do to morrow also @$ unto this
day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.

9:14 And the king @M it so to be done: and the decree was @=
at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

9:15 For the Jews that were in Shushan ga@d @T @? on
the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew @@ @/ men
at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not @ hand.

9:16 But the @C Jews that were in the king's provinces ga@d
@T @?, and stood for @ lives, and had rest from
@ enemies, and slew of @ foes @Hty and five @:, but
they laid not @ @D on the prey, 9:17 On the thirteenth day of
the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and
made it a day of feasting and gladness.

9:18 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled @? on the
thirteenth day @of, and on the fourteenth @of; and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting
and gladness.

9:19 @N the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to @F.

9:20 And Mordecai wrote @ @, and sent letters unto all the
Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh
and far, 9:21 To stablish this @ them, that they @# keep the
fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same,
yearly, 9:22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from @ enemies,
and the month @ was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from
mourning into a good day: that they @# make them days of feasting
and joy, and of sending portions one to @F, and gifts to the
poor.

9:23 And the Jews @[took to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai
had written unto them; 9:24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the
Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised @
 the Jews to
destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and
to destroy them; 9:25 But when Esther came @	 the king, he
@M by letters that his wicked device, @ he devised @

the Jews, @# return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
@# be hanged on the gallows.

9:26 Wherefore they @, @ days Purim @ the name of Pur.

@N for all the @5 of this letter, and of that @ they had
seen concerning this matter, and @ had come unto them, 9:27 The
Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon @ seed, and upon all
such as joined @T unto them, so as it @# not fail, that
they @L keep @ two days @$ to @ writing, and
@$ to @ appointed time @ year; 9:28 And that @ days
@# be remembered and kept @Eout @ generation, @
family, @ province, and @ city; and that @ days of Purim
@# not fail from @ the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish
from @ seed.

9:29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the
Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.

9:30 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the @/ twenty
and @H provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with @5 of @U
and truth, 9:31 To confirm @ days of Purim in @ times
appointed, @$ as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
enjoined them, and as they had decreed for @T and for @
seed, the matters of the fastings and @ cry.

9:32 And the decree of Esther confirmed @ matters of Purim; and it
was written in the book.

10:1 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
isles of the sea.

10:2 And all the acts of his power and of his @B, and the
declaration of the @ness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced
him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Media and Persia?  10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king
Ahasuerus, and @ @ the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of
his @3, seeking the wealth of his @, and @King @U to
all his seed.




The Book of Job


1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that
man was perfect and up@c, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

1:2 And @ were born unto him @H sons and @@ daughters.

1:3 His substance also was @H @: sheep, and @@ @:
camels, and five @/ yoke of oxen, and five @/ she asses, and
a very @ @hold; so that this man was the @est of all the
men of the east.

1:4 And his sons went and feasted in @ @s, @ one his day;
and sent and @, for @ @@ sisters to eat and to @b with
them.

1:5 And it was so, when the days of @ feasting were gone @+,
that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
and offered @_ @&s @$ to the number of them all: for
Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in @
@s. Thus did Job continually.

1:6 Now @ was a day when the sons of God came to present
@T @	 the LORD, and Satan came also @ them.

1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
@> the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the @, and
from walking up and down in it.

1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my @< Job,
that @ is none like him in the @, a perfect and an up@c
man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 Then Satan
@> the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast
not thou made an hedge @+ him, and @+ his @, and @+ all
that he hath on @ side? thou hast blessed the work of his @D,
and his substance is increased in the land.

1:11 But put @ @ hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
will curse thee to thy face.

1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, @., all that he hath is in thy
power; only upon @9 put not @ @ hand. So Satan went @
from the presence of the LORD.

1:13 And @ was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
and @bing wine in @ eldest @X's @: 1:14 And @ came
a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses
feeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took
them away; yea, they have slain the @<s with the edge of the
@Q; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:16 While he was yet @King, @ came also @F, and said, The
fire of God is fallen from @1, and hath burned up the sheep, and
the @<s, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.

1:17 While he was yet @King, @ came also @F, and said, The
Chaldeans made out @@ bands, and fell upon the camels, and have
carried them away, yea, and slain the @<s with the edge of the
@Q; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:18 While he was yet @King, @ came also @F, and said, Thy
sons and thy daughters were eating and @bing wine in @ eldest
@X's @: 1:19 And, @%, @ came a @ wind from the
wilderness, and smote the four corners of the @, and it fell upon
the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.

1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I
out of my m@C's womb, and naked @ I return thither: the LORD
gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

2:1 Again @ was a day when the sons of God came to present
@T @	 the LORD, and Satan came also @ them to present
@9 @	 the LORD.

2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
@> the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the @, and
from walking up and down in it.

2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my @< Job,
that @ is none like him in the @, a perfect and an up@c
man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
fast his integrity, although thou movedst me @
 him, to destroy
him @S cause.

2:4 And Satan @> the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
that a man hath will he give for his life.

2:5 But put @ @ hand now, and touch his bone and his @R,
and he will curse thee to thy face.

2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, @., he is in @ hand; but
save his life.

2:7 So went Satan @ from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

2:8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape @9 withal; and he sat
down @ the ashes.

2:9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain @
integrity?  curse God, and die.

2:10 But he said unto her, Thou @Kest as one of the foolish women
@Keth. What? @ we receive good at the hand of God, and @ we
not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

2:11 Now when Job's @@ friends @) of all this evil that was come
upon him, they came @ one from his own @'; Eliphaz the
Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they
had made an appointment @? to come to mourn with him and to
comfort him.

2:12 And when they lifted up @ eyes afar off, and knew him not,
they lifted up @ @;, and wept; and they rent @ one his
mantle, and sprinkled dust upon @ heads toward @1.

2:13 So they sat down with him upon the ground @H days and @H
nights, and none @0 a word unto him: for they saw that his grief
was very @.

3:1 After this opened Job his @P, and cursed his day.

3:2 And Job @0, and said, 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was
born, and the night in @ it was said, There is a man child
conceived.

3:4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
@" let the light shine upon it.

3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of @^ stain it; let a cloud dwell
upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

3:6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of
the months.

3:7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful @; come @in.

3:8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up
@ mourning.

3:9 Let the stars of the twilight @of be dark; let it look for
light, but have none; @" let it see the dawning of the day: 3:10
Because it shut not up the doors of my m@C's womb, nor hid sorrow
from mine eyes.

3:11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
when I came out of the belly?  3:12 Why did the knees prevent me? or
why the breasts that I @# suck?  3:13 For now @# I have lain
still and been quiet, I @# have slept: then had I been at rest,
3:14 With kings and counsellors of the @, @ build desolate
@'s for @T; 3:15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled
@ @s with silver: 3:16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had
not been; as infants @ never saw light.

3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and @ the weary be at
rest.

3:18 There the prisoners rest @?; they hear not the @; of the
oppressor.

3:19 The small and @ are @; and the @< is free from his
master.

3:20 Wherefore is light @= to him that is in misery, and life unto
the bitter in soul; 3:21 Which long for @^, but it cometh not; and
dig for it more than for hid treasures; 3:22 Which rejoice
exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?  3:23 Why is
light @= to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
3:24 For my sighing cometh @	 I eat, and my roarings are poured
out like the @Zs.

3:25 For the @7 @ I @ly feared is come upon me, and that
@ I was afraid of is come unto me.

3:26 I was not in safety, @" had I rest, @" was I quiet; yet
trouble came.

4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite @> and said, 4:2 If we assay to
commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold @9
from @King?  4:3 @., thou hast instructed many, and thou hast
strengthened the weak @D.

4:4 Thy @5 have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
strengthened the feeble knees.

4:5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,
and thou art troubled.

4:6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
up@cness of thy ways?  4:7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever
perished, being innocent? or where were the @ceous cut off?  4:8
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap
the same.

4:9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
are they consumed.

4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the @; of the fierce lion, and
the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

4:11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
whelps are scattered abroad.

4:12 Now a @7 was secretly @ to me, and mine ear received a
little @of.

4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
falleth on men, 4:14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, @ made all
my bones to shake.

4:15 Then a spirit passed @	 my face; the hair of my @R stood
up: 4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form @of: an
image was @	 mine eyes, @ was silence, and I @) a @;,
@, 4:17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? @ a man be
more pure than his maker?  4:18 @., he put no trust in his
@<s; and his angels he charged with folly: 4:19 How much less in
them that dwell in @s of clay, whose @Vation is in the dust,
@ are crushed @	 the moth?  4:20 They are destroyed from
morning to evening: they perish for ever @S any regarding it.

4:21 Doth not @ excellency @ is in them go away? they die,
even @S wisdom.

5:1 Call now, if @ be any that will answer thee; and to @ of
the saints wilt thou turn?  5:2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and
envy slayeth the silly one.

5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
habitation.

5:4 His @ are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
gate, @" is @ any to deliver them.

5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
thorns, and the robber swalloweth up @ substance.

5:6 Although affliction cometh not @ of the dust, @" doth
trouble spring out of the ground; 5:7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as
the sparks fly upward.

5:8 I @L seek unto God, and unto God @L I commit my cause: 5:9
Which doeth @ @ and unsearchable; marvellous @ @S
number: 5:10 Who giveth rain upon the @, and sendeth @Zs upon
the fields: 5:11 To set up on high @J that be low; that @J @
mourn may be exalted to safety.

5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that @ @D
cannot perform @ enterprise.

5:13 He taketh the wise in @ own craftiness: and the counsel of
the froward is carried headlong.

5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday
as in the night.

5:15 But he saveth the poor from the @Q, from @ @P, and from
the hand of the @By.

5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her @P.

5:17 @., happy is the man whom God correcteth: @fore despise
not thou the chastening of the Al@By: 5:18 For he maketh sore, and
bindeth up: he woundeth, and his @D make whole.

5:19 He @ deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in @H @ @
no evil touch thee.

5:20 In famine he @ redeem thee from @^: and in war from the
power of the @Q.

5:21 Thou @ be hid from the scourge of the tongue: @" @
thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

5:22 At destruction and famine thou @ laugh: @" @ thou be
afraid of the beasts of the @.

5:23 For thou @ be in league with the stones of the field: and the
beasts of the field @ be at @U with thee.

5:24 And thou @ know that thy tabernacle @ be in @U; and
thou @ visit thy habitation, and @ not sin.

5:25 Thou @ know also that thy seed @ be @, and @
offspring as the grass of the @.

5:26 Thou @ come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season.

5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
for thy good.

6:1 But Job @> and said, 6:2 Oh that my grief were @Ely
weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances @?!  6:3 For now
it @L be heavier than the sand of the sea: @fore my @5 are
swallowed up.

6:4 For the arrows of the Al@By are within me, the poison whereof
@beth up my spirit: the terrors of God do set @T in array
@
 me.

6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
his fodder?  6:6 Can that @ is unsavoury be eaten @S salt? or
is @ any taste in the white of an egg?  6:7 The @ that my
soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.

6:8 Oh that I @B have my request; and that God @L grant me the
@7 that I long for!  6:9 Even that it @L please God to destroy
me; that he @L let loose his hand, and cut me off!  6:10 Then
@# I yet have comfort; yea, I @L harden myself in sorrow: let
him not spare; for I have not concealed the @5 of the Holy One.

6:11 What is my strength, that I @# hope? and what is mine end,
that I @# prolong my life?  6:12 Is my strength the strength of
stones? or is my @R of brass?  6:13 Is not my help in me? and is
wisdom driven quite from me?  6:14 To him that is afflicted pity
@# be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the
Al@By.

6:15 My @3 have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream
of brooks they pass away; 6:16 Which are blackish by reason of the
ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 6:17 What time they wax warm, they
vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of @ @'.

6:18 The paths of @ way are turned aside; they go to no@7, and
perish.

6:19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
them.

6:20 They were con@Ved @ they had hoped; they came thither,
and were ashamed.

6:21 For now ye are no@7; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.

6:22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
substance?  6:23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me
from the hand of the @By?  6:24 Teach me, and I will hold my
tongue: and cause me to @[stand wherein I have erred.

6:25 How forcible are @c @5! but what doth your arguing reprove?
6:26 Do ye imagine to reprove @5, and the speeches of one that is
desperate, @ are as wind?  6:27 Yea, ye overwhelm the @less,
and ye dig a pit for your friend.

6:28 Now @fore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
you if I lie.

6:29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return @*, my
@ceousness is in it.

6:30 Is @ iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
@?  7:1 Is @ not an appointed time to man upon @? are not
his days also like the days of an hireling?  7:2 As a @<
earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the
reward of his work: 7:3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and
wearisome nights are appointed to me.

7:4 When I lie down, I say, When @ I arise, and the night be gone?
and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

7:5 My @R is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
broken, and become loathsome.

7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent @S
hope.

7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye @ no more see good.

7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me @ see me no more: @ eyes
are upon me, and I am not.

7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
to the grave @ come up no more.

7:10 He @ return no more to his @, @" @ his @'
know him any more.

7:11 @N I will not refrain my @P; I will @K in the
anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?  7:13
When I say, My bed @ comfort me, my couch @ ease my
complaints; 7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me
@E visions: 7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and @^
rather than my life.

7:16 I loathe it; I @L not live alway: let me alone; for my days
are vanity.

7:17 What is man, that thou @#est magnify him? and that thou
@#est set @ @ upon him?  7:18 And that thou @#est
visit him @ morning, and try him @ moment?  7:19 How long wilt
thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my
spittle?  7:20 I have sinned; what @ I do unto thee, O thou
preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark @
 thee, so
that I am a burden to myself?  7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my
transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now @ I sleep in the
dust; and thou @ seek me in the morning, but I @ not be.

8:1 Then @> Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou
@K @ @? and how long @ the @5 of thy @P be like
a strong wind?  8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Al@By
pervert justice?  8:4 If thy @ have sinned @
 him, and he
have cast them away for @ transgression; 8:5 If thou @Lest seek
unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Al@By; 8:6 If
thou wert pure and up@c; surely now he @L awake for thee, and
make the habitation of thy @ceousness prosperous.

8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end @# @ly
increase.

8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself
to the search of @ @s: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and
know no@7, @ our days upon @ are a shadow:) 8:10 Shall
not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter @5 out of @
@?  8:11 Can the rush grow up @S mire? can the flag grow
@S @Z?  8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut
down, it wi@th @	 any @C herb.

8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope
@ perish: 8:14 Whose hope @ be cut off, and whose trust @
be a spider's web.

8:15 He @ lean upon his @, but it @ not stand: he @
hold it fast, but it @ not endure.

8:16 He is green @	 the sun, and his branch shooteth @ in his

8:17 His roots are wrapped @+ the heap, and seeth the @' of
stones.

8:18 If he destroy him from his @', then it @ deny him, @,
I have not seen thee.

8:19 @., this is the joy of his way, and out of the @ @
@Cs grow.

8:20 @., God will not cast away a perfect man, @" will he
help the evil doers: 8:21 Till he fill thy @P with laughing, and
thy lips with rejoicing.

8:22 They that hate thee @ be clothed with shame; and the dwelling
@' of the wicked @ come to nought.

9:1 Then Job @> and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but
how @# man be just with God?  9:3 If he will contend with him, he
cannot answer him one of a @:.

9:4 He is wise in @, and @By in strength: who hath hardened
@9 @
 him, and hath prospered?  9:5 Which removeth the
mountains, and they know not: @ overturneth them in his anger.

9:6 Which shaketh the @ out of her @', and the pillars @of
tremble.

9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
stars.

9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the @1s, and treadeth upon the waves
of the sea.

9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of
the south.

9:10 Which doeth @ @ past finding out; yea, and wonders
@S number.

9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
perceive him not.

9:12 @., he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
him, What doest thou?  9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the
proud helpers do stoop @[ him.

9:14 How much less @ I answer him, and choose out my @5 to
reason with him?  9:15 Whom, though I were @ceous, yet @L I not
answer, but I @L make supplication to my judge.

9:16 If I had @,, and he had @> me; yet @L I not believe
that he had hearkened unto my @;.

9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
@S cause.

9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
bitterness.

9:19 If I @K of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
@ set me a time to plead?  9:20 If I justify myself, mine own
@P @ condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it @ also prove me
perverse.

9:21 Though I were perfect, yet @L I not know my soul: I @L
despise my life.

9:22 This is one @7, @fore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect
and the wicked.

9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
innocent.

9:24 The @ is @= into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
faces of the judges @of; if not, where, and who is he?  9:25 Now
my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.

9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
hasteth to the prey.

9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
heaviness, and comfort myself: 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I
know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.

9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  9:30 If I wash myself
with snow @Z, and make my @D never so clean; 9:31 Yet @ thou
plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes @ abhor me.

9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I @# answer him, and we
@# come @? in judgment.

9:33 Neither is @ any daysman betwixt us, that @B lay his hand
upon us both.

9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify
me: 9:35 Then @L I @K, and not fear him; but it is not so with
me.

10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
myself; I will @K in the bitterness of my soul.

10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
contendest with me.

10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou @#est oppress, that thou
@#est despise the work of @ @D, and shine upon the counsel
of the wicked?  10:4 Hast thou eyes of @R? or seest thou as man
seeth?  10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy @8 as man's
days, 10:6 That thou enquirest @ mine iniquity, and searchest
@ my sin?  10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and @ is
none that can deliver out of @ hand.

10:8 Thine @D have made me and fashioned me @? round @+;
yet thou dost destroy me.

10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
wilt thou @( me into dust @*?  10:10 Hast thou not poured me out
as milk, and curdled me like cheese?  10:11 Thou hast clothed me with
skin and @R, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.

10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
preserved my spirit.

10:13 And @ @ hast thou hid in @ @: I know that this
is with thee.

10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
mine iniquity.

10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be @ceous, yet will I
not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; @fore see thou mine
affliction; 10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:
and @* thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses @
 me, and increasest @
indignation upon me; changes and war are @
 me.

10:18 Wherefore then hast thou @ me @ out of the womb? Oh
that I had @= up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  10:19 I @#
have been as though I had not been; I @# have been carried from
the womb to the grave.

10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
take comfort a little, 10:21 Before I go whence I @ not return,
even to the land of darkness and the shadow of @^; 10:22 A land of
darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of @^, @S any
order, and where the light is as darkness.

11:1 Then @> Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not
the multitude of @5 be @>? and @# a man full of talk be
justified?  11:3 Should thy lies make men hold @ @U? and when
thou mockest, @ no man make thee ashamed?  11:4 For thou hast
said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in @ eyes.

11:5 But oh that God @L @K, and open his lips @
 thee; 11:6
And that he @L shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are
double to that @ is! Know @fore that God exacteth of thee less
than @ iniquity deserveth.

11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
Al@By unto perfection?  11:8 It is as high as @1; what canst
thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?  11:9 The measure
@of is longer than the @, and broader than the sea.

11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather @?, then who can
hinder him?  11:11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also;
will he not then consider it?  11:12 For vain men @L be wise,
though man be born like a wild ass's colt.

11:13 If thou prepare @ @, and stretch out @ @D toward
him; 11:14 If iniquity be in @ hand, put it far away, and let not
wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

11:15 For then @ thou lift up thy face @S spot; yea, thou
@ be stedfast, and @ not fear: 11:16 Because thou @ forget
thy misery, and remember it as @Zs that pass away: 11:17 And @
age @ be clearer than the noonday: thou @ shine @, thou
@ be as the morning.

11:18 And thou @ be secure, @ @ is hope; yea, thou @
dig @+ thee, and thou @ take thy rest in safety.

11:19 Also thou @ lie down, and none @ make thee afraid; yea,
many @ make suit unto thee.

11:20 But the eyes of the wicked @ fail, and they @ not
escape, and @ hope @ be as the giving up of the ghost.

12:1 And Job @> and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the @,
and wisdom @ die with you.

12:3 But I have @[standing as well as you; I am not inferior to
you: yea, who knoweth not such @ as @?  12:4 I am as one
mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:
the just up@c man is laughed to scorn.

12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in
the thought of him that is at ease.

12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
secure; into whose hand God @(eth abundantly.

12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they @ teach thee; and the fowls
of the air, and they @ tell thee: 12:8 Or @K to the @, and
it @ teach thee: and the fishes of the sea @ declare unto
thee.

12:9 Who knoweth not in all @ that the hand of the LORD hath
wrought this?  12:10 In whose hand is the soul of @ living @7,
and the breath of all mankind.

12:11 Doth not the ear try @5? and the @P taste his meat?  12:12
With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days @[standing.

12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
@[standing.

12:14 @., he breaketh down, and it cannot be built @*: he
shutteth up a man, and @ can be no opening.

12:15 @., he withholdeth the @Zs, and they dry up: also he
sendeth them out, and they overturn the @.

12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
are his.

12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
fools.

12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth @ loins with a
girdle.

12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the @By.

12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
@[standing of the aged.

12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of
the @By.

12:22 He discovereth deep @ out of darkness, and @(eth out to
light the shadow of @^.

12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
nations, and straiteneth them @*.

12:24 He taketh away the @ of the chief of the @ of the
@, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where @ is no
way.

12:25 They grope in the dark @S light, and he maketh them to
stagger like a drunken man.

13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath @) and
@[stood it.

13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
you.

13:3 Surely I @L @K to the Al@By, and I desire to reason with
God.

13:4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

13:5 O that ye @L al@? hold your @U! and it @# be your
wisdom.

13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

13:7 Will ye @K wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?  13:9 Is it
good that he @# search you out? or as one man mocketh @F, do
ye so mock him?  13:10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly
accept persons.

13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
upon you?  13:12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to
bodies of clay.

13:13 Hold your @U, let me alone, that I may @K, and let come on
me what will.

13:14 Wherefore do I take my @R in my teeth, and put my life in
mine hand?  13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I
will maintain mine own ways @	 him.

13:16 He also @ be my salvation: for an hypocrite @ not come
@	 him.

13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

13:18 @. now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I @ be
justified.

13:19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,
I @ give up the ghost.

13:20 Only do not two @ unto me: then will I not hide myself from
thee.

13:21 Withdraw @ hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
afraid.

13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me @K, and answer
thou me.

13:23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
transgression and my sin.

13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for @ enemy?
13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
the dry stubble?  13:26 For thou writest bitter @ @
 me, and
makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.

13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

13:28 And he, as a rotten @7, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
eaten.

14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.

14:2 He cometh @ like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as
a shadow, and continueth not.

14:3 And doth thou open @ eyes upon such an one, and @(est me
into judgment with thee?  14:4 Who can @( a clean @7 out of an
unclean? not one.

14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 14:6 Turn
from him, that he may rest, till he @ accomplish, as an hireling,
his day.

14:7 For @ is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
sprout @*, and that the tender branch @of will not cease.

14:8 Though the root @of wax old in the @, and the stock
@of die in the ground; 14:9 Yet @E the scent of @Z it will
bud, and @( @ boughs like a plant.

14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
and where is he?  14:11 As the @Zs fail from the sea, and the flood
decayeth and drieth up: 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till
the @1s be no more, they @ not awake, nor be raised out of
@ sleep.

14:13 O that thou @Lest hide me in the grave, that thou @Lest
keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou @Lest appoint me
a set time, and remember me!  14:14 If a man die, @ he live @*?
all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

14:15 Thou @ call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire
to the work of @ @D.

14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
sin?  14:17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
mine iniquity.

14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock
is removed out of his @'.

14:19 The @Zs wear the stones: thou washest away the @ @
grow out of the dust of the @; and thou destroyest the hope of
man.

14:20 Thou prevailest for ever @
 him, and he passeth: thou
changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
@ low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

14:22 But his @R upon him @ have pain, and his soul within him
@ mourn.

15:1 Then @> Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise
man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?  15:3
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he
can do no good?  15:4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest
prayer @	 God.

15:5 For thy @P uttereth @ iniquity, and thou choosest the
tongue of the crafty.

15:6 Thine own @P condemneth thee, and not I: yea, @ own lips
testify @
 thee.

15:7 Art thou the @O man that was born? or wast thou made @	
the hills?  15:8 Hast thou @) the secret of God? and dost thou
restrain wisdom to thyself?  15:9 What knowest thou, that we know not?
what @[standest thou, @ is not in us?  15:10 With us are both
the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy @.

15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is @ any secret
@7 with thee?  15:12 Why doth @ @ carry thee away? and what
do thy eyes wink at, 15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit @
 God,
and lettest such @5 go out of thy @P?  15:14 What is man, that
he @# be clean? and he @ is born of a woman, that he @# be
@ceous?  15:15 @., he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the
@1s are not clean in his sight.

15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, @ @beth
iniquity like @Z?  15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that @
I have seen I will declare; 15:18 Which wise men have told from @
@s, and have not hid it: 15:19 Unto whom alone the @ was
@=, and no stranger passed @ them.

15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number
of @8 is hidden to the oppressor.

15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
@ come upon him.

15:22 He believeth not that he @ return out of darkness, and he is
waited for of the @Q.

15:23 He wandereth abroad for @d, @, Where is it? he knoweth
that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

15:24 Trouble and anguish @ make him afraid; they @ prevail
@
 him, as a king ready to the battle.

15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand @
 God, and strengtheneth
@9 @
 the Al@By.

15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of
his bucklers: 15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and
maketh collops of fat on his flanks.

15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate @G, and in @s @ no man
inhabiteth, @ are ready to become heaps.

15:29 He @ not be rich, @" @ his substance continue,
@" @ he prolong the perfection @of upon the @.

15:30 He @ not depart out of darkness; the flame @ dry up his
branches, and by the breath of his @P @ he go away.

15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity @
be his recompence.

15:32 It @ be accomplished @	 his time, and his branch @
not be green.

15:33 He @ shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and @ cast
off his flower as the olive.

15:34 For the @` of hypocrites @ be desolate, and fire
@ consume the tabernacles of bribery.

15:35 They conceive mischief, and @( @ vanity, and @ belly
prepareth deceit.

16:1 Then Job @> and said, 16:2 I have @) many such @:
miserable comforters are ye all.

16:3 Shall vain @5 have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest?  16:4 I also could @K as ye do: if your soul were in my
soul's stead, I could heap up @5 @
 you, and shake mine head
at you.

16:5 But I @L strengthen you with my @P, and the moving of my
lips @# asswage your grief.

16:6 Though I @K, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,
what am I eased?  16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made
desolate all my company.

16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, @ is a witness @

me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

16:10 They have gaped upon me with @ @P; they have smitten me
upon the cheek reproachfully; they have ga@d @T @?
@
 me.

16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
the @D of the wicked.

16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me as@[: he hath also taken
me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

16:13 His archers compass me round @+, he cleaveth my reins
as@[, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like
a giant.

16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the
dust.

16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of
@^; 16:17 Not for any injustice in mine @D: also my prayer is
pure.

16:18 O @, cover not thou my @I, and let my cry have no @'.

16:19 Also now, @%, my witness is in @1, and my record is on
high.

16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

16:21 O that one @B plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for
his neighbour!  16:22 When a few @8 are come, then I @ go the
way whence I @ not return.

17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready
for me.

17:2 Are @ not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in
@ provocation?  17:3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;
who is he that will strike @D with me?  17:4 For thou hast hid
@ @ from @[standing: @fore @ thou not exalt them.

17:5 He that @Keth flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
@ @ fail.

17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the @; and aforetime I was
as a tabret.

17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are
as a shadow.

17:8 Up@c men @ be astonied at this, and the innocent @
stir up @9 @
 the hypocrite.

17:9 The @ceous also @ hold on his way, and he that hath clean
@D @ be stronger and stronger.

17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
find one wise man @ you.

17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts
of my @.

17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short @ of
darkness.

17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine @: I have made my bed in the
darkness.

17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my @: to the worm, Thou
art my m@C, and my sister.

17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who @ see it?
17:16 They @ go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
@? is in the dust.

18:1 Then @> Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2 How long will it
be ere ye make an end of @5? mark, and @wards we will @K.

18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
sight?  18:4 He teareth @9 in his anger: @ the @ be
forsaken for thee? and @ the rock be removed out of his @'?
18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked @ be put out, and the spark of
his fire @ not shine.

18:6 The light @ be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle @
be put out with him.

18:7 The steps of his strength @ be straitened, and his own
counsel @ cast him down.

18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
snare.

18:9 The gin @ take him by the heel, and the robber @ prevail
@
 him.

18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
the way.

18:11 Terrors @ make him afraid on @ side, and @ drive him
to his feet.

18:12 His strength @ be hungerbitten, and destruction @ be
ready at his side.

18:13 It @ devour the strength of his skin: even the @Oborn of
@^ @ devour his strength.

18:14 His confidence @ be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
@ @( him to the king of terrors.

18:15 It @ dwell in his tabernacle, @ it is none of his:
brimstone @ be scattered upon his habitation.

18:16 His roots @ be dried up beneath, and above @ his branch
be cut off.

18:17 His remembrance @ perish from the @, and he @ have
no name in the street.

18:18 He @ be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
the world.

18:19 He @ @" have son nor nephew @ his @, nor any
remaining in his dwellings.

18:20 They that come @ him @ be astonied at his day, as they
that went @	 were aff@ced.

18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
@' of him that knoweth not God.

19:1 Then Job @> and said, 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,
and break me in pieces with @5?  19:3 These ten times have ye
reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to
me.

19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
myself.

19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves @
 me, and plead
@
 me my reproach: 19:6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and
hath compassed me with his net.

19:7 @., I cry out of wrong, but I am not @): I cry aloud, but
@ is no judgment.

19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
darkness in my paths.

19:9 He hath stripped me of my @Y, and taken the crown from my
head.

19:10 He hath destroyed me on @ side, and I am gone: and mine hope
hath he removed like a tree.

19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath @
 me, and he counteth me
unto him as one of his enemies.

19:12 His troops come @?, and raise up @ way @
 me, and
encamp round @+ my tabernacle.

19:13 He hath put my @3 far from me, and mine acquaintance are
verily estranged from me.

19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten
me.

19:15 They that dwell in mine @, and my maids, count me for a
stranger: I am an alien in @ sight.

19:16 I @, my @<, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
with my @P.

19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
@'s sake of mine own body.

19:18 Yea, young @ despised me; I arose, and they @0 @

me.

19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
turned @
 me.

19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my @R, and I am escaped
with the skin of my teeth.

19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
hand of God hath touched me.

19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
@R?  19:23 Oh that my @5 were now written! oh that they were
printed in a book!  19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen and
lead in the rock for ever!  19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth,
and that he @ stand at the latter day upon the @: 19:26 And
though @ my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my @R @ I
see God: 19:27 Whom I @ see for myself, and mine eyes @
@%, and not @F; though my reins be consumed within me.

19:28 But ye @# say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the
matter is @V in me?  19:29 Be ye afraid of the @Q: for wrath
@(eth the punishments of the @Q, that ye may know @ is a
judgment.

20:1 Then @> Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 @N do
my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.

20:3 I have @) the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
@[standing causeth me to answer.

20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was @'d upon @,
20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment?  20:6 Though his excellency mount up to
the @1s, and his head reach unto the clouds; 20:7 Yet he @
perish for ever like his own dung: they @ have seen him @ say,
Where is he?  20:8 He @ fly away as a dream, and @ not be
@V: yea, he @ be chased away as a vision of the night.

20:9 The eye also @ saw him @ see him no more; @" @
his @' any more @% him.

20:10 His @ @ seek to please the poor, and his @D @
restore @ goods.

20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, @ @ lie down
with him in the dust.

20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his @P, though he hide it @[
his tongue; 20:13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it
still within his @P: 20:14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it
is the gall of asps within him.

20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he @ vomit them up @*:
God @ cast them out of his belly.

20:16 He @ suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue @ slay
him.

20:17 He @ not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
butter.

20:18 That @ he laboured for @ he restore, and @ not
swallow it down: @$ to his substance @ the restitution be,
and he @ not rejoice @in.

20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; @ he
hath violently taken away an @ @ he builded not; 20:20 Surely
he @ not feel quietness in his belly, he @ not save of that
@ he desired.

20:21 There @ none of his meat be left; @fore @ no man
look for his goods.

20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he @ be in straits: @
hand of the wicked @ come upon him.

20:23 When he is @+ to fill his belly, God @ cast the fury of
his wrath upon him, and @ rain it upon him while he is eating.

20:24 He @ flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel @
strike him @E.

20:25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
@Q cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

20:26 All darkness @ be hid in his secret @'s: a fire not blown
@ consume him; it @ go ill with him that is left in his
tabernacle.

20:27 The @1 @ reveal his iniquity; and the @ @ rise
up @
 him.

20:28 The increase of his @ @ depart, and his goods @ flow
away in the day of his wrath.

20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
appointed unto him by God.

21:1 But Job @> and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and
let this be your consolations.

21:3 Suffer me that I may @K; and @ that I have spoken, mock
on.

21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why @#
not my spirit be troubled?  21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay
your hand upon your @P.

21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
@R.

21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are @By in
power?  21:8 Their seed is established in @ sight with them, and
@ offspring @	 @ eyes.

21:9 Their @s are safe from fear, @" is the rod of God upon
them.

21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; @ cow calveth, and
casteth not her calf.

21:11 They send @ @ little ones like a flock, and @
@ dance.

21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the
organ.

21:13 They spend @ days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the
grave.

21:14 @N they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways.

21:15 What is the Al@By, that we @# serve him? and what profit
@# we have, if we pray unto him?  21:16 Lo, @ good is not in
@ hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh
@ destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.

21:18 They are as stubble @	 the wind, and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away.

21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his @: he rewardeth him,
and he @ know it.

21:20 His eyes @ see his destruction, and he @ @b of the
wrath of the Al@By.

21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his @ @ him, when the
number of his months is cut off in the @a?  21:22 Shall any teach
God knowledge? seeing he judgeth @J that are high.

21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
marrow.

21:25 And @F dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
eateth with pleasure.

21:26 They @ lie down alike in the dust, and the worms @ cover
them.

21:27 @., I know your thoughts, and the devices @ ye
wrongfully imagine @
 me.

21:28 For ye say, Where is the @ of the prince? and where are the
dwelling @'s of the wicked?  21:29 Have ye not asked them that go
by the way? and do ye not know @ tokens, 21:30 That the wicked is
reserved to the day of destruction? they @ be @ @ to the
day of wrath.

21:31 Who @ declare his way to his face? and who @ repay him
what he hath done?  21:32 Yet @ he be @ to the grave, and
@ remain in the tomb.

21:33 The clods of the valley @ be sweet unto him, and @ man
@ draw @ him, as @ are innumerable @	 him.

21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers @
remaineth falsehood?  22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite @> and
said, 22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
profitable unto @9?  22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Al@By,
that thou art @ceous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy
ways perfect?  22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he
enter with thee into judgment?  22:5 Is not thy wickedness @? and
@ iniquities infinite?  22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy
@X for nought, and stripped the naked of @ clo@7.

22:7 Thou hast not @= @Z to the weary to @b, and thou hast
withholden @d from the hungry.

22:8 But as for the @By man, he had the @; and the honourable
man dwelt in it.

22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the @less
have been broken.

22:10 @N snares are round @+ thee, and sudden fear troubleth
thee; 22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of
@Zs cover thee.

22:12 Is not God in the height of @1? and @% the height of the
stars, how high they are!  22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know?
can he judge @E the dark cloud?  22:14 Thick clouds are a
covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of
@1.

22:15 Hast thou marked the old way @ wicked men have trodden?
22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose @Vation was overflown
with a flood: 22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can
the Al@By do for them?  22:18 Yet he filled @ @s with good
@: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

22:19 The @ceous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them
to scorn.

22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
the fire consumeth.

22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at @U: @by good
@ come unto thee.

22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his @P, and lay up his
@5 in @ @.

22:23 If thou return to the Al@By, thou @ be built up, thou
@ put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

22:24 Then @ thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
the stones of the brooks.

22:25 Yea, the Al@By @ be thy defence, and thou @ have
plenty of silver.

22:26 For then @ thou have thy delight in the Al@By, and @
lift up thy face unto God.

22:27 Thou @ make thy prayer unto him, and he @ hear thee, and
thou @ pay thy vows.

22:28 Thou @ also decree a @7, and it @ be established unto
thee: and the light @ shine upon thy ways.

22:29 When men are cast down, then thou @ say, There is lifting
up; and he @ save the humble person.

22:30 He @ deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered
by the pureness of @ @D.

23:1 Then Job @> and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint
bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

23:3 Oh that I knew where I @B find him! that I @B come even to
his seat!  23:4 I @L order my cause @	 him, and fill my @P
with arguments.

23:5 I @L know the @5 @ he @L answer me, and @[stand
what he @L say unto me.

23:6 Will he plead @
 me with his @ power? No; but he @L
put strength in me.

23:7 There the @ceous @B dispute with him; so @# I be
delivered for ever from my judge.

23:8 @., I go forward, but he is not @; and backward, but I
cannot perceive him: 23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I
cannot @% him: he hideth @9 on the @c hand, that I cannot
see him: 23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried
me, I @ come @ as gold.

23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
declined.

23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
have esteemed the @5 of his @P more than my necessary food.

23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
desireth, even that he doeth.

23:14 For he performeth the @7 that is appointed for me: and many
such @ are with him.

23:15 @N am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
afraid of him.

23:16 For God maketh my @ soft, and the Al@By troubleth me:
23:17 Because I was not cut off @	 the darkness, @" hath he
covered the darkness from my face.

24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Al@By, do they that
know him not see his days?  24:2 Some remove the landmarks; they
violently take away flocks, and feed @of.

24:3 They drive away the ass of the @less, they take the widow's
ox for a pledge.

24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the @ hide
@T @?.

24:5 @., as wild asses in the desert, go they @ to @ work;
rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and
for @ @.

24:6 They reap @ one his corn in the field: and they gather the
vintage of the wicked.

24:7 They cause the naked to lodge @S clo@7, that they have no
covering in the cold.

24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the
rock for want of a shelter.

24:9 They pluck the @less from the breast, and take a pledge of
the poor.

24:10 They cause him to go naked @S clo@7, and they take away
the sheaf from the hungry; 24:11 Which make oil within @ walls,
and tread @ winepresses, and suffer thirst.

24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

24:13 They are of @J that rebel @
 the light; they know not
the ways @of, nor abide in the paths @of.

24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
and in the night is as a thief.

24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, @,
No eye @ see me: and disguiseth his face.

24:16 In the dark they dig @E @s, @ they had marked for
@T in the daytime: they know not the light.

24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of @^: if one
know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of @^.

24:18 He is swift as the @Zs; @ portion is cursed in the @:
he @%eth not the way of the vineyards.

24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow @Zs: so doth the grave
@J @ have sinned.

24:20 The womb @ forget him; the worm @ feed sweetly on him;
he @ be no more remembered; and wickedness @ be broken as a
tree.

24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
good to the widow.

24:22 He draweth also the @By with his power: he riseth up, and no
man is sure of life.

24:23 Though it be @= him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet
his eyes are upon @ ways.

24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and @
low; they are taken out of the way as all @C, and cut off as the
tops of the ears of corn.

24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
speech no@7 worth?  25:1 Then @> Bildad the Shuhite, and
said, 25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh @U in his high
@'s.

25:3 Is @ any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
light arise?  25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can
he be clean that is born of a woman?  25:5 @. even to the moon,
and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.

25:6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, @ is a
worm?  26:1 But Job @> and said, 26:2 How hast thou helped him
that is @S power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
thou plentifully declared the @7 as it is?  26:4 To whom hast thou
uttered @5? and whose spirit came from thee?  26:5 Dead @ are
formed from @[ the @Zs, and the inhabitants @of.

26:6 Hell is naked @	 him, and destruction hath no covering.

26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty @', and hangeth the
@ upon no@7.

26:8 He bindeth up the @Zs in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
not rent @[ them.

26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud
upon it.

26:10 He hath compassed the @Zs with bounds, until the day and
night come to an end.

26:11 The pillars of @1 tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his @[standing he
smiteth @E the proud.

26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the @1s; his hand hath
formed the crooked serpent.

26:14 Lo, @ are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
@) of him? but the th@[ of his power who can @[stand?  27:1
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 27:2 As God liveth, who
hath taken away my judgment; and the Al@By, who hath vexed my soul;
27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my
nostrils; 27:4 My lips @ not @K wickedness, nor my tongue utter
deceit.

27:5 God forbid that I @# justify you: till I die I will not
remove mine integrity from me.

27:6 My @ceousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my @
@ not reproach me so long as I live.

27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up @
 me
as the un@ceous.

27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
when God taketh away his soul?  27:9 Will God hear his cry when
trouble cometh upon him?  27:10 Will he delight @9 in the
Al@By? will he always call upon God?  27:11 I will teach you by the
hand of God: that @ is with the Al@By will I not conceal.

27:12 @., all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
al@? vain?  27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
and the heritage of oppressors, @ they @ receive of the
Al@By.

27:14 If his @ be multiplied, it is for the @Q: and his
offspring @ not be satisfied with @d.

27:15 Those that remain of him @ be buried in @^: and his
widows @ not weep.

27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the
clay; 27:17 He may prepare it, but the just @ put it on, and the
innocent @ divide the silver.

27:18 He buildeth his @ as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper
maketh.

27:19 The rich man @ lie down, but he @ not be ga@d: he
openeth his eyes, and he is not.

27:20 Terrors take hold on him as @Zs, a tempest stealeth him away
in the night.

27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
storm hurleth him out of his @'.

27:22 For God @ cast upon him, and not spare: he @L fain flee
out of his hand.

27:23 Men @ clap @ @D at him, and @ hiss him out of his
@'.

28:1 Surely @ is a vein for the silver, and a @' for gold where
they fine it.

28:2 Iron is taken out of the @, and brass is molten out of the
stone.

28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection:
the stones of darkness, and the shadow of @^.

28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the @Zs
forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.

28:5 As for the @, out of it cometh @d: and @[ it is turned
up as it were fire.

28:6 The stones of it are the @' of sapphires: and it hath dust of
gold.

28:7 There is a path @ no fowl knoweth, and @ the vulture's
eye hath not seen: 28:8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the
fierce lion passed by it.

28:9 He putteth @ his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
mountains by the roots.

28:10 He cutteth out rivers @ the rocks; and his eye seeth @
precious @7.

28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the @7 that is
hid @(eth he @ to light.

28:12 But where @ wisdom be @V? and where is the @' of
@[standing?  28:13 Man knoweth not the price @of; @" is it
@V in the land of the living.

28:14 The depth @
, It is not in me: and the sea @
, It is not
with me.

28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, @" @ silver be weighed
for the price @of.

28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
onyx, or the sapphire.

28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
@ not be for jewels of fine gold.

28:18 No mention @ be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
of wisdom is above rubies.

28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia @ not equal it, @" @ it be
valued with pure gold.

28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the @' of
@[standing?  28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
and kept close from the fowls of the air.

28:22 Destruction and @^ say, We have @) the fame @of with
our ears.

28:23 God @[standeth the way @of, and he knoweth the @'
@of.

28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the @, and seeth @[ the
whole @1; 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth
the @Zs by measure.

28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
of the th@[: 28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared
it, yea, and searched it out.

28:28 And unto man he said, @., the fear of the LORD, that is
wisdom; and to depart from evil is @[standing.

29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were
as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 29:3 When his
candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked @E
darkness; 29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of
God was upon my tabernacle; 29:5 When the Al@By was yet with me,
when my @ were @+ me; 29:6 When I washed my steps with
butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 29:7 When I went out
to the gate @E the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
29:8 The young men saw me, and hid @T: and the aged arose, and
stood up.

29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid @ hand on @
@P.

29:10 The nobles held @ @U, and @ tongue cleaved to the
roof of @ @P.

29:11 When the ear @) me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
me, it gave witness to me: 29:12 Because I delivered the poor that
cried, and the @less, and him that had none to help him.

29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I
caused the widow's @ to sing for joy.

29:14 I put on @ceousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a
robe and a diadem.

29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

29:16 I was a @ to the poor: and the cause @ I knew not I
searched out.

29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth.

29:18 Then I said, I @ die in my nest, and I @ multiply my
days as the sand.

29:19 My root was spread out by the @Zs, and the dew lay all night
upon my branch.

29:20 My @Y was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
counsel.

29:22 After my @5 they @0 not @*; and my speech dropped upon
them.

29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened @
@P wide as for the latter rain.

29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
countenance they cast not down.

29:25 I chose out @ way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the
army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose
@s I @L have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

30:2 Yea, whereto @B the strength of @ @D profit me, in whom
old age was perished?  30:3 For want and famine they were solitary;
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for @
meat.

30:5 They were driven @ from @ men, (they cried @ them as
@ a thief;) 30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves
of the @, and in the rocks.

30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; @[ the nettles they were
ga@d @?.

30:8 They were @ of fools, yea, @ of base men: they were
viler than the @.

30:9 And now am I @ song, yea, I am @ byword.

30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
my face.

30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also
let loose the bridle @	 me.

30:12 Upon my @c hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
they raise up @
 me the ways of @ destruction.

30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
helper.

30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of @Zs: in the
desolation they rolled @T upon me.

30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and
my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
have taken hold upon me.

30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
take no rest.

30:18 By the @ force of my disease is my garment changed: it
bindeth me @+ as the collar of my coat.

30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
ashes.

30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
regardest me not.

30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
thyself @
 me.

30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
and dissolvest my substance.

30:23 For I know that thou wilt @( me to @^, and to the @
appointed for all living.

30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
they cry in his destruction.

30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
grieved for the poor?  30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came
unto me: and when I waited for light, @ came darkness.

30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
prevented me.

30:28 I went mourning @S the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
@`.

30:29 I am a @X to dragons, and a companion to owls.

30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the @;
of them that weep.

31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then @# I think upon a
maid?  31:2 For what portion of God is @ from above? and what
inheritance of the Al@By from on high?  31:3 Is not destruction to
the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?  31:4
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?  31:5 If I have
walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 31:6 Let me
be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.

31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine @ walked
@ mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine @D; 31:8 Then
let me sow, and let @F eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.

31:9 If mine @ have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
wait at my neighbour's door; 31:10 Then let my wife grind unto
@F, and let @Cs bow down upon her.

31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges.

31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and @L root
out all mine increase.

31:13 If I did despise the cause of my man@< or of my
maid@<, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then @ I do
when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what @ I answer him?
31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
fashion us in the womb?  31:16 If I have withheld the poor from @
desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 31:17 Or have
eaten my morsel myself alone, and the @less hath not eaten
@of; 31:18 (For from my youth he was @ up with me, as with a
@, and I have guided her from my m@C's womb;) 31:19 If I have
seen any perish for want of clo@7, or any poor @S covering;
31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with
the fleece of my sheep; 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand @
 the
@less, when I saw my help in the gate: 31:22 Then let mine arm
fall from my @#er blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.

31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
his highness I could not endure.

31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou
art my confidence; 31:25 If I rejoice @ my wealth was @, and
@ mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it
shined, or the moon walking in b@cness; 31:27 And my @ hath
been secretly enticed, or my @P hath kissed my hand: 31:28 This
also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I @# have
denied the God that is above.

31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted
up myself when evil @V him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my @P
to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.

31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
@R!  we cannot be satisfied.

31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
to the traveller.

31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom: 31:34 Did I fear a @ multitude, or did the contempt
of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the
door?  31:35 Oh that one @L hear me! @%, my desire is, that the
Al@By @L answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.

31:36 Surely I @L take it upon my @#er, and bind it as a crown
to me.

31:37 I @L declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
@L I go near unto him.

31:38 If my land cry @
 me, or that the furrows likewise @of
complain; 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits @of @S money, or
have caused the owners @of to lose @ life: 31:40 Let thistles
grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.

The @5 of Job are ended.

32:1 So @ @@ men ceased to answer Job, @ he was @ceous
in his own eyes.

32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the

 Job was his wrath kindled,
@ he justified @9 rather than God.

32:3 Also @
 his @@ friends was his wrath kindled, @
they had @V no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, @ they were elder

32:5 When Elihu saw that @ was no answer in the @P of @

32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite @> and said, I am

32:7 I said, Days @# @K, and multitude of @8 @# teach

32:8 But @ is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Al@By

32:9 Great men are not always wise: @" do the aged @[stand

32:10 @N I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

32:11 @., I waited for your @5; I gave ear to your reasons,

32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, @%, @ was none of you

32:14 Now he hath not directed his @5 @

32:15 They were amazed, they @> no more: they left off @King.

32:16 When I had waited, (for they @0 not, but stood still, and
@> no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also
will shew mine opinion.

32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

32:19 @., my belly is as wine @ hath no vent; it is ready to

32:20 I will @K, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and

32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, @" let me
give flattering titles unto man.

32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
@L soon take me away.

33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all

33:2 @., now I have opened my @P, my tongue hath spoken in my

33:3 My @5 @ be of the up@cness of my @: and my lips

33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Al@By

33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy @5 in order @	 me, stand

33:6 @., I am @$ to thy wish in God's stead: I also am

33:7 @., my terror @ not make thee afraid, @" @ my

33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have @) the

33:10 @., he findeth occasions @

33:12 @., in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God
is @er than man.

33:13 Why dost thou strive @
 him? for he giveth not account of
any of his matters.

33:14 For God @Keth once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 33:16 Then he openeth the ears
of men, and sealeth @ instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man
from his purpose, and hide pride from man.

33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
perishing by the @Q.

33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
of his bones with strong pain: 33:20 So that his life abhorreth @d,
and his soul dainty meat.

33:21 His @R is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
bones that were not seen stick out.

33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
destroyers.

33:23 If @ be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one @ a

, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have

33:25 His @R @ be fresher than a child's: he @ return to
the days of his youth: 33:26 He @ pray unto God, and he will be
favourable unto him: and he @ see his face with joy: for he will
render unto man his @ceousness.

33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
perverted that @ was @c, and it profited me not; 33:28 He will
deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life @ see the

33:29 Lo, all @ @ worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To
@( back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of

33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy @U, and I will
@K.

33:32 If thou hast any@7 to say, answer me: @K, for I desire to
justify thee.

33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy @U, and I @ teach thee
wisdom.

34:1 Furthermore Elihu @> and said, 34:2 Hear my @5, O ye
wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.

34:3 For the ear trieth @5, as the @P tasteth meat.

34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know @ ourselves what is
good.

34:5 For Job hath said, I am @ceous: and God hath taken away my
judgment.

34:6 Should I lie @
 my @c? my wound is incurable @S
transgression.

34:7 What man is like Job, who @beth up scorning like @Z?  34:8
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with
wicked men.

34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man no@7 that he @#
delight @9 with God.

34:10 @N hearken unto me ye men of @[standing: far be it
from God, that he @# do wickedness; and from the Al@By, that he
@# commit iniquity.

34:11 For the work of a man @ he render unto him, and cause @
man to find @$ to his ways.

34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, @" will the Al@By
pervert judgment.

34:13 Who hath @= him a charge over the @? or who hath disposed
the whole world?  34:14 If he set his @ upon man, if he gather
unto @9 his spirit and his breath; 34:15 All @R @ perish
@?, and man @ turn @* unto dust.

34:16 If now thou hast @[standing, hear this: hearken to the @;
of my @5.

34:17 Shall even he that hateth @c govern? and wilt thou condemn
him that is most just?  34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art
wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?  34:19 How much less to him
that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more
than the poor? for they all are the work of his @D.

34:20 In a moment @ they die, and the @ @ be troubled at
midnight, and pass away: and the @By @ be taken away @S
hand.

34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
goings.

34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of @^, where the workers of
iniquity may hide @T.

34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than @c; that he @#
enter into judgment with God.

34:24 He @ break in pieces @By men @S number, and set
@Cs in @ stead.

34:25 @N he knoweth @ works, and he overturneth them in the
night, so that they are destroyed.

34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of @Cs;
34:27 Because they turned back from him, and @L not consider any of
his ways: 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto
him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
hideth his face, who then can @% him? whether it be done @
 a
nation, or @
 a man only: 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not,
lest the @ be ensnared.

34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
chastisement, I will not offend any more: 34:32 That @ I see not
teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.

34:33 Should it be @$ to thy mind? he will recompense it,
whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: @fore
@K what thou knowest.

34:34 Let men of @[standing tell me, and let a wise man hearken
unto me.

34:35 Job hath spoken @S knowledge, and his @5 were @S
wisdom.

34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end @ of his
answers for wicked men.

34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his @D
@ us, and multiplieth his @5 @
 God.

35:1 Elihu @0 moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be
@c, that thou saidst, My @ceousness is more than God's?  35:3
For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit
@ I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?  35:4 I will answer thee,
and thy companions with thee.

35:5 Look unto the @1s, and see; and @% the clouds @ are
higher than thou.

35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou @
 him? or if thy
transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  35:7 If thou
be @ceous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of @
hand?  35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
@ceousness may profit the son of man.

35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the @By.

35:10 But none @
, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
night; 35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the @, and
maketh us wiser than the fowls of @1?  35:12 There they cry, but
none giveth answer, @ of the pride of evil men.

35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, @" will the Al@By
regard it.

35:14 Although thou sayest thou @ not see him, yet judgment is
@	 him; @fore trust thou in him.

35:15 But now, @ it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet
he knoweth it not in @ extremity: 35:16 @N doth Job open
his @P in vain; he multiplieth @5 @S knowledge.

36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I
will shew thee that I have yet to @K on God's behalf.

36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
@ceousness to my Maker.

36:4 For truly my @5 @ not be false: he that is perfect in
knowledge is with thee.

36:5 @., God is @By, and despiseth not any: he is @By in
strength and wisdom.

36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth @c to the
poor.

36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the @ceous: but with kings
are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they
are exalted.

36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
affliction; 36:9 Then he sheweth them @ work, and @
transgressions that they have exceeded.

36:10 He openeth also @ ear to discipline, and commandeth that
they return from iniquity.

36:11 If they obey and serve him, they @ spend @ days in
prosperity, and @ @8 in pleasures.

36:12 But if they obey not, they @ perish by the @Q, and they
@ die @S knowledge.

36:13 But the hypocrites in @ heap up wrath: they cry not when he
bindeth them.

36:14 They die in youth, and @ life is @ the unclean.

36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth @ ears
in oppression.

36:16 Even so @L he have removed thee out of the strait into a
broad @', where @ is no straitness; and that @ @# be
set on thy table @# be full of fatness.

36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
justice take hold on thee.

36:18 Because @ is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
stroke: then a @ ransom cannot deliver thee.

36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
strength.

36:20 Desire not the night, when @ are cut off in @ @'.

36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
than affliction.

36:22 @., God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  36:23
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought
iniquity?  36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, @ men
@%.

36:25 Every man may see it; man may @% it afar off.

36:26 @., God is @, and we know him not, @" can the
number of his @8 be searched out.

36:27 For he maketh small the drops of @Z: they pour down rain
@$ to the vapour @of: 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and
distil upon man abundantly.

36:29 Also can any @[stand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
noise of his tabernacle?  36:30 @., he spreadeth his light upon
it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.

36:31 For by them judgeth he the @; he giveth meat in abundance.

36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

36:33 The noise @of sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
concerning the vapour.

37:1 At this also my @ trembleth, and is moved out of his @'.

37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his @;, and the sound that goeth
out of his @P.

37:3 He directeth it @[ the whole @1, and his lightning unto
the ends of the @.

37:4 After it a @; roareth: he th@[eth with the @; of his
excellency; and he will not stay them when his @; is @).

37:5 God th@[eth marvellously with his @;; @ @ doeth
he, @ we cannot comprehend.

37:6 For he @
 to the snow, Be thou on the @; likewise to the
small rain, and to the @ rain of his strength.

37:7 He sealeth up the hand of @ man; that all men may know his
work.

37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in @ @'s.

37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.

37:10 By the breath of God frost is @=: and the @dth of the
@Zs is straitened.

37:11 Also by @Zing he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his
b@c cloud: 37:12 And it is turned round @+ by his counsels: that
they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world
in the @.

37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,
or for mercy.

37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous
works of God.

37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
his cloud to shine?  37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of the
clouds, the wondrous works of him @ is perfect in knowledge?
37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the @ by the
south wind?  37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, @ is
strong, and as a molten looking glass?  37:19 Teach us what we @
say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.

37:20 Shall it be told him that I @K? if a man @K, surely he
@ be swallowed up.

37:21 And now men see not the b@c light @ is in the clouds: but
the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
majesty.

37:23 Touching the Al@By, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not
afflict.

37:24 Men do @fore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
of @.

38:1 Then the LORD @> Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by @5 @S knowledge?  38:3
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and
answer thou me.

38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the @Vations of the @?
declare, if thou hast @[standing.

38:5 Who hath laid the measures @of, if thou knowest? or who hath
stretched the line upon it?  38:6 Whereupon are the @Vations
@of fastened? or who laid the corner stone @of; 38:7 When the
morning stars sang @?, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake @, as if it
had issued out of the womb?  38:9 When I made the cloud the garment
@of, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 38:10 And brake up
for it my decreed @', and set bars and doors, 38:11 And said,
Hitherto @ thou come, but no further: and here @ thy proud
waves be stayed?  38:12 Hast thou @M the morning since thy
days; and caused the dayspring to know his @'; 38:13 That it @B
take hold of the ends of the @, that the wicked @B be shaken
out of it?  38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as

38:15 And from the wicked @ light is withholden, and the high arm
@ be broken.

38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
walked in the search of the depth?  38:17 Have the gates of @^ been
opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of @^?
38:18 Hast thou perceived the @dth of the @? declare if thou

38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,

the day of battle and war?  38:24 By what way is the light parted,
@ scattereth the east wind upon the @?  38:25 Who hath divided

the drops of dew?  38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary
frost of @1, who hath gendered it?  38:30 The @Zs are hid as

38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the

or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?  38:33 Knowest thou the
ordinances of @1? canst thou set the dominion @of in the

abundance of @Zs may cover thee?  38:35 Canst thou send lightnings,
that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?  38:36 Who hath put
wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath @= @[standing to the
@?  38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
bottles of @1, 38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the
clods cleave fast @??  38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the
lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 38:40 When they couch
in @ dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?  38:41 Who
provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God,
they wander for lack of meat.

39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock @(
@? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?  39:2 Canst thou
number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they
@( @?  39:3 They bow @T, they @( @ @ young
ones, they cast out @ sorrows.

39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they
go @, and return not unto them.

39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands
of the wild ass?  39:6 Whose @ I have made the wilderness, and the
barren land his dwellings.

39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, @" regardeth he the
crying of the driver.

39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth @
@ green @7.

39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will
he harrow the valleys @ thee?  39:11 Wilt thou trust him, @
his strength is @? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  39:12
Wilt thou believe him, that he will @( home thy seed, and gather it
into thy barn?  39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?  39:14 Which leaveth her eggs
in the @, and warmeth them in dust, 39:15 And forgetteth that the
foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.

39:16 She is hardened @
 her young ones, as though they were not
her's: her labour is in vain @S fear; 39:17 Because God hath
deprived her of wisdom, @" hath he imparted to her @[standing.

39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse
and his rider.

39:19 Hast thou @= the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
with th@[?  39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the
@Y of his nostrils is terrible.

39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth
on to meet the armed men.

39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not aff@ced; @" turneth he
back from the @Q.

39:23 The quiver rattleth @
 him, the glittering spear and the
shield.

39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: @"
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

39:25 He @
 @ the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle
afar off, the th@[ of the captains, and the shouting.

39:26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
the south?  39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her
nest on high?  39:28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the
crag of the rock, and the strong @'.

39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes @% afar off.

39:30 Her young ones also suck up @I: and where the slain are,

40:1 Moreover the LORD @> Job, and said, 40:2 Shall he that
contendeth with the Al@By instruct him? he that reproveth God, let
him answer it.

40:3 Then Job @> the LORD, and said, 40:4 @., I am vile;
what @ I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my @P.

40:5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will
proceed no further.

40:6 Then @> the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
40:7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
declare thou unto me.

40:8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that
thou mayest be @ceous?  40:9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst

majesty and excellency; and array thyself with @Y and beauty.

40:11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and @% @ one that is
proud, and abase him.

40:12 Look on @ one that is proud, and @( him low; and tread
down the wicked in @ @'.

40:13 Hide them in the dust @?; and bind @ faces in secret.

40:14 Then will I also confess unto thee that @ own @c hand can
save thee.

40:15 @. now behemoth, @ I made with thee; he eateth grass as
an ox.

40:16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
navel of his belly.

40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
wrapped @?.

40:18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars
of iron.

40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
his @Q to approach unto him.

40:20 Surely the mountains @( him @ food, where all the beasts
of the field play.

40:21 He lieth @[ the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
fens.

40:22 The shady trees cover him with @ shadow; the willows of the
brook compass him @+.

40:23 @., he @beth up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
that he can draw up Jordan into his @P.

40:24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth @E snares.

41:1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a
cord @ thou lettest down?  41:2 Canst thou put an hook into his
nose? or bore his jaw @E with a thorn?  41:3 Will he make many
supplications unto thee? will he @K soft @5 unto thee?  41:4
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a @<
for ever?  41:5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou
bind him for thy maidens?  41:6 Shall the companions make a banquet of
him? @ they part him @ the merchants?  41:7 Canst thou fill
his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?  41:8 Lay
@ hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

41:9 @., the hope of him is in vain: @ not one be cast down
even at the sight of him?  41:10 None is so fierce that dare stir him
up: who then is able to stand @	 me?  41:11 Who hath prevented me,
that I @# repay him? whatsoever is @[ the whole @1 is mine.

41:12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
proportion.

41:13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him
with his double bridle?  41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? his
teeth are terrible round @+.

41:15 His scales are his pride, shut up @? as with a close seal.

41:16 One is so near to @F, that no air can come between them.

41:17 They are joined one to @F, they stick @?, that they
cannot be s@[ed.

41:18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
eyelids of the morning.

41:19 Out of his @P go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.

41:20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a see@7 pot or
caldron.

41:21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his @P.

41:22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
@	 him.

41:23 The flakes of his @R are joined @?: they are firm in
@T; they cannot be moved.

41:24 His @ is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the
nether millstone.

41:25 When he raiseth up @9, the @By are afraid: by reason of
breakings they purify @T.

41:26 The @Q of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the
dart, nor the habergeon.

41:27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

41:28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him
into stubble.

41:29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
spear.

41:30 Sharp stones are @[ him: he spreadeth sharp pointed @
upon the mire.

41:31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a
pot of ointment.

41:32 He maketh a path to shine @ him; one @L think the deep to
be hoary.

41:33 Upon @ @ is not his like, who is made @S fear.

41:34 He @%eth all high @: he is a king over all the @

42:1 Then Job @> the LORD, and said, 42:2 I know that thou canst
do @ @7, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.

42:3 Who is he that hideth counsel @S knowledge? @fore have I
uttered that I @[stood not; @ too wonderful for me, @ I
knew not.

42:4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will @K: I will demand of thee,
and declare thou unto me.

42:5 I have @) of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye
seeth thee.

42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

42:7 And it was so, that @ the LORD had spoken @ @5 unto
Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled
@
 thee, and @
 thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of
me the @7 that is @c, as my @< Job hath.

42:8 @N take unto you now @H bullocks and @H rams, and go
to my @< Job, and offer up for yourselves a @_ @&; and
my @< Job @ pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal
with you @ your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the @7
@ is @c, like my @< Job.

42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
Naamathite went, and did @$ as the LORD @M them: the
LORD also accepted Job.

42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had @	.

42:11 Then came @ unto him all his @3, and all his sisters,
and all they that had been of his acquaintance @	, and did eat
@d with him in his @: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him
over all the evil that the LORD had @ upon him: @ man also
gave him a piece of money, and @ one an earring of gold.

42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
beginning: for he had fourteen @: sheep, and six @:
camels, and a @: yoke of oxen, and a @: she asses.

42:13 He had also @H sons and @@ daughters.

42:14 And he @, the name of the @O, Jemima; and the name of the
second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

42:15 And in all the land were no women @V so fair as the daughters
of Job: and @ @ gave them inheritance @ @ @3.

42:16 After this lived Job an @/ and forty @8, and saw his
sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

42:17 So Job died, being old and full of days.




The Book of Psalms


1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful.

1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
meditate day and night.

1:3 And he @ be like a tree planted by the rivers of @Z, that
@(eth @ his fruit in his season; his leaf also @ not
wither; and whatsoever he doeth @ prosper.

1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff @ the wind
driveth away.

1:5 @N the ungodly @ not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
in the @` of the @ceous.

1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the @ceous: but the way of the
ungodly @ perish.



2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the @ imagine a vain @7?

2:2 The kings of the @ set @T, and the rulers take counsel
@?, @
 the LORD, and @
 his anointed, @,

2:3 Let us break @ bands as@[, and cast away @ cords from
us.

2:4 He that sitteth in the @1s @ laugh: the LORD @ have
them in derision.

2:5 Then @ he @K unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his
sore displeasure.

2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son; this day have I begotten thee.

2:8 Ask of me, and I @ give thee the heathen for @
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the @ for thy possession.

2:9 Thou @ break them with a rod of iron; thou @ dash them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.

2:10 Be wise now @fore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
the @.

2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when
his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put @
trust in him.



3:1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that
rise up @

3:2 Many @ be @ say of my soul, There is no help for him in
God.

Selah.

3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my @Y, and the lifter up
of mine head.

3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my @;, and he @) me out of his
holy hill. Selah.

3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

3:6 I will not be afraid of ten @:s of @, that have set
@T @
 me round @+.

3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
ungodly.

3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
@.

Selah.



4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my @ceousness: thou hast enlarged
me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my @Y into shame? how
long will ye love vanity, and seek @ leasing? Selah.

4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
@9: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own @ upon your
bed, and be still. Selah.

4:5 Offer the sacrifices of @ceousness, and put your trust in the
LORD.

4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou
up the light of thy countenance upon us.

4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my @, more than in the time that
@ corn and @ wine increased.

4:8 I will both lay me down in @U, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only
makest me dwell in safety.



5:1 Give ear to my @5, O LORD, consider my meditation.

5:2 Hearken unto the @; of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto
thee will I pray.

5:3 My @; @ thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: @"
@ evil dwell with thee.

5:5 The foolish @ not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers
of iniquity.

5:6 Thou @ destroy them that @K leasing: the LORD will abhor
the @Iy and deceitful man.

5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy @ in the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy @ceousness @ of mine enemies;
make thy way straight @	 my face.

5:9 For @ is no faithfulness in @ @P; @ inward part is
very wickedness; @ throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with
@ tongue.

5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by @ own counsels;
cast them out in the multitude of @ transgressions; for they have
rebelled @
 thee.

5:11 But let all @J that put @ trust in thee rejoice: let them
ever shout for joy, @ thou defendest them: let them also that
love thy name be joyful in thee.

5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the @ceous; with favour wilt thou
compass him as with a shield.



6:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in @ anger, @" chasten me in thy
hot displeasure.

6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
bones are vexed.

6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.

6:5 For in @^ @ is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
@ give thee thanks?

6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;
I @Z my couch with my tears.

6:7 Mine eye is consumed @ of grief; it waxeth old @ of
all mine enemies.

6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
@) the @; of my weeping.

6:9 The LORD hath @) my supplication; the LORD will receive my
prayer.

6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return
and be ashamed suddenly.



7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me:

7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
@ is none to deliver.

7:3 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if @ be iniquity in my
@D;

7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at @U with me; (yea,
I have delivered him that @S cause is mine enemy:)

7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread
down my life upon the @, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

7:6 Arise, O LORD, in @ anger, lift up thyself @ of the rage
of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast
@M.

7:7 So @ the @` of the @ compass thee @+: for
@ sakes @fore return thou on high.

7:8 The LORD @ judge the @: judge me, O LORD, @$ to my
@ceousness, and @$ to mine integrity that is in me.

7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
the just: for the @ceous God trieth the @s and reins.

7:10 My defence is of God, @ saveth the up@c in @.

7:11 God judgeth the @ceous, and God is angry with the wicked @
day.

7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his @Q; he hath bent his bow, and
made it ready.

7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of @^; he
ordaineth his arrows @
 the persecutors.

7:14 @., he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,
and @ @ falsehood.

7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch @

7:16 His mischief @ return upon his own head, and his violent

7:17 I will praise the LORD @$ to his @ceousness: and will
sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.



8:1 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the @! who
hast set thy @Y above the @1s.

8:2 Out of the @P of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength @ of @ enemies, that thou @Best still the enemy
and the avenger.

8:3 When I consider thy @1s, the work of thy fingers, the moon and
the stars, @ thou hast ordained;

8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
that thou visitest him?

8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast
crowned him with @Y and honour.

8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy @D; thou
hast put all @ @[ his feet:

8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
passeth @E the paths of the seas.

8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the @!


9:1 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole @; I will shew @
all thy marvellous works.

9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
name, O thou most High.

9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they @ fall and perish at
thy presence.

9:4 For thou hast maintained my @c and my cause; thou satest in the
throne judging @c.

9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
thou hast put out @ name for ever and ever.

9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou
hast destroyed @G; @ memorial is perished with them.

9:7 But the LORD @ endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne
for judgment.

9:8 And he @ judge the world in @ceousness, he @ minister
judgment to the @ in up@cness.

9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
times of trouble.

9:10 And they that know thy name will put @ trust in thee: for
thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, @ dwelleth in Zion: declare @
the @ his doings.

9:12 When he maketh inquisition for @I, he remembereth them: he
forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble @ I suffer of
them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of @^:

9:14 That I may shew @ all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net
@ they hid is @ own foot taken.

9:16 The LORD is known by the judgment @ he executeth: the wicked
is snared in the work of his own @D. Higgaion. Selah.

9:17 The wicked @ be turned into hell, and all the nations that

9:18 For the needy @ not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
the poor @ not perish for ever.

9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in
thy sight.

9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know @T to
be but men. Selah.



10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
times of trouble?

10:2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
taken in the devices that they have imagined.

10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his @'s desire, and blesseth the
covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

10:4 The wicked, @E the pride of his countenance, will not seek
@ God: God is not in all his thoughts.

10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of
his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

10:6 He hath said in his @, I @ not be moved: for I @
never be in adversity.

10:7 His @P is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: @[ his
tongue is mischief and vanity.

10:8 He sitteth in the lurking @'s of the villages: in the secret
@'s doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set @

the poor.

10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait
to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into
his net.

10:10 He croucheth, and humbleth @9, that the poor may fall by
his strong ones.

10:11 He hath said in his @, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
face; he will never see it.

10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up @ hand: forget not the humble.

10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
@, Thou wilt not require it.

10:14 Thou hast seen it; for thou @%est mischief and spite, to
requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth @9 unto thee; thou
art the helper of the @less.

10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his
wickedness till thou find none.

10:16 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out
of his land.

10:17 LORD, thou hast @) the desire of the humble: thou wilt
prepare @ @, thou wilt cause @ ear to hear:

10:18 To judge the @less and the oppressed, that the man of the
@ may no more oppress.



11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird
to your mountain?

11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend @ bow, they make ready @ arrow
upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the up@c in @.

11:3 If the @Vations be destroyed, what can the @ceous do?

11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in @1:
his eyes @%, his eyelids try, the @ of men.

11:5 The LORD trieth the @ceous: but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth.

11:6 Upon the wicked he @ rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
horrible tempest: this @ be the portion of @ cup.

11:7 For the @ceous LORD loveth @ceousness; his countenance doth
@% the up@c.



12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
@ the @ of men.

12:2 They @K vanity @ one with his neighbour: with flattering
lips and with a double @ do they @K.

12:3 The LORD @ cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
@Keth proud @:

12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our
own: who is lord over us?

12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
will I arise, @
 the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that
puffeth at him.

12:6 The @5 of the LORD are pure @5: as silver tried in a
furnace of @, purified @H times.

12:7 Thou @ keep them, O LORD, thou @ preserve them from this
generation for ever.

12:8 The wicked walk on @ side, when the vilest men are exalted.



13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me?

13:2 How long @ I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
@ daily? how long @ mine enemy be exalted over me?

13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
sleep the sleep of @^;

13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed @
 him; and @J that
trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my @ @ rejoice in thy
salvation.

13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, @ he hath dealt bountifully with
me.



14:1 The fool hath said in his @, There is no God. They are
corrupt, they have done abominable works, @ is none that doeth
good.

14:2 The LORD looked down from @1 upon the @ of men, to see
if @ were any that did @[stand, and seek God.

14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all @? become filthy:
@ is none that doeth good, no, not one.

14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
@ as they eat @d, and call not upon the LORD.

14:5 There were they in @ fear: for God is in the generation of
the @ceous.

14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, @ the LORD is his

14:7 Oh that the salvation of @ were come out of Zion! when the
LORD @(eth back the captivity of his @, @] @ rejoice,

15:1 Lord, who @ abide in thy tabernacle? who @ dwell in thy

15:2 He that walketh up@cly, and worketh @ceousness, and

15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach @
 his neighbour.

15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them
that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth

15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
@
 the innocent. He that doeth @ @ @ never be moved.



16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
goodness extendeth not to thee;

16:3 But to the saints that are in the @, and to the excellent, in
whom is all my delight.

16:4 Their sorrows @ be multiplied that hasten @ @F god:
@ @b @&s of @I will I not offer, nor take up @

16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
maintainest my lot.

16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant @'s; yea, I have a
goodly heritage.

16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath @= me counsel: my reins also
instruct me in the night seasons.

16:8 I have set the LORD always @	 me: @ he is at my @c

16:9 @N my @ is glad, and my @Y rejoiceth: my @R also

16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; @" wilt thou
suffer @ Holy One to see corruption.

16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
of joy; at thy @c hand @ are pleasures for evermore.



17:1 Hear the @c, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

17:2 Let my sentence come @ from thy presence; let @ eyes

17:3 Thou hast proved mine @; thou hast visited me in the night;
thou hast tried me, and @ find no@7; I am purposed that my
@P @ not transgress.

17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept
me from the paths of the destroyer.

17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

17:6 I have @, upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
@ ear unto me, and hear my speech.

17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
@c hand them @ put @ trust in thee from @J that rise up

17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me @[ the shadow of thy

17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
compass me @+.

17:10 They are inclosed in @ own fat: with @ @P they @K
proudly.

17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set @
eyes bowing down to the @;

17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
young lion lurking in secret @'s.

17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
from the wicked, @ is thy @Q:

17:14 From men @ are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
@ have @ portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest
with thy hid treasure: they are full of @, and leave the rest
of @ substance to @ babes.

17:15 As for me, I will @% thy face in @ceousness: I @ be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.



18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
salvation, and my high tower.

18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so @
I be saved from mine enemies.

18:4 The sorrows of @^ compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid.

18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me @+: the snares of @^
prevented me.

18:6 In my distress I @, upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
@) my @; out of his temple, and my cry came @	 him, even
into his ears.

18:7 Then the @ shook and trembled; the @Vations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, @ he was wroth.

18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
@P devoured: coals were kindled by it.

18:9 He bowed the @1s also, and came down: and darkness was @[
his feet.

18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the
wings of the wind.

18:11 He made darkness his secret @'; his pavilion round @+ him
were dark @Zs and thick clouds of the skies.

18:12 At the b@cness that was @	 him his thick clouds passed,
hail stones and coals of fire.

18:13 The LORD also th@[ed in the @1s, and the Highest gave his
@;; hail stones and coals of fire.

18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.

18:15 Then the channels of @Zs were seen, and the @Vations of
the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils.

18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many @Zs.

18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them @ hated
me: for they were too strong for me.

18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
stay.

18:19 He @ me @ also into a large @'; he delivered me,
@ he delighted in me.

18:20 The LORD rewarded me @$ to my @ceousness; @$ to
the cleanness of my @D hath he recompensed me.

18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.

18:22 For all his judgments were @	 me, and I did not put away his
statutes from me.

18:23 I was also up@c @	 him, and I kept myself from mine
iniquity.

18:24 @N hath the LORD recompensed me @$ to my
@ceousness, @$ to the cleanness of my @D in his eyesight.

18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
up@c man thou wilt shew thyself up@c;

18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward.

18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted @; but wilt @( down
high looks.

18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness.

18:29 For by thee I have run @E a troop; and by my God have I
leaped over a wall.

18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
he is a buckler to all @J that trust in him.

18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
perfect.

18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
@'s.

18:34 He teacheth my @D to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms.

18:35 Thou hast also @= me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
@c hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me @.

18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps @[ me, that my feet did not slip.

18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: @" did I
turn @* till they were consumed.

18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
fallen @[ my feet.

18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
subdued @[ me @J that rose up @
 me.

18:40 Thou hast also @= me the necks of mine enemies; that I @B
destroy them that hate me.

18:41 They cried, but @ was none to save them: even unto the LORD,
but he @> them not.

18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust @	 the wind: I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the @; and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a @ whom I have not
known @ serve me.

18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they @ obey me: the strangers
@ submit @T unto me.

18:45 The strangers @ fade away, and be afraid out of @ close
@'s.

18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted.

18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the @ @[ me.

18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
above @J that rise up @
 me: thou hast delivered me from the
violent man.

18:49 @N will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, @ the
heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, to @, and to his seed for evermore.



19:1 The @1s declare the @Y of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork.

19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.

19:3 There is no speech nor language, where @ @; is not @).

19:4 Their line is gone out @E all the @, and @ @5 to

19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth

19:6 His going @ is from the end of the @1, and his circuit
unto the ends of it: and @ is no@7 hid from the heat @of.

19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

19:8 The statutes of the LORD are @c, rejoicing the @: the
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
of the LORD are true and @ceous al@?.

19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

19:11 Moreover by them is thy @< warned: and in keeping of them
@ is @ reward.

19:12 Who can @[stand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
faults.

19:13 Keep back thy @< also from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me: then @ I be up@c, and I @ be
innocent from the @ transgression.

19:14 Let the @5 of my @P, and the meditation of my @, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.



20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of

20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
Zion;

20:3 Remember all thy @&s, and accept thy @_ sacrifice;
Selah.

20:4 Grant thee @$ to @ own @, and fulfil all thy

20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
from his holy @1 with the saving strength of his @c hand.

20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember
the name of the LORD our God.

20:8 They are @ down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand

20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.



21:1 The king @ joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation
how @ly @ he rejoice!

21:2 Thou hast @= him his @'s desire, and hast not withholden
the request of his lips. Selah.

21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
days for ever and ever.

21:5 His @Y is @ in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him.

21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance.

21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and @E the mercy of the

21:8 Thine hand @ find out all @ enemies: thy @c hand @

21:9 Thou @ make them as a fiery oven in the time of @ anger:
the LORD @ swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire @ devour

21:10 Their fruit @ thou destroy from the @, and @ seed

21:11 For they intended evil @

21:12 @N @ thou make them turn @ back, when thou @

21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in @ own strength: so will we sing

22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
from helping me, and from the @5 of my roaring?

22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
night season, and am not silent.

22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of @.

22:4 Our @s trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
them.

22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,
and were not con@Ved.

22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
the @.

22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,
they shake the head, @,

22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he @L deliver him: let him deliver
him, seeing he delighted in him.

22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me
hope when I was upon my m@C's breasts.

22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
m@C's belly.

22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for @ is none to
help.

22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset
me round.

22:13 They gaped upon me with @ @Ps, as a ravening and a
roaring lion.

22:14 I am poured out like @Z, and all my bones are out of joint:
my @ is like wax; it is melted in the @a of my bowels.

22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
to my jaws; and thou hast @ me into the dust of @^.

22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
inclosed me: they pierced my @D and my feet.

22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

22:18 They part my garments @ them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee

22:20 Deliver my soul from the @Q; my darling from the power of the

22:21 Save me from the lion's @P: for thou hast @) me from the

22:22 I will declare thy name unto my @3: in the @a of the

22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of @],

22:27 All the ends of the world @ remember and turn unto the LORD:

22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor @ the

23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of @ceousness

23:4 Yea, though I walk @E the valley of the shadow of @^, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they

23:5 Thou preparest a table @	 me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

23:6 Surely goodness and mercy @ follow me all the days of my

24:1 The @ is the LORD's, and the fulness @of; the world, and

24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,

25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine

25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed

25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my

25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
for they have been ever of old.

25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
@$ to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O

25:8 Good and up@c is the LORD: @fore will he teach sinners in

25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
his way.

25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep

25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is

25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he @ pluck my feet

25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and

25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put

25:21 Let integrity and up@cness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

25:22 Redeem @, O God, out of all his troubles.



26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have

26:6 I will wash mine @D in innocency: so will I compass @
@\, O LORD:

26:7 That I may publish with the @; of thanksgiving, and tell of
all thy wondrous works.

26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy @, and the @'
where @ honour dwelleth.

26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with @Iy men:

26:10 In whose @D is mischief, and @ @c hand is full of
bribes.

26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
merciful unto me.

26:12 My foot standeth in an even @': in the @`s will I
bless the LORD.



27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom @ I fear? the
LORD is the strength of my life; of whom @ I be afraid?

27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
eat up my @R, they stumbled and fell.

27:3 Though an host @# encamp @
 me, my @ @ not fear:
though war @# rise @

27:4 One @7 have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek @;
that I may dwell in the @ of the LORD all the days of my life, to
@% the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

27:5 For in the time of trouble he @ hide me in his pavilion: in
the secret of his tabernacle @ he hide me; he @ set me up upon
a rock.

27:6 And now @ mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
@+ me: @fore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my @;: have mercy also upon me,
and answer me.

27:8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my @ said unto thee, Thy
face, LORD, will I seek.

27:9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy @< away in anger:
thou hast been my help; leave me not, @" forsake me, O God of my
salvation.

27:10 When my @ and my m@C forsake me, then the LORD will take
me up.

27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, @
of mine enemies.

27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
witnesses are risen up @
 me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the
LORD in the land of the living.

27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he @ strengthen
@ @: wait, I say, on the LORD.



28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,
if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

28:2 Hear the @; of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
lift up my @D toward thy holy oracle.

28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
iniquity, @ @K @U to @ neighbours, but mischief is in
@ @s.

28:4 Give them @$ to @ deeds, and @$ to the
wickedness of @ endeavours: give them @ the work of @

28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
of his @D, he @ destroy them, and not build them up.

28:6 Blessed be the LORD, @ he hath @) the @; of my
supplications.

28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my @ trusted in him,
and I am helped: @fore my @ @ly rejoiceth; and with my

28:8 The LORD is @ strength, and he is the saving strength of his

28:9 Save thy @, and bless @ inheritance: feed them also, and
lift them up for ever.



29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye @By, give unto the LORD @Y and
strength.

29:2 Give unto the LORD the @Y due unto his name; worship the LORD
in the beauty of holiness.

29:3 The @; of the LORD is upon the @Zs: the God of @Y
th@[eth: the LORD is upon many @Zs.

29:4 The @; of the LORD is powerful; the @; of the LORD is full
of majesty.

29:5 The @; of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
the cedars of Lebanon.

29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
a young unicorn.

29:7 The @; of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

29:8 The @; of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh.

29:9 The @; of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
the forests: and in his temple doth @ one @K of his @Y.

29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
ever.

29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his @; the LORD will bless
his @ with @U.



30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me.

30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

30:3 O LORD, thou hast @ up my soul from the grave: thou hast
kept me alive, that I @# not go down to the pit.

30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness.

30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I @ never be moved.

30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

30:9 What profit is @ in my @I, when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust praise thee? @ it declare thy truth?

30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put
off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

30:12 To the end that my @Y may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent.

O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.



31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
deliver me in thy @ceousness.

31:2 Bow down @ ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
rock, for an @ of defence to save me.

31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; @fore for thy name's
sake lead me, and guide me.

31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
thou art my strength.

31:5 Into @ hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
God of truth.

31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
LORD.

31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set
my feet in a large room.

31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my @8 with sighing: my
strength faileth @ of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

31:11 I was a reproach @ all mine enemies, but especially @ my
neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me
@S fled from me.

31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
vessel.

31:13 For I have @) the slander of many: fear was on @ side:
while they took counsel @? @
 me, they devised to take away
my life.

31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies, and from them that persecute me.

31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy @<: save me for thy
mercies' sake.

31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have @, upon thee: let

31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; @ @K grievous

31:19 Oh how @ is thy goodness, @ thou hast laid up for them

@	 the sons of men!

31:20 Thou @ hide them in the secret of thy presence from the

strife of tongues.

31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city.

31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from @	 @ eyes:
nevertheless thou @)est the @; of my supplications when I cried

31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the

31:24 Be of good courage, and he @ strengthen your @, all ye

32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is for@=, whose sin is
covered.

32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
in whose spirit @ is no guile.

32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old @E my roaring all
the day long.

32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

32:6 For this @ @ one that is godly pray unto thee in a time

32:7 Thou art my hiding @'; thou @ preserve me from trouble;
thou @ compass me @+ with songs of deliverance. Selah.

32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way @ thou @

32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, @ have no

32:10 Many sorrows @ be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the

32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye @ceous: and shout for
joy, all ye that are up@c in @.



33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye @ceous: for praise is comely for the
up@c.

33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings.

33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

33:4 For the word of the LORD is @c; and all his works are done in
truth.

33:5 He loveth @ceousness and judgment: the @ is full of the
goodness of the LORD.

33:6 By the word of the LORD were the @1s made; and all the host
of them by the breath of his @P.

33:7 He ga@th the @Zs of the sea @? as an heap: he layeth

33:8 Let all the @ fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
world stand in awe of him.

33:9 For he @0, and it was done; he @M, and it stood fast.

33:10 The LORD @(eth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
maketh the devices of the @ of none effect.

33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
@ to all generations.

33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the @ whom
he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

33:13 The LORD looketh from @1; he @%eth all the sons of men.

33:14 From the @' of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the @.

33:15 He fashioneth @ @s alike; he considereth all @

33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a @By man
is not delivered by much strength.

33:17 An horse is a vain @7 for safety: @" @ he deliver
any by his @ strength.

33:18 @., the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

33:19 To deliver @ soul from @^, and to keep them alive in
famine.

33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

33:21 For our @ @ rejoice in him, @ we have trusted in

33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, @$ as we hope in thee.



34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise @ continually

34:2 My soul @ make her boast in the LORD: the humble @ hear

34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name @?.

34:4 I sought the LORD, and he @) me, and delivered me from all my

34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and @ faces were
not ashamed.

34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD @) him, and saved him out of
all his troubles.

34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round @+ them that fear him,
and delivereth them.

34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.

34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for @ is no want to them that
fear him.

34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
the LORD @ not want any good @7.

34:11 Come, ye @, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of
the LORD.

34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
may see good?

34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from @King guile.

34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek @U, and pursue it.

34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the @ceous, and his ears are
open unto @ cry.

34:16 The face of the LORD is @
 them that do evil, to cut off
the remembrance of them from the @.

34:17 The @ceous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
of all @ troubles.

34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken @; and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

34:19 Many are the afflictions of the @ceous: but the LORD
delivereth him out of them all.

34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

34:21 Evil @ slay the wicked: and they that hate the @ceous
@ be desolate.

34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his @<s: and none of them
that trust in him @ be desolate.



35:1 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
@
 them that fight @

35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way @
 them that
persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

35:4 Let them be con@Ved and put to shame that seek @ my soul:
let them be turned back and @ to confusion that devise my hurt.

35:5 Let them be as chaff @	 the wind: and let the angel of the

35:6 Let @ way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD

35:7 For @S cause have they hid for me @ net in a pit, @
@S cause they have digged for my soul.

35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that

35:9 And my soul @ be joyful in the LORD: it @ rejoice in his

35:10 All my bones @ say, LORD, who is like unto thee, @
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor
and the needy from him that spoileth him?

35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge @ that
I knew not.

35:12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clo@7 was sackcloth: I
humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own
bosom.

35:14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or @X: I
bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his m@C.

35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and ga@d @T
@?: yea, the abjects ga@d @T @? @

and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:

35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
@ teeth.

35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from @
destructions, my darling from the lions.

35:18 I will give thee thanks in the @ @`: I will praise
thee @ much @.

35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
@" let them wink with the eye that hate me @S a cause.

35:20 For they @K not @U: but they devise deceitful matters
@
 them that are quiet in the land.

35:21 Yea, they opened @ @P wide @

aha, our eye hath seen it.

35:22 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
far from me.

35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
my God and my Lord.

35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, @$ to thy @ceousness; and let
them not rejoice over me.

35:25 Let them not say in @ @s, Ah, so @L we have it: let

35:26 Let them be ashamed and @ to confusion @? that
rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour
that magnify @T @
 me.

35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my @ceous
cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, @
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his @<.

35:28 And my tongue @ @K of thy @ceousness and of thy praise
all the day long.



36:1 The transgression of the wicked @
 within my @, that @
is no fear of God @	 his eyes.

36:2 For he flattereth @9 in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
@V to be hateful.

36:3 The @5 of his @P are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off
to be wise, and to do good.

36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth @9 in a way
that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the @1s; and thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds.

36:6 Thy @ceousness is like the @ mountains; thy judgments are
a @ deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! @fore the
@ of men put @ trust @[ the shadow of thy wings.

36:8 They @ be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy @;
and thou @ make them @b of the river of thy pleasures.

36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light @ we see
light.

36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
@ceousness to the up@c in @.

36:11 Let not the foot of pride come @
 me, and let not the hand
of the wicked remove me.

36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
and @ not be able to rise.



37:1 Fret not thyself @ of evildoers, @" be thou envious
@
 the workers of iniquity.

37:2 For they @ soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
green herb.

37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so @ thou dwell in the land,
and verily thou @ be fed.

37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he @ give thee the
desires of @ @.

37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he @

37:6 And he @ @( @ thy @ceousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday.

37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
@ of him who prospereth in his way, @ of the man who
@(eth wicked devices to pass.

37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise
to do evil.

37:9 For evildoers @ be cut off: but @J that wait upon the
LORD, they @ inherit the @.

37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked @ not be: yea, thou
@ diligently consider his @', and it @ not be.

37:11 But the meek @ inherit the @; and @ delight
@T in the abundance of @U.

37:12 The wicked plotteth @
 the just, and gnasheth upon him with
his teeth.

37:13 The LORD @ laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
coming.

37:14 The wicked have drawn out the @Q, and have bent @ bow, to
cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of up@c
conversation.

37:15 Their @Q @ enter into @ own @, and @ bows
@ be broken.

37:16 A little that a @ceous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked.

37:17 For the arms of the wicked @ be broken: but the LORD
upholdeth the @ceous.

37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the up@c: and @ inheritance
@ be for ever.

37:19 They @ not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
famine they @ be satisfied.

37:20 But the wicked @ perish, and the enemies of the LORD @
be as the fat of lambs: they @ consume; into smoke @ they
consume away.

37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not @*: but the @ceous
sheweth mercy, and giveth.

37:22 For such as be blessed of him @ inherit the @; and they
that be cursed of him @ be cut off.

37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
delighteth in his way.

37:24 Though he fall, he @ not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
upholdeth him with his hand.

37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
@ceous forsaken, nor his seed begging @d.

37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they
are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked @ be cut off.

37:29 The @ceous @ inherit the land, and dwell @in for

37:30 The @P of the @ceous @Keth wisdom, and his tongue
talketh of judgment.

37:31 The law of his God is in his @; none of his steps @
slide.

37:32 The wicked watcheth the @ceous, and seeketh to slay him.

37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he
is judged.

37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he @ exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou @ see it.

37:35 I have seen the wicked in @ power, and spreading @9
like a green bay tree.

37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
he could not be @V.

37:37 Mark the perfect man, and @% the up@c: for the end of
that man is @U.

37:38 But the transgressors @ be destroyed @?: the end of
the wicked @ be cut off.

37:39 But the salvation of the @ceous is of the LORD: he is @
strength in the time of trouble.

37:40 And the LORD @ help them, and deliver them: he @ deliver
them from the wicked, and save them, @ they trust in him.



38:1 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: @" chasten me in thy hot

38:2 For @ arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

38:3 There is no soundness in my @R @ of @ anger; @"

38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden

38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt @ of my foolishness.

38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down @ly; I go mourning all the day

38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my @.

38:9 Lord, all my desire is @	 thee; and my groaning is not hid
from thee.

38:10 My @ panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
kinsmen stand afar off.

38:12 They also that seek @ my life lay snares for me: and they
that seek my hurt @K mischievous @, and imagine deceits all
the day long.

38:13 But I, as a deaf man, @) not; and I was as a dumb man that
openeth not his @P.

38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose @P are no
reproofs.

38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest @Cwise they @# rejoice over me:
when my foot slippeth, they magnify @T @
 me.

38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually @	 me.

38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that
hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
@ I follow the @7 that good is.

38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.



39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue: I will keep my @P with a bridle, while the wicked is @	
me.

39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my @U, even from good; and my
sorrow was stirred.

39:3 My @ was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:
then @0 I with my tongue,

39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what
it is: that I may know how frail I am.

39:5 @., thou hast made my days as an hand@dth; and mine age is
as no@7 @	 thee: verily @ man at his best state is
al@? vanity.

Selah.

39:6 Surely @ man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who @
gather them.

39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
of the foolish.

39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my @P; @ thou didst it.

39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
@ hand.

39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely @ man is
vanity. Selah.

39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
@U at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as
all my @s were.

39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, @	 I go hence, and
be no more.



40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
@) my cry.

40:2 He @ me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

40:3 And he hath put a new song in my @P, even praise unto our God:
many @ see it, and fear, and @ trust in the LORD.

40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works @ thou hast
done, and thy thoughts @ are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee: if I @L declare and @K of them, they are
more than can be numbered.

40:6 Sacrifice and @& thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
opened: @_ @& and sin @& hast thou not required.

40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
of me,

40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
@.

40:9 I have preached @ceousness in the @ @`: lo, I
have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

40:10 I have not hid thy @ceousness within my @; I have
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the @ @`.

40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me @+: mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are
more than the hairs of mine head: @fore my @ faileth me.

40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
me.

40:14 Let them be ashamed and con@Ved @? that seek @ my
soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil.

40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of @ shame that say unto
me, Aha, aha.

40:16 Let all @J that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art
my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.



41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
him in time of trouble.

41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he @ be
blessed upon the @: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies.

41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
sinned @
 thee.

41:5 Mine enemies @K evil of me, When @ he die, and his name
perish?

41:6 And if he come to see me, he @Keth vanity: his @ ga@th
iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.

41:7 All that hate me whisper @? @
 me: @
 me do they
devise my hurt.

41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that
he lieth he @ rise up no more.

41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, @ did eat
of my @d, hath lifted up his heel @
 me.

41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them.

41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, @ mine enemy doth
not triumph over me.

41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest
me @	 thy face for ever.

41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of @ from everlasting, and to
everlasting. Amen, and Amen.



42:1 As the hart panteth @ the @Z brooks, so panteth my soul
@ thee, O God.

42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when @ I come
and appear @	 God?

42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
say unto me, Where is thy God?

42:4 When I remember @ @, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
gone with the multitude, I went with them to the @ of God, with
the @; of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
me?  hope thou in God: for I @ yet praise him for the help of his
countenance.

42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: @fore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
hill Mizar.

42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy @Zspouts: all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me.

42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
in the night his song @ be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
my life.

42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
mourning @ of the oppression of the enemy?

42:10 As with a @Q in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope thou in God: for I @ yet praise him, who is the
health of my countenance, and my God.



43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause @
 an ungodly nation: O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?
why go I mourning @ of the oppression of the enemy?

43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
@( me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

43:4 Then will I go unto the @\ of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope in God: for I @ yet praise him, who is the health
of my countenance, and my God.



44:1 We have @) with our ears, O God, our @s have told us,
what work thou didst in @ days, in the times of old.

44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
them; how thou didst afflict the @, and cast them out.

44:3 For they got not the land in possession by @ own @Q,
@" did @ own arm save them: but thy @c hand, and @
arm, and the light of thy countenance, @ thou hadst a favour
unto them.

44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for @].

44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: @E thy name will
we tread them @[ that rise up @

44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, @" @ my @Q save me.

44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
shame that hated us.

44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.

Selah.

44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not @
with our armies.

44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they @ hate
us spoil for @T.

44:11 Thou hast @= us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
scattered us @ the heathen.

44:12 Thou sellest thy @ for nought, and dost not increase thy
wealth by @ price.

44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
derision to them that are round @+ us.

44:14 Thou makest us a byword @ the heathen, a shaking of the head
@ the @.

44:15 My confusion is continually @	 me, and the shame of my face
hath covered me,

44:16 For the @; of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
of the enemy and avenger.

44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
@" have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

44:18 Our @ is not turned back, @" have our steps declined
from thy way;

44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the @' of dragons, and
covered us with the shadow of @^.

44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
@D to a strange god;

44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
@.

44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter.

44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
ever.

44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
and our oppression?

44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto
the @.

44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.



45:1 My @ is inditing a good matter: I @K of the @ @ I
have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

45:2 Thou art fairer than the @ of men: grace is poured into
thy lips: @fore God hath blessed thee for ever.

45:3 Gird thy @Q upon thy thigh, O most @By, with thy @Y and
thy majesty.

45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously @ of truth and
meekness and @ceousness; and thy @c hand @ teach thee
terrible @.

45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the @ of the king's enemies;
whereby the @ fall @[ thee.

45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
kingdom is a @c sceptre.

45:7 Thou lovest @ceousness, and hatest wickedness: @fore God,
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

45:9 Kings' daughters were @ thy honourable women: upon thy @c
hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline @ ear; forget
also @ own @, and thy @'s @;

45:11 So @ the king @ly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;
and worship thou him.

45:12 And the daughter of Tyre @ be @ with a gift; even the
rich @ the @ @ intreat thy favour.

45:13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clo@7 is of
wrought gold.

45:14 She @ be @ unto the king in raiment of needlework: the
virgins her companions that follow her @ be @ unto thee.

45:15 With gladness and rejoicing @ they be @: they @
enter into the king's palace.

45:16 Instead of thy @s @ be thy @, whom thou mayest
make princes in all the @.

45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
@fore @ the @ praise thee for ever and ever.



46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

46:2 @N will not we fear, though the @ be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the @a of the sea;

46:3 Though the @Zs @of roar and be troubled, though the
mountains shake with the swelling @of. Selah.

46:4 There is a river, the streams whereof @ make glad the city of
God, the holy @' of the tabernacles of the most High.

46:5 God is in the @a of her; she @ not be moved: God @

46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his @;,
the @ melted.

46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of @] is our refuge.
Selah.

46:8 Come, @% the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
in the @.

46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the @; he breaketh
the bow, and cutteth the spear in s@[; he burneth the chariot in
the fire.

46:10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted @ the
heathen, I will be exalted in the @.

46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of @] is our refuge.
Selah.



47:1 O clap your @D, all ye @; shout unto God with the @;
of triumph.

47:2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a @ King over all
the @.

47:3 He @ subdue the @ @[ us, and the nations @[ our

47:4 He @ choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of @]
whom he loved. Selah.

47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
trumpet.

47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
sing praises.

47:7 For God is the King of all the @: sing ye praises with
@[standing.

47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
holiness.

47:9 The princes of the @ are ga@d @?, even the @
of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the @ belong unto God:
he is @ly exalted.



48:1 Great is the LORD, and @ly to be praised in the city of our
God, in the mountain of his holiness.

48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole @, is mount
Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the @ King.

48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by @?.

48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
hasted away.

48:6 Fear took hold upon them @, and pain, as of a woman in
travail.

48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

48:8 As we have @), so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the @a of thy
temple.

48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of
the @: thy @c hand is full of @ceousness.

48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of @ be glad,
@ of thy judgments.

48:12 Walk @+ Zion, and go round @+ her: tell the towers
@of.

48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
tell it to the generation following.

48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
even unto @^.



49:1 Hear this, all ye @; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
world:

49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, @?.

49:3 My @P @ @K of wisdom; and the meditation of my @

49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark @

49:5 Wherefore @# I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
my heels @ compass me @+?

49:6 They that trust in @ wealth, and boast @T in the
multitude of @ riches;

49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his @X, nor give to God
a ransom for him:

49:8 (For the redemption of @ soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
ever:)

49:9 That he @# still live for ever, and not see corruption.

49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
brutish person perish, and leave @ wealth to @Cs.

49:11 Their inward thought is, that @ @s @ continue for
ever, and @ dwelling @'s to all generations; they call @
lands @ @ own names.

49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
beasts that perish.

49:13 This @ way is @ folly: yet @ posterity approve @
@s. Selah.

49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; @^ @ feed on them;
and the up@c @ have dominion over them in the morning; and
@ beauty @ consume in the grave from @ dwelling.

49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
@ receive me. Selah.

49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the @Y of his
@ is increased;

49:17 For when he dieth he @ carry no@7 away: his @Y @
not descend @ him.

49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

49:19 He @ go to the generation of his @s; they @ never
see light.

49:20 Man that is in honour, and @[standeth not, is like the beasts

50:1 The @By God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and @, the @
from the rising of the sun unto the going down @of.

50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

50:3 Our God @ come, and @ not keep silence: a fire @

50:4 He @ call to the @1s from above, and to the @, that
he may judge his @.

50:5 Gather my saints @? unto me; @J that have made a

50:6 And the @1s @ declare his @ceousness: for God is judge
@9. Selah.

50:7 Hear, O my @, and I will @K; O @, and I will testify
@
 thee: I am God, even thy God.

50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy @_
@&s, to have been continually @	 me.

50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy @, nor he goats out of thy
folds.

50:10 For @ beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
@: hills.

50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
the field are mine.

50:12 If I were hungry, I @L not tell thee: for the world is mine,
and the fulness @of.

50:13 Will I eat the @R of bulls, or @b the @I of goats?

50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
High:

50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou @ glorify me.

50:16 But unto the wicked God @
, What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes, or that thou @#est take my covenant in thy @P?

50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my @5 behind
thee.

50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers.

50:19 Thou givest thy @P to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

50:20 Thou sittest and @Kest @
 thy @X; thou slanderest
@ own m@C's son.

50:21 These @ hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was al@? such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,
and set them in order @	 @ eyes.

50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
pieces, and @ be none to deliver.

50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation a@c will I shew the salvation of God.



51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, @$ to thy lovingkindness:
@$ unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions.

51:2 Wash me @Ely from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever @	
me.

51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight: that thou @Best be justified when thou @Kest, and be
clear when thou judgest.

51:5 @., I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my m@C
conceive me.

51:6 @., thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
hidden part thou @ make me to know wisdom.

51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I @ be clean: wash me, and I @

51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones @ thou hast
broken may rejoice.

51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

51:10 Create in me a clean @, O God; and renew a @c spirit

51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
from me.

51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit.

51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners @ be
converted unto thee.

51:14 Deliver me from @Iguiltiness, O God, thou God of my

51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my @P @ shew @ thy

51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else @L I give it: thou

51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite @, O God, thou wilt not despise.

51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of

51:19 Then @ thou be pleased with the sacrifices of @ceousness,

52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O @By man? the goodness

52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully.

52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to @K
@ceousness. Selah.

52:4 Thou lovest all devouring @5, O thou deceitful tongue.

52:5 God @ likewise destroy thee for ever, he @ take thee
away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling @', and root thee out of
the land of the living. Selah.

52:6 The @ceous also @ see, and fear, and @ laugh at him:

52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened @9 in his
wickedness.

52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the @ of God: I trust in
the mercy of God for ever and ever.

52:9 I will praise thee for ever, @ thou hast done it: and I
will wait on thy name; for it is good @	 thy saints.



53:1 The fool hath said in his @, There is no God. Corrupt are
they, and have done abominable iniquity: @ is none that doeth
good.

53:2 God looked down from @1 upon the @ of men, to see if
@ were any that did @[stand, that did seek God.

53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are al@? become
filthy; @ is none that doeth good, no, not one.

53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my @
as they eat @d: they have not @, upon God.

53:5 There were they in @ fear, where no fear was: for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth @
 thee: thou hast put
them to shame, @ God hath despised them.

53:6 Oh that the salvation of @ were come out of Zion! When God
@(eth back the captivity of his @, @] @ rejoice, and
@ @ be glad.



54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the @5 of my @P.

54:3 For strangers are risen up @
 me, and oppressors seek @
my soul: they have not set God @	 them. Selah.

54:4 @., God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul.

54:5 He @ reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
truth.

54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
LORD; for it is good.

54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies.



55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
supplication.

55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
noise;

55:3 Because of the @; of the enemy, @ of the oppression of
the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

55:4 My @ is sore pained within me: and the terrors of @^ are
fallen upon me.

55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me.

55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then @L I fly
away, and be at rest.

55:7 Lo, then @L I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
Selah.

55:8 I @L hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide @ tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city.

55:10 Day and night they go @+ it upon the walls @of: mischief
also and sorrow are in the @a of it.

55:11 Wickedness is in the @a @of: deceit and guile depart not
from her streets.

55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
borne it: @" was it he that hated me that did magnify @9
@
 me; then I @L have hid myself from him:

55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance.

55:14 We took sweet counsel @?, and walked unto the @ of God
in company.

55:15 Let @^ seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
for wickedness is in @ dwellings, and @ them.

55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD @ save me.

55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and he @ hear my @;.

55:18 He hath delivered my soul in @U from the battle that was
@
 me: for @ were many with me.

55:19 God @ hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.

Selah. Because they have no changes, @fore they fear not God.

55:20 He hath put @ his @D @
 such as be at @U with
him: he hath broken his covenant.

55:21 The @5 of his @P were smo@C than butter, but war was in
his @: his @5 were softer than oil, yet were they drawn @Qs.

55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he @ sustain thee: he
@ never suffer the @ceous to be moved.

55:23 But thou, O God, @ @( them down into the pit of
destruction: @Iy and deceitful men @ not live out half @
days; but I will trust in thee.



56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man @L swallow me up; he
fighting daily oppresseth me.

56:2 Mine enemies @L daily swallow me up: for they be many that
fight @
 me, O thou most High.

56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
not fear what @R can do unto me.

56:5 Every day they wrest my @5: all @ thoughts are @
 me
for evil.

56:6 They gather @T @?, they hide @T, they mark
my steps, when they wait for my soul.

56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in @ anger cast down the
@, O God.

56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
are they not in thy book?

56:9 When I cry unto thee, then @ mine enemies turn back: this I
know; for God is for me.

56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
word.

56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
unto me.

56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from @^: wilt not thou
deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk @	 God in the light
of the living?



57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
refuge, until @ calamities be overpast.

57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
@ for me.

57:3 He @ send from @1, and save me from the reproach of him
that @L swallow me up. Selah. God @ send @ his mercy and
his truth.

57:4 My soul is @ lions: and I lie even @ them that are set on
fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
@ tongue a sharp @Q.

57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the @1s; let thy @Y be above
all the @.

57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
they have digged a pit @	 me, into the @a whereof they are
fallen @T. Selah.

57:7 My @ is fixed, O God, my @ is fixed: I will sing and give
praise.

57:8 Awake up, my @Y; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early.

57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, @ the @: I will sing unto
thee @ the nations.

57:10 For thy mercy is @ unto the @1s, and thy truth unto the
clouds.

57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the @1s: let thy @Y be
above all the @.



58:1 Do ye indeed @K @ceousness, O @`? do ye judge
up@cly, O ye sons of men?

58:2 Yea, in @ ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your
@D in the @.

58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
they be born, @King lies.

58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

58:5 Which will not hearken to the @; of charmers, charming never
so wisely.

58:6 Break @ teeth, O God, in @ @P: break out the @
teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

58:7 Let them melt away as @Zs @ run continually: when he
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

58:8 As a snail @ melteth, let @ one of them pass away: like
the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he @ take them away as
with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

58:10 The @ceous @ rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
@ wash his feet in the @I of the wicked.

58:11 So that a man @ say, Verily @ is a reward for the
@ceous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the @.



59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that
rise up @
 me.

59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from @Iy
men.

59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the @By are ga@d
@
 me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

59:4 They run and prepare @T @S my fault: awake to help
me, and @%.

59:5 Thou @fore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of @, awake to
visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.
Selah.

59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
round @+ the city.

59:7 @., they belch out with @ @P: @Qs are in @
lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

59:8 But thou, O LORD, @ laugh at them; thou @ have all the
heathen in derision.

59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
defence.

59:10 The God of my mercy @ prevent me: God @ let me see my
desire upon mine enemies.

59:11 Slay them not, lest my @ forget: scatter them by thy power;
and @( them down, O Lord our shield.

59:12 For the sin of @ @P and the @5 of @ lips let them
even be taken in @ pride: and for cursing and lying @ they
@K.

59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
let them know that God ruleth in @] unto the ends of the @.
Selah.

59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
dog, and go round @+ the city.

59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
satisfied.

59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the
day of my trouble.

59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
and the God of my mercy.



60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast
been displeased; O turn thyself to us @*.

60:2 Thou hast made the @ to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
the breaches @of; for it shaketh.

60:3 Thou hast shewed thy @ hard @: thou hast made us to
@b the wine of astonishment.

60:4 Thou hast @= a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed @ of the truth. Selah.

60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy @c hand, and
hear me.

60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
strength of mine head; @ is my lawgiver;

60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
triumph thou @ of me.

60:9 Who will @( me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?

60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, @ hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
@ didst not go out with our armies?

60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

60:12 Through God we @ do valiantly: for he it is that @ tread
down our enemies.



61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

61:2 From the end of the @ will I cry unto thee, when my @ is
overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
enemy.

61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
covert of thy wings. Selah.

61:5 For thou, O God, hast @) my vows: thou hast @= me the
heritage of @J that fear thy name.

61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his @8 as many
generations.

61:7 He @ abide @	 God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
@ may preserve him.

61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
perform my vows.



62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I @
not be @ly moved.

62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief @
 a man? ye @ be
slain all of you: as a bowing wall @ ye be, and as a tottering
fence.

62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
delight in lies: they bless with @ @P, but they curse inwardly.
Selah.

62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I @
not be moved.

62:7 In God is my salvation and my @Y: the rock of my strength, and
my refuge, is in God.

62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye @, pour out your @ @	
him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
lie: to be laid in the balance, they are al@? lighter than
vanity.

62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
riches increase, set not your @ upon them.

62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I @) this; that power
belongeth unto God.

62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
@ man @$ to his work.



63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
for thee, my @R longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where
no @Z is;

63:2 To see thy power and thy @Y, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary.

63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips @
praise thee.

63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my @D in
thy name.

63:5 My soul @ be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
@P @ praise thee with joyful lips:

63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
night watches.

63:7 Because thou hast been my help, @fore in the shadow of thy
wings will I rejoice.

63:8 My soul followeth hard @ thee: thy @c hand upholdeth me.

63:9 But @J that seek my soul, to destroy it, @ go into the
lower parts of the @.

63:10 They @ fall by the @Q: they @ be a portion for foxes.

63:11 But the king @ rejoice in God; @ one that sweareth by
him @ @Y: but the @P of them that @K lies @ be
stopped.



64:1 Hear my @;, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
the enemy.

64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

64:3 Who whet @ tongue like a @Q, and bend @ bows to shoot
@ arrows, even bitter @5:

64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
shoot at him, and fear not.

64:5 They encourage @T in an evil matter: they commune of
laying snares privily; they say, Who @ see them?

64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
both the inward thought of @ one of them, and the @, is deep.

64:7 But God @ shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly @ they be
wounded.

64:8 So they @ make @ own tongue to fall upon @T: all
that see them @ flee away.

64:9 And all men @ fear, and @ declare the work of God; for
they @ wisely consider of his doing.

64:10 The @ceous @ be glad in the LORD, and @ trust in him;
and all the up@c in @ @ @Y.



65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee @ the
vow be performed.

65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee @ all @R come.

65:3 Iniquities prevail @
 me: as for our transgressions, thou
@ purge them away.

65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we @ be satisfied with
the goodness of thy @, even of thy holy temple.

65:5 By terrible @ in @ceousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the @,
and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
with power:

65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of @ waves,
and the tumult of the @.

65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
rejoice.

65:9 Thou visitest the @, and @Zest it: thou @ly enrichest
it with the river of God, @ is full of @Z: thou preparest them
corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

65:10 Thou @Zest the ridges @of abundantly: thou settlest the
furrows @of: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the
springing @of.

65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
fatness.

65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
hills rejoice on @ side.

65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.



66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

66:2 Sing @ the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! @E the
@ness of thy power @ @ enemies submit @T unto
thee.

66:4 All the @ @ worship thee, and @ sing unto thee; they
@ sing to thy name. Selah.

66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward
the @ of men.

66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went @E the flood on
foot: @ did we rejoice in him.

66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes @% the nations: let
not the rebellious exalt @T. Selah.

66:8 O bless our God, ye @, and make the @; of his praise to
be @):

66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
moved.

66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
is tried.

66:11 Thou @est us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
loins.

66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went @E
fire and @E @Z: but thou @est us out into a wealthy
@'.

66:13 I will go into thy @ with @_ @&s: I will pay thee
my vows,

66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my @P hath spoken, when I was
in trouble.

66:15 I will offer unto thee @_ sacrifices of fatlings, with the
incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
hath done for my soul.

66:17 I cried unto him with my @P, and he was extolled with my
tongue.

66:18 If I regard iniquity in my @, the Lord will not hear me:

66:19 But verily God hath @) me; he hath attended to the @; of
my prayer.

66:20 Blessed be God, @ hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
mercy from me.



67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
shine upon us; Selah.

67:2 That thy way may be known upon @, thy saving health @ all
nations.

67:3 Let the @ praise thee, O God; let all the @ praise
thee.

67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou @ judge
the @ @ceously, and govern the nations upon @. Selah.

67:5 Let the @ praise thee, O God; let all the @ praise

67:6 Then @ the @ yield her increase; and God, even our own
God, @ bless us.

67:7 God @ bless us; and all the ends of the @ @ fear him.



68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that
hate him flee @	 him.

68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
@	 the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

68:3 But let the @ceous be glad; let them rejoice @	 God: yea,
let them exceedingly rejoice.

68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
upon the @1s by his name JAH, and rejoice @	 him.

68:5 A @ of the @less, and a judge of the widows, is God in
his holy habitation.

68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he @(eth out @J @
are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

68:7 O God, when thou wentest @ @	 thy @, when thou didst
march @E the wilderness; Selah:

68:8 The @ shook, the @1s also dropped at the presence of God:
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of @.

68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
confirm @ inheritance, when it was weary.

68:10 Thy @` hath dwelt @in: thou, O God, hast prepared
of thy goodness for the poor.

68:11 The Lord gave the word: @ was the company of @J that
published it.

68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
divided the spoil.

68:13 Though ye have lien @ the pots, yet @ ye be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

68:14 When the Al@By scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
Salmon.

68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
hill of Bashan.

68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill @ God desireth
to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

68:17 The chariots of God are twenty @:, even @:s of
angels: the Lord is @ them, as in Sinai, in the holy @'.

68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that
the LORD God @B dwell @ them.

68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
the God of our salvation. Selah.

68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
Lord belong the issues from @^.

68:21 But God @ wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

68:22 The Lord said, I will @( @* from Bashan, I will @( my
@ @* from the depths of the sea:

68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the @I of @ enemies, and
the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
King, in the sanctuary.

68:25 The singers went @	, the players on instruments followed
@; @ them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

68:26 Bless ye God in the @`s, even the Lord, from the
fountain of @.

68:27 There is little Benjamin with @ ruler, the princes of @
and @ council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
Naphtali.

68:28 Thy God hath @M thy strength: strengthen, O God, that

68:29 Because of thy temple at @  @ kings @( presents

68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with
the calves of the @, till @ one submit @9 with pieces of
silver: scatter thou the @ that delight in war.

68:31 Princes @ come out of @-; Ethiopia @ soon stretch out
her @D unto God.

68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the @; O sing praises unto the
Lord; Selah:

68:33 To him that rideth upon the @1s of @1s, @ were of
old; lo, he doth send out his @;, and that a @By @;.

68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over @, and
his strength is in the clouds.

68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy @'s: the God of
@ is he that giveth strength and power unto his @. Blessed
be God.



69:1 Save me, O God; for the @Zs are come in unto my soul.

69:2 I sink in deep mire, where @ is no standing: I am come into
deep @Zs, where the floods overflow me.

69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God.

69:4 They that hate me @S a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head: they that @L destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are
@By: then I restored that @ I took not away.

69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
thee.

69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
for my sake: let not @J that seek thee be con@Ved for my sake, O
God of @.

69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
face.

69:8 I am become a stranger unto my @3, and an alien unto my
m@C's @.

69:9 For the zeal of @ @ hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
reproach.

69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
them.

69:12 They that sit in the gate @K @
 me; and I was the song
of the drunkards.

69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of
thy salvation.

69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep @Zs.

69:15 Let not the @Zflood overflow me, @" let the deep swallow
me up, and let not the pit shut her @P upon me.

69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
@$ to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

69:17 And hide not thy face from thy @<; for I am in trouble:
hear me speedily.

69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me @ of
mine enemies.

69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
mine adversaries are all @	 thee.

69:20 Reproach hath broken my @; and I am full of heaviness: and I
looked for some to take pity, but @ was none; and for comforters,
but I @V none.

69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to @b.

69:22 Let @ table become a snare @	 them: and that @
@# have been for @ welfare, let it become a trap.

69:23 Let @ eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make @
loins continually to shake.

69:24 Pour out @ indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them.

69:25 Let @ habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in @
tents.

69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
the grief of @J whom thou hast wounded.

69:27 Add iniquity unto @ iniquity: and let them not come into thy
@ceousness.

69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
written with the @ceous.

69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up
on high.

69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
with thanksgiving.

69:31 This also @ please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs.

69:32 The humble @ see this, and be glad: and your @ @
live that seek God.

69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

69:34 Let the @1 and @ praise him, the seas, and @ @7
that moveth @in.

69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the @G of @: that
they may dwell @, and have it in possession.

69:36 The seed also of his @<s @ inherit it: and they that
love his name @ dwell @in.



70:1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.

70:2 Let them be ashamed and con@Ved that seek @ my soul: let
them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of @ shame that say,
Aha, aha.

70:4 Let all @J that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my
help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.



71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
confusion.

71:2 Deliver me in thy @ceousness, and cause me to escape: incline
@ ear unto me, and save me.

71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
thou hast @= commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my
fortress.

71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
hand of the un@ceous and cruel man.

71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
youth.

71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
took me out of my m@C's bowels: my praise @ be continually of
thee.

71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

71:8 Let my @P be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day.

71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
strength faileth.

71:10 For mine enemies @K @
 me; and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel @?,

71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for @
is none to deliver him.

71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

71:13 Let them be con@Ved and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt.

71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
more.

71:15 My @P @ shew @ thy @ceousness and thy salvation
all the day; for I know not the numbers @of.

71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
of thy @ceousness, even of @ only.

71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
declared thy wondrous works.

71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power
to @ one that is to come.

71:19 Thy @ceousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done @
@: O God, who is like unto thee!

71:20 Thou, @ hast shewed me @ and sore troubles, @
quicken me @*, and @ @( me up @* from the depths of the
@.

71:21 Thou @ increase my @ness, and comfort me on @ side.

71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of @.

71:23 My lips @ @ly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
soul, @ thou hast redeemed.

71:24 My tongue also @ talk of thy @ceousness all the day long:
for they are con@Ved, for they are @ unto shame, that seek my
hurt.



72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy @ceousness unto
the king's son.

72:2 He @ judge thy @ with @ceousness, and thy poor with
judgment.

72:3 The mountains @ @( @U to the @, and the little

72:4 He @ judge the poor of the @, he @ save the @

72:5 They @ fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,

72:6 He @ come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that

72:7 In his days @ the @ceous flourish; and abundance of @U

72:8 He @ have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river

72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness @ bow @	 him; and his

72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles @ @( presents: the
kings of Sheba and Seba @ offer gifts.

72:11 Yea, all kings @ fall down @	 him: all nations @

72:12 For he @ deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
and him that hath no helper.

72:13 He @ spare the poor and needy, and @ save the souls of
the needy.

72:14 He @ redeem @ soul from deceit and violence: and
precious @ @ @I be in his sight.

72:15 And he @ live, and to him @ be @= of the gold of

72:16 There @ be an handful of corn in the @ upon the top of

the city @ flourish like grass of the @.

72:17 His name @ endure for ever: his name @ be continued as

72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of @, who only doeth
wondrous @.

72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
@ be filled with his @Y; Amen, and Amen.

72:20 The prayers of @ the son of Jesse are ended.



73:1 Truly God is good to @, even to such as are of a clean
@.

73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
slipped.

73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
the wicked.

73:4 For @ are no bands in @ @^: but @ strength is
firm.

73:5 They are not in trouble as @C men; @" are they plagued
like @C men.

73:6 @N pride compasseth them @+ as a chain; violence
covereth them as a garment.

73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than @
could wish.

73:8 They are corrupt, and @K wickedly concerning oppression: they
@K loftily.

73:9 They set @ @P @
 the @1s, and @ tongue
walketh @E the @.

73:10 @N his @ return hither: and @Zs of a full cup are
wrung out to them.

73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is @ knowledge in the
most High?

73:12 @., @ are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
increase in riches.

73:13 Verily I have cleansed my @ in vain, and washed my @D in
innocency.

73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened @
morning.

73:15 If I say, I will @K thus; @%, I @# offend @
 the
generation of thy @.

73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then @[stood I @
end.

73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery @'s: thou castedst
them down into destruction.

73:19 How are they @ into desolation, as in a moment! they are
utterly consumed with terrors.

73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
@ despise @ image.

73:21 Thus my @ was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast @	 thee.

73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by
my @c hand.

73:24 Thou @ guide me with thy counsel, and @ward receive me
to @Y.

73:25 Whom have I in @1 but thee? and @ is none upon @
that I desire beside thee.

73:26 My @R and my @ faileth: but God is the strength of my
@, and my portion for ever.

73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee @ perish: thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.



74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth @ anger
smoke @
 the sheep of thy pasture?

74:2 Remember thy @`, @ thou hast purchased of old; the
rod of @ inheritance, @ thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
wherein thou hast dwelt.

74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

74:4 Thine enemies roar in the @a of thy @`s; they set up
@ ensigns for signs.

74:5 A man was famous @$ as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees.

74:6 But now they break down the carved work @of at once with axes
and hammers.

74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling @' of thy name to the ground.

74:8 They said in @ @s, Let us destroy them @?: they
have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

74:9 We see not our signs: @ is no more any prophet: @" is
@ @ us any that knoweth how long.

74:10 O God, how long @ the adversary reproach? @ the enemy
blaspheme thy name for ever?

74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy @c hand? pluck it out
of thy bosom.

74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the @a of the
@.

74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the @Zs.

74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
be meat to the @ inhabiting the wilderness.

74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
@By rivers.

74:16 The day is @, the night also is @: thou hast prepared
the light and the sun.

74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the @: thou hast made
summer and winter.

74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
the foolish @ have blasphemed thy name.

74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
the wicked: forget not the @` of thy poor for ever.

74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark @'s of the @
are full of the habitations of cruelty.

74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
praise thy name.

74:22 Arise, O God, plead @ own cause: remember how the foolish
man reproacheth thee daily.

74:23 Forget not the @; of @ enemies: the tumult of @J that
rise up @
 thee increaseth continually.



75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

75:2 When I @ receive the @` I will judge up@cly.

75:3 The @ and all the inhabitants @of are dissolved: I bear
up the pillars of it. Selah.

75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
Lift not up the horn:

75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: @K not with a stiff neck.

75:6 For promotion cometh @" from the east, nor from the west,
nor from the south.

75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
@F.

75:8 For in the hand of the LORD @ is a cup, and the wine is red;
it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs
@of, all the wicked of the @ @ wring them out, and @b
them.

75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
@].

75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
of the @ceous @ be exalted.



76:1 In @ is God known: his name is @ in @.

76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling @' in Zion.

76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the @Q,
and the battle. Selah.

76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

76:5 The stout@ed are spoiled, they have slept @ sleep: and
none of the men of @B have @V @ @D.

76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of @], both the chariot and horse are
cast into a dead sleep.

76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry?

76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be @) from @1; the @
feared, and was still,

76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the @.
Selah.

76:10 Surely the wrath of man @ praise thee: the remainder of
wrath @ thou restrain.

76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round @+
him @( presents unto him that ought to be feared.

76:12 He @ cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
kings of the @.



77:1 I cried unto God with my @;, even unto God with my @;; and
he gave ear unto me.

77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit
was overwhelmed. Selah.

77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
@K.

77:5 I have considered the days of old, the @8 of ancient times.

77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine
own @: and my spirit made diligent search.

77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
more?

77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
evermore?

77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
tender mercies? Selah.

77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the @8
of the @c hand of the most High.

77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
thy wonders of old.

77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so @ a God as
our God?

77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
strength @ the @.

77:15 Thou hast with @ arm redeemed thy @, the sons of @]
and Joseph. Selah.

77:16 The @Zs saw thee, O God, the @Zs saw thee; they were
afraid: the depths also were troubled.

77:17 The clouds poured out @Z: the skies sent out a sound: @
arrows also went abroad.

77:18 The @; of thy th@[ was in the @1: the lightnings
lightened the world: the @ trembled and shook.

77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the @ @Zs, and thy
footsteps are not known.

77:20 Thou leddest thy @ like a flock by the hand of @ and
Aaron.



78:1 Give ear, O my @, to my law: incline your ears to the @5
of my @P.

78:2 I will open my @P in a parable: I will utter dark @s of
old:

78:3 Which we have @) and known, and our @s have told us.

78:4 We will not hide them from @ @, shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his
wonderful works that he hath done.

78:5 For he established a testimony in @], and appointed a law in
@, @ he @M our @s, that they @# make them
known to @ @:

78:6 That the generation to come @B know them, even the @
@ @# be born; who @# arise and declare them to @
@:

78:7 That they @B set @ hope in God, and not forget the works
of God, but keep his commandments:

78:8 And @B not be as @ @s, a stubborn and rebellious
generation; a generation that set not @ @ a@c, and whose
spirit was not stedfast with God.

78:9 The @ of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
back in the day of battle.

78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
law;

78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

78:12 Marvellous @ did he in the sight of @ @s, in the
land of @-, in the field of Zoan.

78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass @E; and he made
the @Zs to stand as an heap.

78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
with a light of fire.

78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them @b as out
of the @ depths.

78:16 He @ streams also out of the rock, and caused @Zs to
run down like rivers.

78:17 And they sinned yet more @
 him by provoking the most High
in the wilderness.

78:18 And they tempted God in @ @ by asking meat for @
lust.

78:19 Yea, they @0 @
 God; they said, Can God furnish a table
in the wilderness?

78:20 @., he smote the rock, that the @Zs gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give @d also? can he provide @R for
his @?

78:21 @N the LORD @) this, and was wroth: so a fire was
kindled @
 @], and anger also came up @
 @;

78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation:

78:23 Though he had @M the clouds from above, and opened the
doors of @1,

78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had @= them
of the corn of @1.

78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the @1: and by his power
he @ in the south wind.

78:27 He rained @R also upon them as dust, and fea@d fowls like
as the sand of the sea:

78:28 And he let it fall in the @a of @ camp, round @+ @
habitations.

78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them @
own desire;

78:30 They were not estranged from @ lust. But while @ meat
was yet in @ @Ps,

78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
and smote down the chosen men of @.

78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
wondrous works.

78:33 @N @ days did he consume in vanity, and @ @8
in trouble.

78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
enquired early @ God.

78:35 And they remembered that God was @ rock, and the high God
@ redeemer.

78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with @ @P, and they
lied unto him with @ tongues.

78:37 For @ @ was not @c with him, @" were they
stedfast in his covenant.

78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave @ iniquity, and
destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath.

78:39 For he remembered that they were but @R; a wind that passeth
away, and cometh not @*.

78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
in the desert!

78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
of @.

78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy.

78:43 How he had wrought his signs in @-, and his wonders in the
field of Zoan.

78:44 And had turned @ rivers into @I; and @ floods, that
they could not @b.

78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies @ them, @ devoured them;
and frogs, @ destroyed them.

78:46 He gave also @ increase unto the caterpiller, and @
labour unto the locust.

78:47 He destroyed @ vines with hail, and @ sycomore trees
with frost.

78:48 He gave up @ cattle also to the hail, and @ flocks to
hot th@[bolts.

78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels @ them.

78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not @ soul from @^,
but gave @ life over to the pestilence;

78:51 And smote all the @Oborn in @-; the chief of @
strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

78:52 But made his own @ to go @ like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock.

78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed @ enemies.

78:54 And he @ them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
mountain, @ his @c hand had purchased.

78:55 He cast out the heathen also @	 them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of @ to dwell in @
tents.

78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
his testimonies:

78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like @ @s: they
were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

78:58 For they provoked him to anger with @ high @'s, and moved
him to jealousy with @ graven images.

78:59 When God @) this, he was wroth, and @ly abhorred @:

78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent @ he
@'d @ men;

78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his @Y into
the enemy's hand.

78:62 He gave his @ over also unto the @Q; and was wroth with
his inheritance.

78:63 The fire consumed @ young men; and @ maidens were not
@= to marriage.

78:64 Their @6s fell by the @Q; and @ widows made no
lamentation.

78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a @By man
that shouteth by reason of wine.

78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetual reproach.

78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim:

78:68 But chose the tribe of @, the mount Zion @ he loved.

78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the @
@ he hath established for ever.

78:70 He chose @ also his @<, and took him from the
sheepfolds:

78:71 From following the ewes @ with young he @ him to feed
@] his @, and @ his inheritance.

78:72 So he fed them @$ to the integrity of his @; and
guided them by the skilfulness of his @D.



79:1 O God, the heathen are come into @ inheritance; thy holy
temple have they defiled; they have laid @  on heaps.

79:2 The dead bodies of thy @<s have they @= to be meat unto
the fowls of the @1, the @R of thy saints unto the beasts of
the @.

79:3 Their @I have they shed like @Z round @+ @ ; and
@ was none to bury them.

79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
to them that are round @+ us.

79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? @ thy jealousy
burn like fire?

79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
upon the kingdoms that have not @, upon thy name.

79:7 For they have devoured @], and laid waste his dwelling @'.

79:8 O remember not @
 us former iniquities: let thy tender
mercies speedily prevent us: for we are @ very low.

79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the @Y of thy name: and
deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

79:10 Wherefore @# the heathen say, Where is @ God? let him be
known @ the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the @I of
thy @<s @ is shed.

79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come @	 thee; @$ to
the @ness of thy power preserve thou @J that are appointed to
die;

79:12 And render unto our neighbours @Hfold into @ bosom @
reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

79:13 So we thy @ and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
for ever: we will shew @ thy praise to all generations.



80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of @, thou that leadest Joseph like a
flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine @.

80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
and come and save us.

80:3 Turn us @*, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we @
be saved.

80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry @
 the
prayer of thy @?

80:5 Thou feedest them with the @d of tears; and givest them tears
to @b in @ measure.

80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
laugh @ @T.

80:7 Turn us @*, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
we @ be saved.

80:8 Thou hast @ a vine out of @-: thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.

80:9 Thou preparedst room @	 it, and didst cause it to take deep
root, and it filled the land.

80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
@of were like the goodly cedars.

80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
river.

80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
@ pass by the way do pluck her?

80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it.

80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from @1,
and @%, and visit this vine;

80:15 And the vineyard @ thy @c hand hath planted, and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance.

80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy @c hand, upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
upon thy name.

80:19 Turn us @*, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
we @ be saved.



81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
God of @].

81:2 Take a psalm, and @( hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
with the psaltery.

81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
our solemn feast day.

81:4 For this was a statute for @, and a law of the God of @].

81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
@E the land of @-: where I @) a language that I @[stood
not.

81:6 I removed his @#er from the burden: his @D were delivered
from the pots.

81:7 Thou @,st in trouble, and I delivered thee; I @> thee
in the secret @' of th@[: I proved thee at the @Zs of
Meribah.

Selah.

81:8 Hear, O my @, and I will testify unto thee: O @, if
thou wilt hearken unto me;

81:9 There @ no strange god be in thee; @" @ thou worship
any strange god.

81:10 I am the LORD thy God, @ @ thee out of the land of

81:11 But my @ @L not hearken to my @;; and @ @L

81:12 So I gave them up unto @ own @s' lust: and they walked
in @ own counsels.

81:13 Oh that my @ had hearkened unto me, and @ had walked
in my ways!

81:14 I @# soon have subdued @ enemies, and turned my hand
@
 @ adversaries.

81:15 The haters of the LORD @# have submitted @T unto
him: but @ time @# have endured for ever.

81:16 He @# have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
with honey out of the rock @# I have satisfied thee.



82:1 God standeth in the @` of the @By; he judgeth @
the gods.

82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
wicked? Selah.

82:3 Defend the poor and @less: do justice to the afflicted and
needy.

82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
wicked.

82:5 They know not, @" will they @[stand; they walk on in
darkness: all the @Vations of the @ are out of course.

82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are @ of the most
High.

82:7 But ye @ die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

82:8 Arise, O God, judge the @: for thou @ inherit all
nations.



83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy @U, and be not
still, O God.

83:2 For, lo, @ enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head.

83:3 They have taken crafty counsel @
 thy @, and consulted
@
 thy hidden ones.

83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
nation; that the name of @ may be no more in remembrance.

83:5 For they have consulted @? with one consent: they are
confederate @
 thee:

83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
Hagarenes;

83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre;

83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the @ of
Lot.

Selah.

83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
at the brook of Kison:

83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the @.

83:11 Make @ nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all @
princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the @s of God in
possession.

83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble @	 the
wind.

83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
mountains on fire;

83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
thy storm.

83:16 Fill @ faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
LORD.

83:17 Let them be con@Ved and troubled for ever; yea, let them be

83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
the most high over all the @.



84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
my @ and my @R crieth out for the living God.

84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath @V an @, and the swallow a nest for

84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy @: they will be still

84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose @ are

84:6 Who passing @E the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain

84:7 They go from strength to strength, @ one of them in Zion

84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of @].
Selah.

84:9 @., O God our shield, and look upon the face of @
anointed.

84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a @:. I had rather
be a doorkeeper in the @ of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness.

84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace

up@cly.

84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.



85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast @
back the captivity of @].

85:2 Thou hast for@= the iniquity of thy @, thou hast covered

85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from
the fierceness of @ anger.

85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause @ anger toward us
to cease.

85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out @
anger to all generations?

85:6 Wilt thou not revive us @*: that thy @ may rejoice in

85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will @K: for he will @K @U

85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that @Y may

85:10 Mercy and truth are met @?; @ceousness and @U have

86:1 Bow down @ ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy @<

86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy @<: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift

86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in

86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the @; of my

86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt

86:8 Among the gods @ is none like unto thee, O Lord; @" are

86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my

86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my @: and I will

86:13 For @ is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my

86:14 O God, the proud are risen @

86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,

86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto

87:1 His @Vation is in the holy mountains.

87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of

87:3 Glorious @ are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:

87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments @ be @:

88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night @

88:2 Let my prayer come @	 thee: incline @ ear unto my cry;

88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto

88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man
that hath no strength:

88:5 Free @ the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.

88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
thy waves. Selah.

88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come @.

88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have @,
daily upon thee, I have stretched out my @D unto thee.

88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? @ the dead arise and
praise thee? Selah.

88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
faithfulness in destruction?

88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy @ceousness in
the land of forgetfulness?

88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning @ my
prayer prevent thee.

88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
from me?

88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer
thy terrors I am distracted.

88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

88:17 They came round @+ me daily like @Z; they compassed me
@+ @?.

88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
acquaintance into darkness.



89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my @P

89:2 For I have said, Mercy @ be built up for ever: thy
faithfulness @ thou establish in the very @1s.

89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto @ my

89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to

89:5 And the @1s @ praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy

89:6 For who in the @1 can be compared unto the LORD? who @
the sons of the @By can be likened unto the LORD?

89:7 God is @ly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
be had in reverence of all them that are @+ him.

89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to

89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves @of arise,
thou stillest them.

89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
hast scattered @ enemies with thy strong arm.

89:11 The @1s are @, the @ also is @: as for the world

89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
@ rejoice in thy name.

89:13 Thou hast a @By arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy

89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and

89:15 Blessed is the @ that know the joyful sound: they @

89:16 In thy name @ they rejoice all the day: and in thy

89:17 For thou art the @Y of @ strength: and in thy favour our

89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of @ is our

89:19 Then thou @0st in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
laid help upon one that is @By; I have exalted one chosen out of

89:20 I have @V @ my @<; with my holy oil have I anointed

89:21 With whom my hand @ be established: mine arm also @

89:22 The enemy @ not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
afflict him.

89:23 And I will beat down his foes @	 his face, and plague them
that hate him.

89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy @ be with him: and in my
name @ his horn be exalted.

89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his @c hand in the
rivers.

89:26 He @ cry unto me, Thou art my @, my God, and the rock
of my salvation.

89:27 Also I will make him my @Oborn, higher than the kings of the

89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant @
stand fast with him.

89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
the days of @1.

89:30 If his @ forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

89:32 Then will I visit @ transgression with the rod, and @
iniquity with stripes.

89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the @7 that is gone
out of my lips.

89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto @.

89:36 His seed @ endure for ever, and his throne as the sun @

89:37 It @ be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
witness in @1. Selah.

89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
@ anointed.

89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy @<: thou hast
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast @ his
strong holds to ruin.

89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
neighbours.

89:42 Thou hast set up the @c hand of his adversaries; thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice.

89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his @Q, and hast not made
him to stand in the battle.

89:44 Thou hast made his @Y to cease, and cast his throne down to
the ground.

89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
with shame. Selah.

89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? @ thy wrath
burn like fire?

89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men

89:48 What man is he that liveth, and @ not see @^? @ he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, @ thou swarest

89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy @<s; how I do bear in
my bosom the reproach of all the @By @;

89:51 Wherewith @ enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
have reproached the footsteps of @ anointed.

89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.



90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling @' in all generations.

90:2 Before the mountains were @ @, or ever thou hadst

thou art God.

90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye @

90:4 For a @: @8 in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is

90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in
the morning they are like grass @ groweth up.

90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it

90:7 For we are consumed by @ anger, and by thy wrath are we
troubled.

90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities @	 thee, our secret sins in the

90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our @8
as a tale that is told.

99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the

101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou

101:4 A froward @ @ depart from me: I will not know a wicked

101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him

101:6 Mine eyes @ be upon the faithful of the land, that they may

101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut

102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
incline @ ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.

102:4 My @ is smitten, and wi@d like grass; so that I forget

102:5 By reason of the @; of my groaning my bones cleave to my

102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the

102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the @ top.

102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad

102:9 For I have eaten ashes like @d, and mingled my @b with

102:10 Because of @ indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast

102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am wi@d

102:13 Thou @ arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to

102:16 When the LORD @ build up Zion, he @ appear in his

102:22 When the @ are ga@d @?, and the kingdoms, to

102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:3 Who forgiveth all @ iniquities; who healeth all thy

103:5 Who satisfieth thy @P with good @; so that thy youth is
renewed like the eagle's.

103:6 The LORD executeth @ceousness and judgment for all that are

103:7 He made known his ways unto @, his acts unto the @ of

103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous

103:9 He will not always chide: @" will he keep his anger for

103:10 He hath not dealt with us @ our sins; nor rewarded us

103:11 For as the @1 is high above the @, so @ is his
mercy toward them that fear him.

103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us.

103:13 Like as a @ pitieth his @, so the LORD pitieth them

103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so
he flourisheth.

103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the @'
@of @ know it no more.

103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him, and his @ceousness unto @'s

103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the @1s; and his

103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do

103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that

103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all @'s of his dominion:
bless the LORD, O my soul.



104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very @;
thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
stretchest out the @1s like a curtain:

104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the @Zs: who maketh
the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:5 Who laid the @Vations of the @, that it @# not be

104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the @Zs
stood above the mountains.

104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the @; of thy th@[ they hasted

104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto

104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they

104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, @ run @ the

104:11 They give @b to @ beast of the field: the wild asses
quench @ thirst.

104:12 By them @ the fowls of the @1 have @ habitation,
@ sing @ the branches.

104:13 He @Zeth the hills from his chambers: the @ is satisfied

104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the

104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,

104:17 Where the birds make @ nests: as for the stork, the fir
trees are her @.

104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
for the conies.

104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
down.

104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep @.

104:21 The young lions roar @ @ prey, and seek @ meat from
God.

104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather @T @?, and lay them

104:23 Man goeth @ unto his work and to his labour until the
evening.

104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made

104:25 So is this @ and wide sea, wherein are @ creeping

104:26 There go the ships: @ is that leviathan, whom thou hast

104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them @ meat
in due season.

104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest @ hand,

104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away @

104:30 Thou sendest @ thy spirit, they are created: and thou

104:31 The @Y of the LORD @ endure for ever: the LORD @

104:32 He looketh on the @, and it trembleth: he toucheth the

104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise

104:34 My meditation of him @ be sweet: I will be glad in the

104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the @, and let the

105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the @.

105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word @ he

105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:10 And confirmed the same unto @] for a law, and to @ for

105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of

105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and

105:13 When they went from one nation to @F, from one kingdom to
@F @;

105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
@ sakes;

105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

105:16 Moreover he @, for a famine upon the land: he brake the
whole staff of @d.

105:17 He sent a man @	 them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
@<:

105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
him.

105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the @, and
let him go free.

105:21 He made him lord of his @, and ruler of all his substance:

105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
wisdom.

105:23 @ also came into @-; and @] sojourned in the land of
Ham.

105:24 And he increased his @ @ly; and made them stronger
than @ enemies.

105:25 He turned @ @ to hate his @, to deal subtilly with
his @<s.

105:26 He sent @ his @<; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

105:27 They shewed his signs @ them, and wonders in the land of
Ham.

105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
@
 his word.

105:29 He turned @ @Zs into @I, and slew @ fish.

105:30 Their land @ @ frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
@ kings.

105:31 He @0, and @ came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
@ coasts.

105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in @ land.

105:33 He smote @ vines also and @ fig trees; and brake the
trees of @ coasts.

105:34 He @0, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
@S number,

105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in @ land, and devoured the
fruit of @ ground.

105:36 He smote also all the @Oborn in @ land, the chief of all
@ strength.

105:37 He @ them @ also with silver and gold: and @ was
not one feeble person @ @ tribes.

105:38 @- was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
upon them.

105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
night.

105:40 The @ asked, and he @ quails, and satisfied them
with the @d of @1.

105:41 He opened the rock, and the @Zs gushed out; they ran in the
dry @'s like a river.

105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his @<.

105:43 And he @ @ his @ with joy, and his chosen with
gladness:

105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
labour of the @;

105:45 That they @B observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
ye the LORD.



106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
for his mercy endureth for ever.

106:2 Who can utter the @By acts of the LORD? who can shew @
all his praise?

106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
@ceousness at all times.

106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
@: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation, that I may @Y with @ inheritance.

106:6 We have sinned with our @s, we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly.

106:7 Our @s @[stood not thy wonders in @-; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at
the Red sea.

106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he @B
make his @By power to be known.

106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
@E the depths, as @E the wilderness.

106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

106:11 And the @Zs covered @ enemies: @ was not one of them
left.

106:12 Then believed they his @5; they sang his praise.

106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert.

106:15 And he gave them @ request; but sent leanness into @
soul.

106:16 They envied @ also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
LORD.

106:17 The @ opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
company of Abiram.

106:18 And a fire was kindled in @ company; the flame burned up
the wicked.

106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

106:20 Thus they changed @ @Y into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass.

106:21 They forgat God @ saviour, @ had done @ @ in
@-;

106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible @ by the
Red sea.

106:23 @N he said that he @L destroy them, had not @ his
chosen stood @	 him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
@# destroy them.

106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word:

106:25 But murmured in @ tents, and hearkened not unto the @;
of the LORD.

106:26 @N he lifted up his hand @
 them, to overthrow them
in the wilderness:

106:27 To overthrow @ seed also @ the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands.

106:28 They joined @T also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead.

106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with @ inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them.

106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
plague was stayed.

106:31 And that was counted unto him for @ceousness unto all
generations for evermore.

106:32 They angered him also at the @Zs of strife, so that it went
ill with @ for @ sakes:

106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he @0 unadvisedly
with his lips.

106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
@M them:

106:35 But were mingled @ the heathen, and learned @ works.

106:36 And they served @ idols: @ were a snare unto them.

106:37 Yea, they sacrificed @ sons and @ daughters unto
devils,

106:38 And shed innocent @I, even the @I of @ sons and of
@ daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and
the land was polluted with @I.

106:39 Thus were they defiled with @ own works, and went a whoring
with @ own inventions.

106:40 @N was the wrath of the LORD kindled @
 his @,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them.

106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were @ into
subjection @[ @ hand.

106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
@ counsel, and were @ low for @ iniquity.

106:44 Nevertheless he regarded @ affliction, when he @) @
cry:

106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented @$
to the multitude of his mercies.

106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all @J that carried them
captives.

106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from @ the heathen,
to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of @ from everlasting to
everlasting: and let all the @ say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.



107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever.

107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;

107:3 And ga@d them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
west, from the north, and from the south.

107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they @V no
city to dwell in.

107:5 Hungry and thirsty, @ soul fainted in them.

107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in @ trouble, and he delivered
them out of @ distresses.

107:7 And he led them @ by the @c way, that they @B go to a
city of habitation.

107:8 Oh that men @L praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the @ of men!

107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness.

107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of @^, being bound
in affliction and iron;

107:11 Because they rebelled @
 the @5 of God, and contemned
the counsel of the most High:

107:12 @N he @ down @ @ with labour; they fell
down, and @ was none to help.

107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in @ trouble, and he saved
them out of @ distresses.

107:14 He @ them out of darkness and the shadow of @^, and
brake @ bands in s@[.

107:15 Oh that men @L praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the @ of men!

107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in s@[.

107:17 Fools @ of @ transgression, and @ of @
iniquities, are afflicted.

107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
unto the gates of @^.

107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in @ trouble, and he saveth
them out of @ distresses.

107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
@ destructions.

107:21 Oh that men @L praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the @ of men!

107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
declare his works with rejoicing.

107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
@ @Zs;

107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, @ lifteth
up the waves @of.

107:26 They mount up to the @1, they go down @* to the depths:
@ soul is melted @ of trouble.

107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
at @ wit's end.

107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in @ trouble, and he @(eth
them out of @ distresses.

107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves @of are
still.

107:30 Then are they glad @ they be quiet; so he @(eth them
unto @ desired haven.

107:31 Oh that men @L praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the @ of men!

107:32 Let them exalt him also in the @` of the @, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders.

107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the @Zsprings into
dry ground;

107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
that dwell @in.

107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing @Z, and dry ground
into @Zsprings.

107:36 And @ he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
a city for habitation;

107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, @ may yield fruits
of increase.

107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied @ly; and
suffereth not @ cattle to decrease.

107:39 Again, they are minished and @ low @E oppression,
affliction, and sorrow.

107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness, where @ is no way.

107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
families like a flock.

107:42 The @ceous @ see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity @
stop her @P.

107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe @ @, even they @
@[stand the lovingkindness of the LORD.



108:1 O god, my @ is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
my @Y.

108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, @ the @: and I will sing
praises unto thee @ the nations.

108:4 For thy mercy is @ above the @1s: and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.

108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the @1s: and thy @Y above
all the @;

108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy @c hand, and
answer me.

108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
of mine head; @ is my lawgiver;

108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
Philistia will I triumph.

108:10 Who will @( me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?

108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
O God, go @ with our hosts?

108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

108:13 Through God we @ do valiantly: for he it is that @
tread down our enemies.



109:1 Hold not thy @U, O God of my praise;

109:2 For the @P of the wicked and the @P of the deceitful are
opened @
 me: they have spoken @
 me with a lying tongue.

109:3 They compassed me @+ also with @5 of hatred; and fought
@
 me @S a cause.

109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
prayer.

109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his @c
hand.

109:7 When he @ be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
prayer become sin.

109:8 Let his days be few; and let @F take his office.

109:9 Let his @ be @less, and his wife a widow.

109:10 Let his @ be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
seek @ @d also out of @ desolate @'s.

109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
strangers spoil his labour.

109:12 Let @ be none to extend mercy unto him: @" let @
be any to favour his @less @.

109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
let @ name be blotted out.

109:14 Let the iniquity of his @s be remembered with the LORD;
and let not the sin of his m@C be blotted out.

109:15 Let them be @	 the LORD continually, that he may cut off
the memory of them from the @.

109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
the poor and needy man, that he @B even slay the broken in @.

109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

109:18 As he clothed @9 with cursing like as with his garment, so
let it come into his bowels like @Z, and like oil into his bones.

109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment @ covereth him, and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
of them that @K evil @

109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
@ thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my @ is wounded within me.

109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
down as the locust.

109:24 My knees are weak @E fasting; and my @R faileth of
fatness.

109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
they shaked @ heads.

109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me @$ to thy mercy:

109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
done it.

109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy @< rejoice.

109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
@T with @ own confusion, as with a mantle.

109:30 I will @ly praise the LORD with my @P; yea, I will

109:31 For he @ stand at the @c hand of the poor, to save him

110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my @c hand, until I

110:2 The LORD @ send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule

110:3 Thy @ @ be willing in the day of thy power, in the

110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a @6 for

110:5 The Lord at thy @c hand @ strike @E kings in the day

110:6 He @ judge @ the heathen, he @ fill the @'s with

111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole @,

111:2 The works of the LORD are @, sought out of all them that

111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his @ceousness

111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
gracious and full of compassion.

111:5 He hath @= meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
mindful of his covenant.

111:6 He hath shewed his @ the power of his works, that he may

111:7 The works of his @D are verity and judgment; all his

111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
up@cness.

111:9 He sent redemption unto his @: he hath @M his

111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
@[standing have all they that do his commandments: his praise

112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,

112:2 His seed @ be @By upon @: the generation of the

112:7 He @ not be afraid of evil tidings: his @ is fixed,

112:8 His @ is established, he @ not be afraid, until he see

112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath @= to the poor; his @ceousness

112:10 The wicked @ see it, and be grieved; he @ gnash with

113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye @<s of the LORD, praise

113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time @ and for

113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the

113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy

114:1 When @ went out of @-, the @ of @] from a @

114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like

114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back?

114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,

114:7 Tremble, thou @, at the presence of the Lord, at the

115:2 Wherefore @# the heathen say, Where is now @ God?

115:3 But our God is in the @1s: he hath done whatsoever he hath

115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's @D.

115:5 They have @Ps, but they @K not: eyes have they, but they

115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they

115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is @ one that

115:9 O @, trust thou in the LORD: he is @ help and @

119:84 How many are the days of thy @<? when wilt thou execute

125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto @J that be good, and to them that are

126:1 When the LORD turned @* the captivity of Zion, we were like

126:2 Then was our @P filled with laughter, and our tongue with

126:3 The LORD hath done @ @ for us; whereof we are glad.

126:4 Turn @* our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

127:1 Except the LORD build the @, they labour in vain that build

127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the

127:3 Lo, @ are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the

127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a @By man; so are @ of

129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long @ furrows.

129:4 The LORD is @ceous: he hath cut as@[ the cords of the

130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I

130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the

132:12 If thy @ will keep my covenant and my testimony that I

132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired

132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor

133:1 @., how good and how pleasant it is for @3 to dwell

133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down

135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in @1, and in

135:14 For the LORD will judge his @, and he will repent @9

135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's

135:16 They have @Ps, but they @K not; eyes have they, but they

136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for

137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, @ we sat down, yea, we wept, when

137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the @a @of.

137:3 For @ they that carried us away captive required of us a

137:5 If I forget thee, O @ , let my @c hand forget her

137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of

137:7 Remember, O LORD, the @ of Edom in the day of @ ;

137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy @ he

138:1 I will praise thee with my whole @: @	 the gods will I

138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word

138:3 In the day when I cried thou @>st me, and strengthenedst

138:4 All the kings of the @ @ praise thee, O LORD, when they

138:5 Yea, they @ sing in the ways of the LORD: for @ is the

138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but
the proud he knoweth afar off.

138:7 Though I walk in the @a of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou
@ stretch @ @ hand @

138:8 The LORD will perfect that @ concerneth me: thy mercy, O

139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
@[standest my thought afar off.

139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted

139:4 For @ is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou

139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and @	, and laid @ hand upon

139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot

139:7 Whither @ I go from thy spirit? or whither @ I flee from

139:8 If I ascend up into @1, thou art @: if I make my bed in

139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness @ cover me; even the night

139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
m@C's womb.

139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth @c well.

139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the @.

139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
thy book all my members were written, @ in continuance were
fashioned, when as yet @ was none of them.

139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how @ is
the sum of them!

139:18 If I @# count them, they are more in number than the sand:
when I awake, I am still with thee.

139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
@fore, ye @Iy men.

139:20 For they @K @

thy name in vain.

139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
grieved with @J that rise up @

139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

139:23 Search me, O God, and know my @: try me, and know my

139:24 And see if @ be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the

140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the

140:3 They have sharpened @ tongues like a serpent; adders' poison

140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the @D of the wicked; preserve me from
the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a
net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the @; of my

140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle.

140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
wicked device; lest they exalt @T. Selah.

140:9 As for the head of @J that compass me @+, let the mischief

140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the

140:11 Let not an evil @Ker be established in the @: evil @

140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,

140:13 Surely the @ceous @ give thanks unto thy name: the

141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my

141:2 Let my prayer be set @ @	 thee as incense; and the

141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, @	 my @P; keep the door of my lips.

141:4 Incline not my @ to any evil @7, to practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of @ dainties.

141:5 Let the @ceous smite me; it @ be a kindness: and let him

141:6 When @ judges are overthrown in stony @'s, they @

141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's @P, as when one

141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my

141:9 Keep me from the snares @ they have laid for me, and the
gins of the workers of iniquity.

141:10 Let the wicked fall into @ own nets, whilst that I withal
escape.



142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my @;; with my @; unto the LORD

142:2 I poured out my complaint @	 him; I shewed @	 him my

142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my

In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

142:4 I looked on my @c hand, and beheld, but @ was no man that
@L know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my

142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am @ very low: deliver me from
my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the

143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy @ceousness.

143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy @<: for in thy sight
@ no man living be justified.

143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as @J
that have been long dead.

143:4 @N is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my @ within me
is desolate.

143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse
on the work of thy @D.

143:6 I stretch @ my @D unto thee: my soul thirsteth @

143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face

143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee

143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide

143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is

143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy @ceousness'

143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them

144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength @ teacheth my @D to war,

144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son

144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth

144:5 Bow thy @1s, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and

144:6 Cast @ lightning, and scatter them: shoot out @ arrows,

144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an

144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth @
his @< from the hurtful @Q.

144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange @, whose

144:15 Happy is that @, that is in such a case: yea, happy is

145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for

145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever

145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion

145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all @J that

145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them @ meat

145:16 Thou openest @ hand, and satisfiest the desire of @
living @7.

145:17 The LORD is @ceous in all his ways, and holy in all his
works.

145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth.

145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
hear @ cry, and will save them.

145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
will he destroy.

145:21 My @P @ @K the praise of the LORD: and let all @R
bless his holy name for ever and ever.



146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my
God while I have any being.

146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
@ is no help.

146:4 His breath goeth @, he returneth to his @; in that very
day his thoughts perish.

146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of @] for his help, whose hope
is in the LORD his God:

146:6 Which made @1, and @, the sea, and all that @in is:
@ keepeth truth for ever:

146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: @ giveth food to
the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the @ceous:

146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the @less
and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

146:10 The LORD @ reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
generations. Praise ye the LORD.



147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God;
for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

147:2 The LORD doth build up @ : he ga@th @? the
outcasts of @.

147:3 He healeth the broken in @, and bindeth up @ wounds.

147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by @
names.

147:5 Great is our Lord, and of @ power: his @[standing is
infinite.

147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the
ground.

147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp
unto our God:

147:8 Who covereth the @1 with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
@, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens @
cry.

147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man.

147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in @J that
hope in his mercy.

147:12 Praise the LORD, O @ ; praise thy God, O Zion.

147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
thy @ within thee.

147:14 He maketh @U in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
finest of the wheat.

147:15 He sendeth @ his commandment upon @: his word runneth
very swiftly.

147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes.

147:17 He casteth @ his ice like morsels: who can stand @	 his
cold?

147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
to blow, and the @Zs flow.

147:19 He sheweth his word unto @], his statutes and his judgments
unto @.

147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments,
they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.



148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the @1s: praise
him in the heights.

148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.

148:4 Praise him, ye @1s of @1s, and ye @Zs that be above
the @1s.

148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he @M, and they
were created.

148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
decree @ @ not pass.

148:7 Praise the LORD from the @, ye dragons, and all deeps:

148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
word:

148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping @, and flying fowl:

148:11 Kings of the @, and all @; princes, and all judges of
the @:

148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and @:

148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
excellent; his @Y is above the @ and @1.

148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his @, the praise of all his
saints; even of the @ of @, a @ near unto him. Praise
ye the LORD.



149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
praise in the @` of saints.

149:2 Let @ rejoice in him that made him: let the @ of
Zion be joyful in @ King.

149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
unto him with the timbrel and harp.

149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his @: he will beautify the
meek with salvation.

149:5 Let the saints be joyful in @Y: let them sing aloud upon
@ beds.

149:6 Let the high praises of God be in @ @P, and a two-edged
@Q in @ hand;

149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
@;

149:8 To bind @ kings with chains, and @ nobles with fetters
of iron;

149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all
his saints. Praise ye the LORD.



150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
the firmament of his power.

150:2 Praise him for his @By acts: praise him @$ to his
excellent @ness.

150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
psaltery and harp.

150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed
instruments and organs.

150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
sounding cymbals.

150:6 Let @ @7 that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.




The Proverbs


1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of @, king of @; 1:2 To
know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the @5 of @[standing;
1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and
equity; 1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge
and discretion.

1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
@[standing @ attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To @[stand a
proverb, and the interpretation; the @5 of the wise, and @ dark
@s.

1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
despise wisdom and instruction.

1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy @, and forsake not the
law of thy m@C: 1:9 For they @ be an ornament of grace unto thy
head, and chains @+ thy neck.

1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for @I, let us lurk
privily for the innocent @S cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up
alive as the grave; and whole, as @J that go down into the pit:
1:13 We @ find all precious substance, we @ fill our @s
with spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot @ us; let us all have one purse:
1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from
@ path: 1:16 For @ feet run to evil, and make haste to shed
@I.

1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

1:18 And they lay wait for @ own @I; they lurk privily for
@ own lives.

1:19 So are the ways of @ one that is greedy of gain; @ taketh
away the life of the owners @of.

1:20 Wisdom crieth @S; she uttereth her @; in the streets:
1:21 She crieth in the chief @' of concourse, in the openings of
the gates: in the city she uttereth her @5, @, 1:22 How long,
ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in
@ scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  1:23 Turn you at my
reproof: @%, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known
my @5 unto you.

1:24 Because I have @,, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my
counsel, and @L none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your
calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear
cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you.

1:28 Then @ they call upon me, but I will not answer; they @
seek me early, but they @ not find me: 1:29 For that they hated
knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They @L
none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

1:31 @N @ they eat of the fruit of @ own way, and be
filled with @ own devices.

1:32 For the turning away of the simple @ slay them, and the
prosperity of fools @ destroy them.

1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me @ dwell safely, and @ be
quiet from fear of evil.

2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my @5, and hide my commandments
with thee; 2:2 So that thou incline @ ear unto wisdom, and apply
@ @ to @[standing; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest @ knowledge,
and liftest up thy @; for @[standing; 2:4 If thou seekest her as
silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then @
thou @[stand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.

2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his @P cometh knowledge and
@[standing.

2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the @ceous: he is a buckler to
them that walk up@cly.

2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
saints.

2:9 Then @ thou @[stand @ceousness, and judgment, and
equity; yea, @ good path.

2:10 When wisdom entereth into @ @, and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion @ preserve thee, @[standing
@ keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
from the man that @Keth froward @; 2:13 Who leave the paths of
up@cness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do
evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15 Whose ways
are crooked, and they froward in @ paths: 2:16 To deliver thee
from the strange woman, even from the stranger @ flattereth with
her @5; 2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth
the covenant of her God.

2:18 For her @ inclineth unto @^, and her paths unto the dead.

2:19 None that go unto her return @*, @" take they hold of the
paths of life.

2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
of the @ceous.

2:21 For the up@c @ dwell in the land, and the perfect @
remain in it.

2:22 But the wicked @ be cut off from the @, and the
transgressors @ be rooted out of it.

3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let @ @ keep my
commandments: 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and @U, @
they add to thee.

3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them @+ thy neck;
write them upon the table of @ @: 3:4 So @ thou find
favour and good @[standing in the sight of God and man.

3:5 Trust in the LORD with all @ @; and lean not unto @
own @[standing.

3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he @ direct thy paths.

3:7 Be not wise in @ own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
evil.

3:8 It @ be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the @Ofruits of
all @ increase: 3:10 So @ thy barns be filled with plenty, and
thy presses @ burst out with new wine.

3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; @" be weary
of his correction: 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even
as a @ the son in whom he delighteth.

3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
@[standing.

3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
silver, and the gain @of than fine gold.

3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the @ thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her.

3:16 Length of days is in her @c hand; and in her left hand riches
and honour.

3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are @U.

3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy
is @ one that retaineth her.

3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath @Ved the @; by @[standing hath
he established the @1s.

3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
down the dew.

3:21 My son, let not them depart from @ eyes: keep sound wisdom
and discretion: 3:22 So @ they be life unto thy soul, and grace to
thy neck.

3:23 Then @ thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot @ not
stumble.

3:24 When thou liest down, thou @ not be afraid: yea, thou @
lie down, and thy sleep @ be sweet.

3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, @" of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh.

3:26 For the LORD @ be thy confidence, and @ keep thy foot
from being taken.

3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of @ hand to do it.

3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come @*, and to morrow I
will give; when thou hast it by thee.

3:29 Devise not evil @
 thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
securely by thee.

3:30 Strive not with a man @S cause, if he have done thee no
harm.

3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
with the @ceous.

3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the @ of the wicked: but he
blesseth the habitation of the just.

3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
lowly.

3:35 The wise @ inherit @Y: but shame @ be the promotion of
fools.

4:1 Hear, ye @, the instruction of a @, and attend to know
@[standing.

4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

4:3 For I was my @'s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of
my m@C.

4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let @ @ retain my
@5: keep my commandments, and live.

4:5 Get wisdom, get @[standing: forget it not; @" decline from
the @5 of my @P.

4:6 Forsake her not, and she @ preserve thee: love her, and she
@ keep thee.

4:7 Wisdom is the principal @7; @fore get wisdom: and with all
thy getting get @[standing.

4:8 Exalt her, and she @ promote thee: she @ @( thee to
honour, when thou dost embrace her.

4:9 She @ give to @ head an ornament of grace: a crown of
@Y @ she deliver to thee.

4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my @s; and the @8 of thy life
@ be many.

4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in @c
paths.

4:12 When thou goest, thy steps @ not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou @ not stumble.

4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she
is thy life.

4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of
evil men.

4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and @
sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

4:17 For they eat the @d of wickedness, and @b the wine of
violence.

4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day.

4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they
stumble.

4:20 My son, attend to my @5; incline @ ear unto my @s.

4:21 Let them not depart from @ eyes; keep them in the @a of
@ @.

4:22 For they are life unto @J that find them, and health to all
@ @R.

4:23 Keep thy @ with all diligence; for out of it are the issues
of life.

4:24 Put away from thee a froward @P, and perverse lips put far
from thee.

4:25 Let @ eyes look @c on, and let @ eyelids look straight
@	 thee.

4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

4:27 Turn not to the @c hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from
evil.

5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow @ ear to my
@[standing: 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy
lips may keep knowledge.

5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
@P is smo@C than oil: 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged @Q.

5:5 Her feet go down to @^; her steps take hold on hell.

5:6 Lest thou @#est ponder the path of life, her ways are
moveable, that thou canst not know them.

5:7 Hear me now @fore, O ye @, and depart not from the
@5 of my @P.

5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
@: 5:9 Lest thou give @ honour unto @Cs, and thy @8 unto
the cruel: 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy
labours be in the @ of a stranger; 5:11 And thou mourn at the
last, when thy @R and thy body are consumed, 5:12 And say, How have
I hated instruction, and my @ despised reproof; 5:13 And have not
obeyed the @; of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that
instructed me!  5:14 I was almost in all evil in the @a of the
@` and assembly.

5:15 Drink @Zs out of @ own cistern, and running @Zs out of
@ own well.

5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of @Zs in
the streets.

5:17 Let them be only @ own, and not strangers' with thee.

5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth.

5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts
satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and
embrace the bosom of a stranger?  5:21 For the ways of man are @	
the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.

5:22 His own iniquities @ take the wicked @9, and he @ be
holden with the cords of his sins.

5:23 He @ die @S instruction; and in the @ness of his
folly he @ go astray.

6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken
thy hand with a stranger, 6:2 Thou art snared with the @5 of thy
@P, thou art taken with the @5 of thy @P.

6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into
the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

6:4 Give not sleep to @ eyes, nor slumber to @ eyelids.

6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler.

6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 6:7
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 Provideth her meat in
the summer, and ga@th her food in the harvest.

6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep?  6:10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the @D to sleep: 6:11 So @ thy poverty come as one
that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward @P.

6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he @Keth with his feet, he teacheth
with his fingers; 6:14 Frowardness is in his @, he deviseth
mischief continually; he soweth discord.

6:15 @N @ his calamity come suddenly; suddenly @ he be
broken @S remedy.

6:16 These six @ doth the LORD hate: yea, @H are an
abomination unto him: 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and @D
that shed innocent @I, 6:18 An @ that deviseth wicked
imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 6:19 A false
witness that @Keth lies, and he that soweth discord @ @3.

6:20 My son, keep thy @'s commandment, and forsake not the law of
thy m@C: 6:21 Bind them continually upon @ @, and tie them
@+ thy neck.

6:22 When thou goest, it @ lead thee; when thou sleepest, it @
keep thee; and when thou awakest, it @ talk with thee.

6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs
of instruction are the way of life: 6:24 To keep thee from the evil
woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

6:25 Lust not @ her beauty in @ @; @" let her take
thee with her eyelids.

6:26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is @ to a piece of
@d: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  6:29 So
he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her @
not be innocent.

6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when
he is hungry; 6:31 But if he be @V, he @ restore @Hfold; he
@ give all the substance of his @.

6:32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh @[standing:
he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

6:33 A wound and dishonour @ he get; and his reproach @ not be
wiped away.

6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: @fore he will not spare in
the day of vengeance.

6:35 He will not regard any ransom; @" will he rest content,
though thou givest many gifts.

7:1 My son, keep my @5, and lay up my commandments with thee.

7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of @
eye.

7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of @
@.

7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call @[standing thy
kinswoman: 7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from
the stranger @ flattereth with her @5.

7:6 For at the window of my @ I looked @E my casement, 7:7
And beheld @ the simple ones, I discerned @ the youths, a
young man void of @[standing, 7:8 Passing @E the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her @, 7:9 In the twilight, in
the evening, in the black and dark night: 7:10 And, @%, @ met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of @.

7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her @: 7:12
Now is she @S, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at @
corner.)  7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent
face said unto him, 7:14 I have @U @&s with me; this day have
I payed my vows.

7:15 @N came I @ to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face,
and I have @V thee.

7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of @-.

7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
solace ourselves with loves.

7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 7:20
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
appointed.

7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
flattering of her lips she forced him.

7:22 He goeth @ her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 7:23 Till a dart strike
@E his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not

7:24 Hearken unto me now @fore, O ye @, and attend to the
@5 of my @P.

7:25 Let not @ @ decline to her ways, go not astray in her
paths.

7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
been slain by her.

7:27 Her @ is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
@^.

8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and @[standing put @ her @;?  8:2
She standeth in the top of high @'s, by the way in the @'s of
the paths.

8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming
in at the doors.

8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my @; is to the sons of man.

8:5 O ye simple, @[stand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an

8:6 Hear; for I will @K of excellent @; and the opening of my

8:7 For my @P @ @K truth; and wickedness is an abomination

8:8 All the @5 of my @P are in @ceousness; @ is no@7
froward or perverse in them.

8:9 They are all plain to him that @[standeth, and @c to them
that find knowledge.

8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than
choice gold.

8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the @ that may be
desired are not to be compared to it.

8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
inventions.

8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and
the evil way, and the froward @P, do I hate.

8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am @[standing; I have
strength.

8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the @.

8:17 I love them that love me; and @J that seek me early @ find

8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
@ceousness.

8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue

8:20 I lead in the way of @ceousness, in the @a of the paths of
judgment: 8:21 That I may cause @J that love me to inherit
substance; and I will fill @ treasures.

8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, @	 his
works of old.

8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
@ was.

8:24 When @ were no depths, I was @ @; when @ were
no fountains abounding with @Z.

8:25 Before the mountains were settled, @	 the hills was I @
@: 8:26 While as yet he had not made the @, nor the fields,
nor the highest part of the dust of the world.

8:27 When he prepared the @1s, I was @: when he set a compass
upon the face of the depth: 8:28 When he established the clouds above:
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 8:29 When he gave to
the sea his decree, that the @Zs @# not pass his commandment:
when he appointed the @Vations of the @: 8:30 Then I was by
him, as one @ up with him: and I was daily his delight,
rejoicing always @	 him; 8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of
his @; and my delights were with the sons of men.

8:32 Now @fore hearken unto me, O ye @: for blessed are
they that keep my ways.

8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,
waiting at the posts of my doors.

8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and @ obtain favour of the
LORD.

8:36 But he that sinneth @
 me wrongeth his own soul: all they
that hate me love @^.

9:1 Wisdom hath builded her @, she hath hewn out her @H
pillars: 9:2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
she hath also furnished her table.

9:3 She hath sent @ her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
@'s of the city, 9:4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as
for him that wanteth @[standing, she @
 to him, 9:5 Come, eat of
my @d, and @b of the wine @ I have mingled.

9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of @[standing.

9:7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to @9 shame: and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth @9 a blot.

9:8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and
he will love thee.

9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a
just man, and he will increase in learning.

9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
knowledge of the holy is @[standing.

9:11 For by me thy days @ be multiplied, and the @8 of thy life
@ be increased.

9:12 If thou be wise, thou @ be wise for thyself: but if thou
scornest, thou alone @ bear it.

9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth no@7.

9:14 For she sitteth at the door of her @, on a seat in the high
@'s of the city, 9:15 To call passengers who go @c on @
ways: 9:16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him
that wanteth @[standing, she @
 to him, 9:17 Stolen @Zs are
sweet, and @d eaten in secret is pleasant.

9:18 But he knoweth not that the dead are @; and that her guests
are in the depths of hell.

10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad @: but a
foolish son is the heaviness of his m@C.

10:2 Treasures of wickedness profit no@7: but @ceousness

10:3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the @ceous to famish: but

10:4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of

10:5 He that ga@th in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth

10:11 The @P of a @ceous man is a well of life: but violence

10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

10:13 In the lips of him that hath @[standing wisdom is @V: but
a rod is for the back of him that is void of @[standing.

10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the @P of the foolish is near
destruction.

10:15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the
poor is @ poverty.

10:16 The labour of the @ceous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
wicked to sin.

10:17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
refuseth reproof erreth.

10:18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
slander, is a fool.

10:19 In the multitude of @5 @ wanteth not sin: but he that
refraineth his lips is wise.

10:20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the @ of the
wicked is little worth.

10:21 The lips of the @ceous feed many: but fools die for want of
wisdom.

10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
sorrow with it.

10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
@[standing hath wisdom.

10:24 The fear of the wicked, it @ come upon him: but the desire

10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the

10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
sluggard to them that send him.

10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the @8 of the
wicked @ be shortened.

10:28 The hope of the @ceous @ be gladness: but the expectation

10:31 The @P of the just @(eth @ wisdom: but the froward

10:32 The lips of the @ceous know what is acceptable: but the @P

11:1 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is
his delight.

11:2 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
wisdom.

11:3 The integrity of the up@c @ guide them: but the

11:4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but @ceousness

11:9 An hypocrite with his @P destroyeth his neighbour: but @E

11:10 When it goeth well with the @ceous, the city rejoiceth: and

11:11 By the blessing of the up@c the city is exalted: but it is
overthrown by the @P of the wicked.

11:12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of
@[standing holdeth his @U.

11:13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful

11:14 Where no counsel is, the @ fall: but in the multitude of
counsellors @ is safety.

11:15 He that is surety for a stranger @ smart for it: and he that
hateth suretiship is sure.

11:16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.

11:17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
cruel troubleth his own @R.

11:18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth

11:19 As @ceousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil

11:22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman @

11:23 The desire of the @ceous is only good: but the expectation of

11:24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and @ is that

14:30 A sound @ is the life of the @R: but envy the rottenness

15:29 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
the @ceous.

15:30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the @: and a good report
maketh the bones fat.

15:31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth @ the wise.

15:32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that
heareth reproof getteth @[standing.

15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and @	
honour is humility.

16:1 The preparations of the @ in man, and the answer of the
tongue, is from the LORD.

16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
weigheth the spirits.

16:3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts @ be
established.

16:4 The LORD hath made all @ for @9: yea, even the wicked
for the day of evil.

16:5 Every one that is proud in @ is an abomination to the LORD:
though hand join in hand, he @ not be unpunished.

16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
LORD men depart from evil.

16:7 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to
be at @U with him.

16:8 Better is a little with @ceousness than @ revenues @S
@c.

16:9 A man's @ deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his @P
transgresseth not in judgment.

16:11 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the
bag are his work.

16:12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
throne is established by @ceousness.

16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that
@Keth @c.

16:14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of @^: but a wise man
will pacify it.

16:15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
is as a cloud of the latter rain.

16:16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
@[standing rather to be chosen than silver!  16:17 The highway of
the up@c is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth
his soul.

16:18 Pride goeth @	 destruction, and an haughty spirit @	 a
fall.

16:19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
divide the spoil with the proud.

16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely @ find good: and whoso
trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

16:21 The wise in @ @ be @, prudent: and the sweetness of
the lips increaseth learning.

16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but
the instruction of fools is folly.

16:23 The @ of the wise teacheth his @P, and addeth learning to
his lips.

16:24 Pleasant @5 are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
health to the bones.

16:25 There is a way that seemeth @c unto a man, but the end
@of are the ways of @^.

16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for @9; for his @P craveth
it of him.

16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips @ is as a
burning fire.

16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
friends.

16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
way that is not good.

16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward @: moving his lips
he @(eth evil to pass.

16:31 The hoary head is a crown of @Y, if it be @V in the way of
@ceousness.

16:32 He that is slow to anger is better than the @By; and he that
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing @of is
of the LORD.

17:1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness @with, than an @
full of sacrifices with strife.

17:2 A wise @< @ have rule over a son that causeth shame, and
@ have part of the inheritance @ the @3.

17:3 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the
LORD trieth the @s.

17:4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to
a naughty tongue.

17:5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad
at calamities @ not be unpunished.

17:6 Children's @ are the crown of old men; and the @Y of
@ are @ @s.

17:7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a
prince.

17:8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

17:9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an @/ stripes
into a fool.

17:11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: @fore a cruel messenger
@ be sent @
 him.

17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
in his folly.

17:13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil @ not depart from his
@.

17:14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out @Z:
@fore leave off contention, @	 it be meddled with.

17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just,
even they both are abomination to the LORD.

17:16 Wherefore is @ a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
seeing he hath no @ to it?  17:17 A friend loveth at all times,
and a @X is born for adversity.

17:18 A man void of @[standing striketh @D, and becometh surety
in the presence of his friend.

17:19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth
his gate seeketh destruction.

17:20 He that hath a froward @ findeth no good: and he that hath a
perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the @
of a fool hath no joy.

17:22 A merry @ doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
drieth the bones.

17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways
of judgment.

17:24 Wisdom is @	 him that hath @[standing; but the eyes of a
fool are in the ends of the @.

17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his @, and bitterness to her
that bare him.

17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
equity.

17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his @5: and a man of
@[standing is of an excellent spirit.

17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his @U, is counted wise: and he
that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of @[standing.

18:1 Through desire a man, having separated @9, seeketh and
intermeddleth with all wisdom.

18:2 A fool hath no delight in @[standing, but that his @ may
discover itself.

18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
ignominy reproach.

18:4 The @5 of a man's @P are as deep @Zs, and the wellspring
of wisdom as a flowing brook.

18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow
the @ceous in judgment.

18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his @P calleth for
strokes.

18:7 A fool's @P is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of
his soul.

18:8 The @5 of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly.

18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is @X to him that is a
@ waster.

18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the @ceous runneth
into it, and is safe.

18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in
his own conceit.

18:12 Before destruction the @ of man is haughty, and @	
honour is humility.

18:13 He that answereth a matter @	 he heareth it, it is folly and
shame unto him.

18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
spirit who can bear?  18:15 The @ of the prudent getteth
knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and @(eth him @	 @
men.

18:17 He that is @O in his own cause seemeth just; but his
neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
@By.

18:19 A @X offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
@ contentions are like the bars of a castle.

18:20 A man's belly @ be satisfied with the fruit of his @P;
and with the increase of his lips @ he be filled.

18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
love it @ eat the fruit @of.

18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good @7, and obtaineth favour
of the LORD.

18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

18:24 A man that hath friends must shew @9 friendly: and @ is
a friend that sticketh closer than a @X.

19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is
perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

19:2 Also, that the soul be @S knowledge, it is not good; and he
that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his @ fretteth
@
 the LORD.

19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
neighbour.

19:5 A false witness @ not be unpunished, and he that @Keth
lies @ not escape.

19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and @ man is a
friend to him that giveth gifts.

19:7 All the @3 of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
friends go far from him? he pursueth them with @5, yet they are
wanting to him.

19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
@[standing @ find good.

19:9 A false witness @ not be unpunished, and he that @Keth
lies @ perish.

19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a @< to
have rule over princes.

19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his @Y
to pass over a transgression.

19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is
as dew upon the grass.

19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his @: and the contentions
of a wife are a continual dropping.

19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of @s: and a prudent
wife is from the LORD.

19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul @
suffer hunger.

19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
that despiseth his ways @ die.

19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that
@ he hath @= will he pay him @*.

19:18 Chasten thy son while @ is hope, and let not thy soul spare
for his crying.

19:19 A man of @ wrath @ suffer punishment: for if thou
deliver him, yet thou must do it @*.

19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise
in thy latter end.

19:21 There are many devices in a man's @; nevertheless the
counsel of the LORD, that @ stand.

19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
than a liar.

19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it @
abide satisfied; he @ not be visited with evil.

19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
much as @( it to his @P @*.

19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
that hath @[standing, and he will @[stand knowledge.

19:26 He that wasteth his @, and chaseth away his m@C, is a
son that causeth shame, and @(eth reproach.

19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from
the @5 of knowledge.

19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the @P of the
wicked devoureth iniquity.

19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of
fools.

20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong @b is raging: and whosoever is
deceived @by is not wise.

20:2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh
him to anger sinneth @
 his own soul.

20:3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but @ fool
will be meddling.

20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; @fore @
he beg in harvest, and have no@7.

20:5 Counsel in the @ of man is like deep @Z; but a man of
@[standing will draw it out.

20:6 Most men will proclaim @ one his own goodness: but a faithful
man who can find?  20:7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his
@ are blessed @ him.

20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all
evil with his eyes.

20:9 Who can say, I have made my @ clean, I am pure from my sin?
20:10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
abomination to the LORD.

20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
and whether it be @c.

20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
both of them.

20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open @ eyes, and
thou @ be satisfied with @d.

20:14 It is naught, it is naught, @
 the buyer: but when he is gone
his way, then he boasteth.

20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
knowledge are a precious jewel.

20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but @wards his @P
@ be filled with gravel.

20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
make war.

20:19 He that goeth @+ as a talebearer revealeth secrets: @fore
meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

20:20 Whoso curseth his @ or his m@C, his lamp @ be put
out in obscure darkness.

20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
end @of @ not be blessed.

20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and
he @ save thee.

20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
balance is not good.

20:24 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then @[stand his
own way?  20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that @ is
holy, and @ vows to make enquiry.

20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and @(eth the wheel over
them.

20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
inward parts of the belly.

20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by
mercy.

20:29 The @Y of young men is @ strength: and the beauty of old
men is the grey head.

20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
inward parts of the belly.

21:1 The king's @ is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
@Z: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

21:2 Every way of a man is @c in his own eyes: but the LORD
pondereth the @s.

21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
sacrifice.

21:4 An high look, and a proud @, and the plowing of the wicked,
is sin.

21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of
@ one that is hasty only to want.

21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to
and fro of them that seek @^.

21:7 The robbery of the wicked @ destroy them; @ they refuse
to do judgment.

21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his
work is @c.

21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the @top, than with a
brawling woman in a wide @.

21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
favour in his eyes.

21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when
the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

21:12 The @ceous man wisely considereth the @ of the wicked:
but God overthroweth the wicked for @ wickedness.

21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also @
cry @9, but @ not be @).

21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
strong wrath.

21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction @ be
to the workers of iniquity.

21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of @[standing @
remain in the @` of the dead.

21:17 He that loveth pleasure @ be a poor man: he that loveth wine
and oil @ not be rich.

21:18 The wicked @ be a ransom for the @ceous, and the
transgressor for the up@c.

21:19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious
and an angry woman.

21:20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

21:21 He that followeth @ @ceousness and mercy findeth life,
@ceousness, and honour.

21:22 A wise man scaleth the city of the @By, and casteth down the
strength of the confidence @of.

21:23 Whoso keepeth his @P and his tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles.

21:24 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
wrath.

21:25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his @D refuse to
labour.

21:26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the @ceous giveth
and spareth not.

21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when
he @(eth it with a wicked mind?  21:28 A false witness @
perish: but the man that heareth @Keth constantly.

21:29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the up@c, he
directeth his way.

21:30 There is no wisdom nor @[standing nor counsel @
 the
LORD.

21:31 The horse is prepared @
 the day of battle: but safety is
of the LORD.

22:1 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than @ riches, and loving
favour rather than silver and gold.

22:2 The rich and poor meet @?: the LORD is the maker of them
all.

22:3 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth @9: but the
simple pass on, and are punished.

22:4 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and
life.

22:5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
keep his soul @ be far from them.

22:6 Train up a child in the way he @# go: and when he is old, he
will not depart from it.

22:7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is @< to the
lender.

22:8 He that soweth iniquity @ reap vanity: and the rod of his
anger @ fail.

22:9 He that hath a bountiful eye @ be blessed; for he giveth of
his @d to the poor.

22:10 Cast out the scorner, and contention @ go out; yea, strife
and reproach @ cease.

22:11 He that loveth pureness of @, for the grace of his lips the
king @ be his friend.

22:12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the
@5 of the transgressor.

22:13 The slothful man @
, There is a lion @S, I @ be
slain in the streets.

22:14 The @P of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of
the LORD @ fall @in.

22:15 Foolishness is bound in the @ of a child; but the rod of
correction @ drive it far from him.

22:16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that
giveth to the rich, @ surely come to want.

22:17 Bow down @ ear, and hear the @5 of the wise, and apply
@ @ unto my knowledge.

22:18 For it is a pleasant @7 if thou keep them within thee; they
@ withal be fitted in thy lips.

22:19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
this day, even to thee.

22:20 Have not I written to thee excellent @ in counsels and
knowledge, 22:21 That I @B make thee know the certainty of the
@5 of truth; that thou @Best answer the @5 of truth to them
that send unto thee?  22:22 Rob not the poor, @ he is poor:
@" oppress the afflicted in the gate: 22:23 For the LORD will
plead @ cause, and spoil the soul of @J that spoiled them.

22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
thou @ not go: 22:25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to
thy soul.

22:26 Be not thou one of them that strike @D, or of them that are
sureties for debts.

22:27 If thou hast no@7 to pay, why @# he take away thy bed
from @[ thee?  22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, @ thy

22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he @ stand @	
kings; he @ not stand @	 mean men.

23:1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what

23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from @ own wisdom.

23:5 Wilt thou set @ eyes upon that @ is not? for riches
certainly make @T wings; they fly away as an eagle toward
@1.

23:6 Eat thou not the @d of him that hath an evil eye, @"
desire thou his dainty meats: 23:7 For as he thinketh in his @, so

 he to thee; but his @ is not with
thee.

23:8 The morsel @ thou hast eaten @ thou vomit up, and lose
thy sweet @5.

23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom
of thy @5.

23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
the @less: 23:11 For @ redeemer is @By; he @ plead
@ cause with thee.

23:12 Apply @ @ unto instruction, and @ ears to the @5

23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him
with the rod, he @ not die.

23:14 Thou @ beat him with the rod, and @ deliver his soul

23:15 My son, if @ @ be wise, my @ @ rejoice, even

23:16 Yea, my reins @ rejoice, when thy lips @K @c @.

23:17 Let not @ @ envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the

23:18 For surely @ is an end; and @ expectation @ not be

23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide @ @ in the

23:20 Be not @ winebibbers; @ riotous eaters of @R: 23:21
For the drunkard and the glutton @ come to poverty: and drowsiness

23:22 Hearken unto thy @ that begat thee, and despise not thy

23:23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,

23:24 The @ of the @ceous @ @ly rejoice: and he that

23:25 Thy @ and thy m@C @ be glad, and she that bare thee

23:26 My son, give me @ @, and let @ eyes observe my ways.

23:27 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
pit.

23:28 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the

26:8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth

26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than @H men that can

26:17 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to

26:18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and @^, 26:19 So

26:20 Where no wood is, @ the fire goeth out: so where @ is no
talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

26:21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
contentious man to kindle strife.

26:22 The @5 of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly.

26:23 Burning lips and a wicked @ are like a potsherd covered with
silver dross.

26:24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit

26:27 Whoso diggeth a pit @ fall @in: and he that rolleth a

26:28 A lying tongue hateth @J that are afflicted by it; and a

27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day
may @( @.

27:2 Let @F man praise thee, and not @ own @P; a stranger,

27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
heavier than them both.

27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand
@	 envy?  27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful.

27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul @
bitter @7 is sweet.

27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that

27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the @: so doth the sweetness of

27:10 Thine own friend, and thy @'s friend, forsake not; @"

27:11 My son, be wise, and make my @ glad, that I may answer him

27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth @9; but the

pledge of him for a strange woman.

27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud @;, rising early in

27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman
are alike.

27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his

27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend.

27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are

27:22 Though thou @#est bray a fool in a mortar @ wheat with a
pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well
to thy herds.

27:24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to @

27:26 The lambs are for thy clo@7, and the goats are the price of

31:19 She layeth her @D to the spindle, and her @D hold the
distaff.

31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth @
her @D to the needy.

31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her @hold: for all her
@hold are clothed with scarlet.

31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clo@7 is silk
and purple.

31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth @ the
elders of the land.

31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
unto the merchant.

31:25 Strength and honour are her clo@7; and she @ rejoice in
time to come.

31:26 She openeth her @P with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law
of kindness.

31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her @hold, and eateth not
the @d of idleness.

31:28 Her @ arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
and he praiseth her.

31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
all.

31:30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
feareth the LORD, she @ be praised.

31:31 Give her of the fruit of her @D; and let her own works praise
her in the gates.




Ecclesiastes

or

The Preacher


1:1 The @5 of the Preacher, the son of @, king in @ .

1:2 Vanity of vanities, @
 the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
vanity.

1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labour @ he taketh @[ the
sun?  1:4 One generation passeth away, and @F generation cometh:
but the @ abideth for ever.

1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his
@' where he arose.

1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth @+ unto the north;
it whirleth @+ continually, and the wind returneth @* @$
to his circuits.

1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the
@' from whence the rivers come, thither they return @*.

1:8 All @ are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not
satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

1:9 The @7 that hath been, it is that @ @ be; and that
@ is done is that @ @ be done: and @ is no new @7
@[ the sun.

1:10 Is @ any @7 whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it
hath been already of old time, @ was @	 us.

1:11 There is no remembrance of former @; @" @ @ be
any remembrance of @ that are to come with @J that @ come
@.

1:12 I the Preacher was king over @ in @ .

1:13 And I gave my @ to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
all @ that are done @[ @1: this sore travail hath God
@= to the sons of man to be exercised @with.

1:14 I have seen all the works that are done @[ the sun; and,
@%, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

1:15 That @ is crooked cannot be made straight: and that @ is
wanting cannot be numbered.

1:16 I communed with mine own @, @, Lo, I am come to @
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
@	 me in @ : yea, my @ had @ experience of wisdom
and knowledge.

1:17 And I gave my @ to know wisdom, and to know madness and
folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow.

2:1 I said in mine @, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
@fore enjoy pleasure: and, @%, this also is vanity.

2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  2:3 I
sought in mine @ to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
@ with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I @B see what was
that good for the sons of men, @ they @# do @[ the @1
all the days of @ life.

2:4 I made me @ works; I builded me @s; I planted me
vineyards: 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in
them of all kind of fruits: 2:6 I made me pools of @Z, to @Z
@with the wood that @(eth @ trees: 2:7 I got me @<s
and maidens, and had @<s born in my @; also I had @
possessions of @ and small cattle above all that were in @ 
@	 me: 2:8 I ga@d me also silver and gold, and the peculiar
treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,
and that of all sorts.

2:9 So I was @, and increased more than all that were @	 me in
@ : also my wisdom remained with me.

2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
not my @ from any joy; for my @ rejoiced in all my labour: and
this was my portion of all my labour.

2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my @D had wrought, and on
the labour that I had laboured to do: and, @%, all was vanity and
vexation of spirit, and @ was no profit @[ the sun.

2:12 And I turned myself to @% wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
what can the man do that cometh @ the king? even that @ hath
been already done.

2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
darkness.

2:14 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them
all.

2:15 Then said I in my @, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my
@, that this also is vanity.

2:16 For @ is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
ever; seeing that @ now is in the days to come @ all be
forgotten.

And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

2:17 @N I hated life; @ the work that is wrought @[
the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour @ I had taken @[ the sun:
@ I @# leave it unto the man that @ be @ me.

2:19 And who knoweth whether he @ be a wise man or a fool? yet
@ he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and
wherein I have shewed myself wise @[ the sun. This is also vanity.

2:20 @N I went @+ to cause my @ to despair of all the
labour @ I took @[ the sun.

2:21 For @ is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,
and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured @in @ he
leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a @ evil.

2:22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
@, wherein he hath laboured @[ the sun?  2:23 For all his days
are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his @ taketh not rest in
the night. This is also vanity.

2:24 There is no@7 better for a man, than that he @# eat and
@b, and that he @# make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This
also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and
to heap up, that he may give to him that is good @	 God. This also
is vanity and vexation of spirit.

3:1 To @ @7 @ is a season, and a time to @ purpose
@[ the @1: 3:2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to
plant, and a time to pluck up that @ is planted; 3:3 A time to
kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build
up; 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
time to dance; 3:5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather
stones @?; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing; 3:6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and
a time to cast away; 3:7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to
keep silence, and a time to @K; 3:8 A time to love, and a time to
hate; a time of war, and a time of @U.

3:9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
3:10 I have seen the travail, @ God hath @= to the sons of men
to be exercised in it.

3:11 He hath made @ @7 beautiful in his time: also he hath set
the world in @ @, so that no man can find out the work that
God maketh from the beginning to the end.

3:12 I know that @ is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice,
and to do good in his life.

3:13 And also that @ man @# eat and @b, and enjoy the good
of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

3:14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it @ be for ever: no@7
can be put to it, nor any @7 taken from it: and God doeth it, that
men @# fear @	 him.

3:15 That @ hath been is now; and that @ is to be hath already
been; and God requireth that @ is past.

3:16 And moreover I saw @[ the sun the @' of judgment, that
wickedness was @; and the @' of @ceousness, that iniquity
was @.

3:17 I said in mine @, God @ judge the @ceous and the
wicked: for @ is a time @ for @ purpose and for @
work.

3:18 I said in mine @ concerning the estate of the sons of men,
that God @B manifest them, and that they @B see that they
@T are beasts.

3:19 For that @ befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even
one @7 befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the @C; yea,
they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a
beast: for all is vanity.

3:20 All go unto one @'; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
@*.

3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the @?  3:22 Wherefore I
perceive that @ is no@7 better, than that a man @# rejoice
in his own works; for that is his portion: for who @ @( him to
see what @ be @ him?  4:1 So I returned, and considered all
the oppressions that are done @[ the sun: and @% the tears of
such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of
@ oppressors @ was power; but they had no comforter.

4:2 Wherefore I praised the dead @ are already dead more than the
living @ are yet alive.

4:3 Yea, better is he than both they, @ hath not yet been, who
hath not seen the evil work that is done @[ the sun.

4:4 Again, I considered all travail, and @ @c work, that for
this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and
vexation of spirit.

4:5 The fool foldeth his @D @?, and eateth his own @R.

4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the @D full with
travail and vexation of spirit.

4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity @[ the sun.

4:8 There is one alone, and @ is not a second; yea, he hath
@" child nor @X: yet is @ no end of all his labour;
@" is his eye satisfied with riches; @" @
 he, For whom
do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it
is a sore travail.

4:9 Two are better than one; @ they have a good reward for @
labour.

4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not @F to help him up.

4:11 Again, if two lie @?, then they have heat: but how can one
be warm alone?  4:12 And if one prevail @
 him, two @
withstand him; and a @@fold cord is not quickly broken.

4:13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,
who will no more be admonished.

4:14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor.

4:15 I considered all the living @ walk @[ the sun, with the
second child that @ stand up in his stead.

4:16 There is no end of all the @, even of all that have been
@	 them: they also that come @ @ not rejoice in him.
Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

5:1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the @ of God, and be more
ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider
not that they do evil.

5:2 Be not rash with thy @P, and let not @ @ be hasty to
utter any @7 @	 God: for God is in @1, and thou upon @:
@fore let thy @5 be few.

5:3 For a dream cometh @E the multitude of business; and a fool's
@; is known by multitude of @5.

5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath
no pleasure in fools: pay that @ thou hast vowed.

5:5 Better is it that thou @#est not vow, than that thou @#est
vow and not pay.

5:6 Suffer not thy @P to cause thy @R to sin; @" say thou
@	 the angel, that it was an error: wherefore @# God be angry
at thy @;, and destroy the work of @ @D?  5:7 For in the
multitude of dreams and many @5 @ are also divers vanities: but
fear thou God.

5:8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for
he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and @ be higher than
they.

5:9 Moreover the profit of the @ is for all: the king @9 is
served by the field.

5:10 He that loveth silver @ not be satisfied with silver; nor he
that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

5:11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
good is @ to the owners @of, saving the @%ing of them with
@ eyes?  5:12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he
eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep.

5:13 There is a sore evil @ I have seen @[ the sun, namely,
riches kept for the owners @of to @ hurt.

5:14 But @J riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,
and @ is no@7 in his hand.

5:15 As he came @ of his m@C's womb, naked @ he return to
go as he came, and @ take no@7 of his labour, @ he may
carry away in his hand.

5:16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so
@ he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
5:17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow
and wrath with his sickness.

5:18 @. that @ I have seen: it is good and comely for one to
eat and to @b, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he
taketh @[ the sun all the days of his life, @ God giveth him:
for it is his portion.

5:19 Every man also to whom God hath @= riches and wealth, and hath
@= him power to eat @of, and to take his portion, and to
rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

5:20 For he @ not much remember the days of his life; @ God
answereth him in the joy of his @.

6:1 There is an evil @ I have seen @[ the sun, and it is common
@ men: 6:2 A man to whom God hath @= riches, wealth, and
honour, so that he wanteth no@7 for his soul of all that he
desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat @of, but a stranger
eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

6:3 If a man beget an @/ @, and live many @8, so that
the days of his @8 be many, and his soul be not filled with good,
and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is
better than he.

6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his
name @ be covered with darkness.

6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any @7: this hath
more rest than the @C.

6:6 Yea, though he live a @: @8 twice told, yet hath he seen
no good: do not all go to one @'?  6:7 All the labour of man is for
his @P, and yet the appetite is not filled.

6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
that knoweth to walk @	 the living?  6:9 Better is the sight of
the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and
vexation of spirit.

6:10 That @ hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
man: @" may he contend with him that is @Bier than he.

6:11 Seeing @ be many @ that increase vanity, what is man the
better?  6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all
the days of his vain life @ he spendeth as a shadow? for who can
tell a man what @ be @ him @[ the sun?  7:1 A good name is
better than precious ointment; and the day of @^ than the day of
one's birth.

7:2 It is better to go to the @ of mourning, than to go to the
@ of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will
lay it to his @.

7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
countenance the @ is made better.

7:4 The @ of the wise is in the @ of mourning; but the @
of fools is in the @ of mirth.

7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
hear the song of fools.

7:6 For as the crackling of thorns @[ a pot, so is the laughter of
the fool: this also is vanity.

7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
@.

7:8 Better is the end of a @7 than the beginning @of: and the
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

7:9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools.

7:10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better
than @? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it @ is profit to
them that see the sun.

7:12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have
it.

7:13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, @
he hath made crooked?  7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in
the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over @

the @C, to the end that man @# find no@7 @ him.

7:15 All @ have I seen in the days of my vanity: @ is a just
man that perisheth in his @ceousness, and @ is a wicked man
that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

7:16 Be not @ceous over much; @" make thyself over wise: why
@#est thou destroy thyself ?  7:17 Be not over much wicked,
@" be thou foolish: why @#est thou die @	 thy time?  7:18
It is good that thou @#est take hold of this; yea, also from this
withdraw not @ hand: for he that feareth God @ come @ of
them all.

7:19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten @By men @ are
in the city.

7:20 For @ is not a just man upon @, that doeth good, and
sinneth not.

7:21 Also take no heed unto all @5 that are spoken; lest thou hear
thy @< curse thee: 7:22 For oftentimes also @ own @
knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed @Cs.

7:23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
was far from me.

7:24 That @ is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
7:25 I applied mine @ to know, and to search, and to seek out
wisdom, and the reason of @, and to know the wickedness of folly,
even of foolishness and madness: 7:26 And I find more bitter than
@^ the woman, whose @ is snares and nets, and her @D as
bands: whoso pleaseth God @ escape from her; but the sinner @
be taken by her.

7:27 @., this have I @V, @
 the preacher, counting one by
one, to find out the account: 7:28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I
find not: one man @ a @: have I @V; but a woman @ all
@J have I not @V.

7:29 Lo, this only have I @V, that God hath made man up@c; but
they have sought out many inventions.

8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
@7?  a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of
his face @ be changed.

8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard
of the oath of God.

8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil @7;
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

8:4 Where the word of a king is, @ is power: and who may say unto
him, What doest thou?  8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment @ feel no
evil @7: and a wise man's @ discerneth both time and judgment.

8:6 Because to @ purpose @ is time and judgment, @fore the
misery of man is @ upon him.

8:7 For he knoweth not that @ @ be: for who can tell him when
it @ be?  8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit; @" hath he power in the day of @^: and
@ is no discharge in that war; @" @ wickedness deliver
@J that are @= to it.

8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my @ unto @ work that is
done @[ the sun: @ is a time wherein one man ruleth over
@F to his own hurt.

8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
@' of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had
so done: this is also vanity.

8:11 Because sentence @
 an evil work is not executed speedily,
@fore the @ of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
evil.

8:12 Though a sinner do evil an @/ times, and his days be
prolonged, yet surely I know that it @ be well with them that fear
God, @ fear @	 him: 8:13 But it @ not be well with the
wicked, @" @ he prolong his days, @ are as a shadow;
@ he feareth not @	 God.

8:14 There is a vanity @ is done upon the @; that @ be
just men, unto whom it happeneth @$ to the work of the wicked;
@*, @ be wicked men, to whom it happeneth @$ to the work
of the @ceous: I said that this also is vanity.

8:15 Then I commended mirth, @ a man hath no better @7 @[
the sun, than to eat, and to @b, and to be merry: for that @
abide with him of his labour the days of his life, @ God giveth
him @[ the sun.

8:16 When I applied mine @ to know wisdom, and to see the business
that is done upon the @: (for also @ is that @" day nor
night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of
God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done @[ the sun:
@ though a man labour to seek it out, yet he @ not find it;
yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet @ he not be
able to find it.

9:1 For all this I considered in my @ even to declare all this,
that the @ceous, and the wise, and @ works, are in the hand of
God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is @	 them.

9:2 All @ come alike to all: @ is one event to the @ceous,
and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the
good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an
oath.

9:3 This is an evil @ all @ that are done @[ the sun, that
@ is one event unto all: yea, also the @ of the sons of men is
full of evil, and madness is in @ @ while they live, and @
that they go to the dead.

9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living @ is hope: for a
living dog is better than a dead lion.

9:5 For the living know that they @ die: but the dead know not any
@7, @" have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is
forgotten.

9:6 Also @ love, and @ hatred, and @ envy, is now
perished; @" have they any more a portion for ever in any @7
that is done @[ the sun.

9:7 Go thy way, eat thy @d with joy, and @b thy wine with a
merry @; for God now accepteth thy works.

9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
ointment.

9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the
life of thy vanity, @ he hath @= thee @[ the sun, all the
days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy
labour @ thou takest @[ the sun.

9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy @B; for
@ is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
whither thou goest.

9:11 I returned, and saw @[ the sun, that the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, @" yet @d to the wise,
nor yet riches to men of @[standing, nor yet favour to men of
skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken
in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are
the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon
them.

9:13 This wisdom have I seen also @[ the sun, and it seemed @
unto me: 9:14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and
@ came a @ king @
 it, and besieged it, and built @
bulwarks @
 it: 9:15 Now @ was @V in it a poor wise man,
and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that
same poor man.

9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
poor man's wisdom is despised, and his @5 are not @).

9:17 The @5 of wise men are @) in quiet more than the cry of him
that ruleth @ fools.

9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth
much good.

10:1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send @ a
stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for
wisdom and honour.

10:2 A wise man's @ is at his @c hand; but a fool's @ at
his left.

10:3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
faileth him, and he @
 to @ one that he is a fool.

10:4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up @
 thee, leave not thy
@'; for yielding pacifieth @ offences.

10:5 There is an evil @ I have seen @[ the sun, as an error
@ proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 Folly is set in @ dignity,
and the rich sit in low @'.

10:7 I have seen @<s upon horses, and princes walking as @<s
upon the @.

10:8 He that diggeth a pit @ fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
hedge, a serpent @ bite him.

10:9 Whoso removeth stones @ be hurt @with; and he that
cleaveth wood @ be endangered @by.

10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he
put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

10:11 Surely the serpent will bite @S enchantment; and a babbler
is no better.

10:12 The @5 of a wise man's @P are gracious; but the lips of a
fool will swallow up @9.

10:13 The beginning of the @5 of his @P is foolishness: and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness.

10:14 A fool also is full of @5: a man cannot tell what @ be;
and what @ be @ him, who can tell him?  10:15 The labour of
the foolish wearieth @ one of them, @ he knoweth not how to
go to the city.

10:16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
eat in the morning!  10:17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is
the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,
and not for drunkenness!  10:18 By much slothfulness the building
decayeth; and @E idleness of the @D the @ droppeth
@E.

10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all @.

10:20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air @ carry the @;,
and that @ hath wings @ tell the matter.

11:1 Cast thy @d upon the @Zs: for thou @ find it @ many
days.

11:2 Give a portion to @H, and also to eight; for thou knowest not
what evil @ be upon the @.

11:3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty @T upon the
@: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in
the @' where the tree falleth, @ it @ be.

11:4 He that observeth the wind @ not sow; and he that regardeth
the clouds @ not reap.

11:5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou
knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

11:6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
@ hand: for thou knowest not whether @ prosper, either this or
that, or whether they both @ be alike good.

11:7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant @7 it is for the eyes
to @% the sun: 11:8 But if a man live many @8, and rejoice in
them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they @ be
many. All that cometh is vanity.

11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy @ cheer thee
in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of @ @, and in
the sight of @ eyes: but know thou, that for all @ @ God
will @( thee into judgment.

11:10 @N remove sorrow from thy @, and put away evil from
thy @R: for childhood and youth are vanity.

12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil
days come not, nor the @8 draw nigh, when thou @ say, I have no
pleasure in them; 12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or
the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return @ the rain: 12:3
In the day when the keepers of the @ @ tremble, and the strong
men @ bow @T, and the grinders cease @ they are few,
and @J that look out of the windows be darkened, 12:4 And the doors
@ be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low,
and he @ rise up at the @; of the bird, and all the daughters
of musick @ be @ low; 12:5 Also when they @ be afraid of
that @ is high, and fears @ be in the way, and the almond tree
@ flourish, and the grasshopper @ be a burden, and desire
@ fail: @ man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go
@+ the streets: 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the
golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or
the wheel broken at the cistern.

12:7 Then @ the dust return to the @ as it was: and the spirit
@ return unto God who gave it.

12:8 Vanity of vanities, @
 the preacher; all is vanity.

12:9 And moreover, @ the preacher was wise, he still taught the
@ knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in
order many proverbs.

12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable @5: and that @
was written was up@c, even @5 of truth.

12:11 The @5 of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
masters of assemblies, @ are @= from one shepherd.

12:12 And further, by @, my son, be admonished: of making many
books @ is no end; and much study is a weariness of the @R.

12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

12:14 For God @ @( @ work into judgment, with @ secret

The Song of Solomon


1:1 The song of songs, @ is Solomon's.

1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his @P: for thy love is
better than wine.

1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
ointment poured @, @fore do the virgins love thee.

1:4 Draw me, we will run @ thee: the king hath @ me into his
chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy
love more than wine: the up@c love thee.

1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of @ , as the tents
of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

1:6 Look not upon me, @ I am black, @ the sun hath looked
upon me: my m@C's @ were angry with me; they made me the
keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.

1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why @# I be as one that
turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?  1:8 If thou know not,
O thou fairest @ women, go thy way @ by the footsteps of the
flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
Pharaoh's chariots.

1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains
of gold.

1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth @

1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he @ lie all

1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards
of Engedi.

1:15 @., thou art fair, my love; @%, thou art fair; thou hast
doves' eyes.

1:16 @., thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is
green.

1:17 The beams of our @ are cedar, and our r@s of fir.

2:1 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

2:2 As the lily @ thorns, so is my love @ the daughters.

2:3 As the apple tree @ the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
@ the sons. I sat down @[ his shadow with @ delight, and
his fruit was sweet to my taste.

2:4 He @ me to the banqueting @, and his banner over me was
love.

2:5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of

2:6 His left hand is @[ my head, and his @c hand doth embrace

2:7 I charge you, O ye daughters of @ , by the roes, and by the

2:8 The @; of my beloved! @%, he cometh leaping upon the

2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: @%, he standeth
behind our wall, he looketh @ at the windows, shewing @9
@E the lattice.

2:10 My beloved @0, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair

2:11 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The
flowers appear on the @; the time of the singing of birds is come,
and the @; of the turtle is @) in our land; 2:13 The fig tree

a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

2:14 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret

2:15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
our vines have tender grapes.

2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth @ the lilies.

2:17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,
but I @V him not.

3:2 I will rise now, and go @+ the city in the streets, and in the
broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I
@V him not.

3:3 The watchmen that go @+ the city @V me: to whom I said, Saw
ye him whom my soul loveth?  3:4 It was but a little that I passed
from them, but I @V him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and @L
not let him go, until I had @ him into my m@C's @, and
into the chamber of her that conceived me.

3:5 I charge you, O ye daughters of @ , by the roes, and by the
hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he
please.

3:6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
merchant?  3:7 @. his bed, @ is Solomon's; @@score valiant
men are @+ it, of the valiant of @.

3:8 They all hold @Qs, being expert in war: @ man hath his
@Q upon his thigh @ of fear in the night.

3:9 King Solomon made @9 a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

3:10 He made the pillars @of of silver, the bottom @of of
gold, the covering of it of purple, the @a @of being paved with
love, for the daughters of @ .

3:11 Go @, O ye daughters of Zion, and @% king Solomon with
the crown wherewith his m@C crowned him in the day of his
espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his @.

4:1 @., thou art fair, my love; @%, thou art fair; thou hast
doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that
appear from mount Gilead.

4:2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, @
came up from the washing; whereof @ one bear twins, and none is
barren @ them.

4:3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely:
thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

4:4 Thy neck is like the tower of @ builded for an armoury,
whereon @ hang a @: bucklers, all shields of @By men.

4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, @ feed

4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to
the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; @ is no spot in thee.

4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look
from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

4:9 Thou hast ravished my @, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
ravished my @ with one of @ eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

4:10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
thy love than wine! and the smell of @ ointments than all spices!
4:11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are
@[ thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of
Lebanon.

4:12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
fountain sealed.

4:13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
camphire, with spikenard, 4:14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and
cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all
the chief spices: 4:15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living @Zs,
and streams from Lebanon.

4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
that the spices @of may flow out. Let my beloved come into his
garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have ga@d my
myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have
drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; @b, yea, @b

5:2 I sleep, but my @ waketh: it is the @; of my beloved that
knocketh, @, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops

5:3 I have put off my coat; how @ I put it on? I have washed my
feet; how @ I defile them?  5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the
hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.

5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my @D dropped with myrrh,
and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the
lock.

5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn @9, and
was gone: my soul failed when he @0: I sought him, but I could not
find him; I @, him, but he gave me no answer.

5:7 The watchmen that went @+ the city @V me, they smote me,
they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

5:8 I charge you, O daughters of @ , if ye find my beloved,
that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

5:9 What is thy beloved more than @F beloved, O thou fairest
@ women? what is thy beloved more than @F beloved, that thou

5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black

5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of @Zs, washed

5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

5:14 His @D are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as
b@c ivory overlaid with sapphires.

5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

5:16 His @P is most sweet: yea, he is al@? lovely. This is my

6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest @ women? whither

6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to
feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

6:3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth @ the

6:4 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as @ ,
terrible as an army with banners.

6:5 Turn away @ eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair

6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep @ go up from the washing,

6:10 Who is she that looketh @ as the morning, fair as the moon,
clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?  6:11 I went
down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to
see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.

6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
Amminadib.

6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look

7:1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the

7:2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, @ wanteth not liquor: thy

7:3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

7:4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; @ eyes like the fishpools in

7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of @ head

7:6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!  7:7
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters

7:8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the

7:10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, @ he saw concerning
@ and @  in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of @.

1:2 Hear, O @1s, and give ear, O @: for the LORD hath spoken,
I have nourished and @ up @, and they have rebelled
@
 me.

1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
@ doth not know, my @ doth not consider.

1:4 Ah sinful nation, a @ laden with iniquity, a seed of
evildoers, @ that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD,
they have provoked the Holy One of @ unto anger, they are gone
away backward.

1:5 Why @# ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:
the whole head is sick, and the whole @ faint.

1:6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head @ is no soundness
in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not
been closed, @" bound up, @" mollified with ointment.

1:7 Your country is desolate, your @G are burned with fire: your
land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as
overthrown by strangers.

1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a

1:9 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we

1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the

1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
@
 the LORD: I am full of the @_ @&s of rams, and the fat

1:12 When ye come to appear @	 me, who hath required this at your
hand, to tread my courts?  1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense
is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn
meeting.

1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are
a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

1:15 And when ye spread @ your @D, I will hide mine eyes from

1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from

1:19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye @ eat the good of the land:

5:1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching
his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
5:2 And he fenced it, and ga@d out the stones @of, and planted
it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the @a of it, and

5:3 And now, O inhabitants of @ , and men of @, judge, I

5:4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not

@ be trodden down: 5:6 And I will lay it waste: it @ not be
pruned, nor digged; but @ @ come up briers and thorns: I will

5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the @ of @, and

5:8 Woe unto them that join @ to @, that lay field to field,

5:18 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as

One of @ draw nigh and come, that we may know it!  5:20 Woe unto
them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light,

justify the wicked for reward, and take away the @ceousness of the

5:25 @N is the anger of the LORD kindled @

For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched
out still.

5:26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
hiss unto them from the end of the @: and, @%, they @ come

5:30 And in that day they @ roar @

6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon
a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

6:2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain
he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with
twain he did fly.

6:3 And one cried unto @F, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
LORD of hosts: the whole @ is full of his @Y.

6:4 And the posts of the door moved at the @; of him that cried,
and the @ was filled with smoke.

6:5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; @ I am a man of
unclean lips, and I dwell in the @a of a @ of unclean lips:
for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

6:6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his

@ iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

6:8 Also I @) the @; of the Lord, @, Whom @ I send, and

6:9 And he said, Go, and tell this @, Hear ye indeed, but

6:10 Make the @ of this @ fat, and make @ ears heavy, and
shut @ eyes; lest they see with @ eyes, and hear with @

6:11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he @>, Until the @G be

6:13 But yet in it @ be a tenth, and it @ return, and @ be

7:1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
of Uzziah, king of @, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
son of Remaliah, king of @, went up toward @  to war
@
 it, but could not prevail @

7:2 And it was told the @ of @, @, Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his @ was moved, and the @ of his @, as
the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

7:3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go @ now to meet Ahaz, thou,

in the highway of the fuller's field; 7:4 And say unto him, Take heed,
and be quiet; fear not, @" be faint@ed for the two tails of

7:5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
counsel @

 @, and vex

7:10 Moreover the LORD @0 @* unto Ahaz, @, 7:11 Ask thee a

7:12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, @" will I tempt the LORD.

7:13 And he said, Hear ye now, O @ of @; Is it a small @7

7:17 The LORD @ @( upon thee, and upon thy @, and upon thy

7:18 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the LORD @ hiss

for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

7:19 And they @ come, and @ rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon
all bushes.

7:20 In the same day @ the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head,
and the hair of the feet: and it @ also consume the beard.

7:21 And it @ come to pass in that day, that a man @ nourish a

8:1 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a @ roll, and write
in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

8:2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the @6,
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

8:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.

Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.

8:4 For @	 the child @ have knowledge to cry, My @, and

8:5 The LORD @0 also unto me @*, @, 8:6 Forasmuch as this

8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye @, and ye @ be broken in

8:10 Take counsel @?, and it @ come to nought; @K the

8:11 For the LORD @0 thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed

8:15 And many @ them @ stumble, and fall, and be broken, and

8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law @ my disciples.

8:17 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the

8:18 @., I and the @ whom the LORD hath @= me are for

9:2 The @ that walked in darkness have seen a @ light: they

9:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they

9:4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his

9:18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it @ devour the briers

9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and

10:1 Woe unto them that decree un@ceous decrees, and that write

10:6 I will send him @

10:13 For he @

13:5 They come from a far country, from the end of @1, even the

13:12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than

13:13 @N I will shake the @1s, and the @ @ remove

14:1 For the LORD will have mercy on @], and will yet choose

14:8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,

14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming:

14:12 How art thou fallen from @1, O Lucifer, son of the morning!

14:13 For thou hast said in @ @, I will ascend into @1, I

14:15 Yet thou @ be @ down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

14:16 They that see thee @ narrowly look upon thee, and consider

14:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,

14:20 Thou @ not be joined with them in burial, @ thou hast

14:21 Prepare slaughter for his @ for the iniquity of @

14:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of

14:24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, @, Surely as I have thought,

14:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole @: and

14:27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who @ disannul it?

14:29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, @ the rod of him that

14:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved:

14:32 What @ one then answer the messengers of the nation? That

15:1 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid

16:1 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the

16:2 For it @ be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,

16:3 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in

16:4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them

spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

16:5 And in mercy @ the throne be established: and he @ sit

16:7 @N @ Moab howl for Moab, @ one @ howl: for the

16:8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the

they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered @E the wilderness:
her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

16:9 @N I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
Sibmah: I will @Z thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for
the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.

16:10 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;
and in the vineyards @ @ be no singing, @" @ @ be

16:11 Wherefore my bowels @ sound like an harp for Moab, and mine

16:12 And it @ come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on

16:13 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since

17:4 And in that day it @ come to pass, that the @Y of @]

17:12 Woe to the multitude of many @, @ make a noise like the

This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that

18:4 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will

all the beasts of the @ @ winter upon them.

18:7 In that time @ the present be @ unto the LORD of hosts
of a @ scattered and peeled, and from a @ terrible from
@ beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden @[ foot,
whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the @' of the name of the
LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

19:1 The burden of @-. @., the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,
and @ come into @-: and the idols of @- @ be moved at
his presence, and the @ of @- @ melt in the @a of it.

19:2 And I will set the @-ians @
 the @-ians: and they
@ fight @ one @

19:3 And the spirit of @- @ fail in the @a @of; and I

the wizards.

19:4 And the @-ians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
and a fierce king @ rule over them, @
 the Lord, the LORD of
hosts.

19:5 And the @Zs @ fail from the sea, and the river @ be
wasted and dried up.

19:6 And they @ turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
defence @ be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags @
wither.

19:7 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the @P of the brooks, and
@ @7 sown by the brooks, @ wither, be driven away, and be
no more.

19:8 The fishers also @ mourn, and all they that cast angle into
the brooks @ lament, and they that spread nets upon the @Zs
@ languish.

19:9 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
networks, @ be con@Ved.

19:10 And they @ be broken in the purposes @of, all that make
sluices and ponds for fish.

19:11 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I
am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?  19:12 Where are
they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them
know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon @-.

19:13 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
deceived; they have also seduced @-, even they that are the stay of
the tribes @of.

19:14 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the @a @of:
and they have caused @- to err in @ work @of, as a drunken
man staggereth in his vomit.

19:15 Neither @ @ be any work for @-, @ the head or

19:16 In that day @ @- be like unto women: and it @ be
afraid and fear @ of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of

19:17 And the land of @ @ be a terror unto @-, @ one

19:18 In that day @ five @G in the land of @- @K the

@,, The city of destruction.

19:19 In that day @ @ be an @\ to the LORD in the @a of

19:20 And it @ be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of

19:21 And the LORD @ be known to @-, and the @-ians @

they @ vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.

19:22 And the LORD @ smite @-: he @ smite and heal it: and
they @ return even to the LORD, and he @ be intreated of them,

19:23 In that day @ @ be a highway out of @- to Assyria,
and the Assyrian @ come into @-, and the @-ian into Assyria,
and the @-ians @ serve with the Assyrians.

19:24 In that day @ @ be the third with @- and with
Assyria, even a blessing in the @a of the land: 19:25 Whom the LORD
of hosts @ bless, @, Blessed be @- my @, and Assyria
the work of my @D, and @ mine inheritance.

20:1 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king
of Assyria sent him,) and fought @
 Ashdod, and took it; 20:2 At
the same time @0 the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, @, Go and
loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy
foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

20:3 And the LORD said, Like as my @< Isaiah hath walked naked
and barefoot @@ @8 for a sign and wonder upon @- and upon
Ethiopia; 20:4 So @ the king of Assyria lead away the @-ians
prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and
barefoot, even with @ buttocks uncovered, to the shame of @-.

20:5 And they @ be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia @
expectation, and of @- @ @Y.

20:6 And the inhabitant of this isle @ say in that day, @.,
such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from
the king of Assyria: and how @ we escape?  21:1 The burden of the
desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass @E; so it
cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

21:2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam:
besiege, O Media; all the sighing @of have I made to cease.

21:3 @N are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at
the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

21:4 My @ panted, fearfulness aff@ced me: the night of my
pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

21:5 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, @b: arise, ye
princes, and anoint the shield.

21:6 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him
declare what he seeth.

21:7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much
heed: 21:8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 21:9
And, @%, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.

And he @> and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the
graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

21:10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that @ I have
@) of the LORD of hosts, the God of @, have I declared unto
you.

21:11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?  21:12 The watchman
said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire,
enquire ye: return, come.

21:13 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia @ ye lodge,
O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

21:14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema @ @Z to him that
was thirsty, they prevented with @ @d him that fled.

21:15 For they fled from the @Qs, from the drawn @Q, and from
the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

21:16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, @$ to
the @8 of an hireling, and all the @Y of Kedar @ fail: 21:17
And the residue of the number of archers, the @By men of the
@ of Kedar, @ be diminished: for the LORD God of @
hath spoken it.

22:1 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
thou art wholly gone up to the @tops?  22:2 Thou that art full of
stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy slain men are not slain
with the @Q, nor dead in battle.

22:3 All thy rulers are fled @?, they are bound by the archers:
all that are @V in thee are bound @?, @ have fled from
far.

22:4 @N said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour
not to comfort me, @ of the spoiling of the daughter of my
@.

22:5 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking
down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

22:6 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and
Kir uncovered the shield.

22:7 And it @ come to pass, that thy choicest valleys @ be
full of chariots, and the horsemen @ set @T in array at
the gate.

22:8 And he discovered the covering of @, and thou didst look in
that day to the armour of the @ of the forest.

22:9 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of @, that they
are many: and ye ga@d @? the @Zs of the lower pool.

22:10 And ye have numbered the @s of @ , and the @s
have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

22:11 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the @Z of the
old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker @of, @" had
respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

22:12 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 22:13 And
@% joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating
@R, and @bing wine: let us eat and @b; for to morrow we @
die.

22:14 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
this iniquity @ not be purged from you till ye die, @
 the Lord
GOD of hosts.

22:15 Thus @
 the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
treasurer, even unto Shebna, @ is over the @, and say, 22:16
What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed
thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on
high, and that graveth an habitation for @9 in a rock?  22:17
@., the LORD will carry thee away with a @By captivity, and
will surely cover thee.

22:18 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
large country: @ @ thou die, and @ the chariots of thy
@Y @ be the shame of thy lord's @.

22:19 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state @
he pull thee down.

22:20 And it @ come to pass in that day, that I will call my
@< Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 22:21 And I will clothe him with
thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy
government into his hand: and he @ be a @ to the inhabitants
of @ , and to the @ of @.

22:22 And the key of the @ of @ will I lay upon his @#er;
so he @ open, and none @ shut; and he @ shut, and none
@ open.

22:23 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure @'; and he @ be
for a glorious throne to his @'s @.

22:24 And they @ hang upon him all the @Y of his @'s
@, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity,
from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.

22:25 In that day, @
 the LORD of hosts, @ the nail that is
fastened in the sure @' be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and
the burden that was upon it @ be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken
it.

23:1 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
waste, so that @ is no @, no entering in: from the land of
Chittim it is revealed to them.

23:2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of
Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

23:3 And by @ @Zs the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,
is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

23:4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
strength of the sea, @, I travail not, nor @( @ @,
@" do I nourish up young men, nor @( up virgins.

23:5 As at the report concerning @-, so @ they be sorely pained
at the report of Tyre.

23:6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

23:7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her
own feet @ carry her afar off to sojourn.

23:8 Who hath taken this counsel @
 Tyre, the crowning city,
whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of
the @?  23:9 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the
pride of all @Y, and to @( into contempt all the honourable of
the @.

23:10 Pass @E thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: @
is no more strength.

23:11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
the LORD hath @= a commandment @
 the merchant city, to
destroy the strong holds @of.

23:12 And he said, Thou @ no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; @ also
@ thou have no rest.

23:13 @. the land of the Chaldeans; this @ was not, till the
Assyrian @Ved it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up
the towers @of, they raised up the palaces @of; and he @

23:14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

23:15 And it @ come to pass in that day, that Tyre @ be
forgotten @Hty @8, @$ to the days of one king: @ the
end of @Hty @8 @ Tyre sing as an harlot.

23:16 Take an harp, go @+ the city, thou harlot that hast been
forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be
remembered.

23:17 And it @ come to pass @ the end of @Hty @8, that
the LORD will visit Tyre, and she @ turn to her hire, and @
commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of
the @.

23:18 And her merchandise and her hire @ be holiness to the LORD:
it @ not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise @ be
for them that dwell @	 the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for
durable clo@7.

24:1 @., the LORD maketh the @ empty, and maketh it waste, and
turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants @of.

24:2 And it @ be, as with the @, so with the @6; as with
the @<, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her
mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender,
so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of
usury to him.

24:3 The land @ be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the
LORD hath spoken this word.

24:4 The @ mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
fadeth away, the haughty @ of the @ do languish.

24:5 The @ also is defiled @[ the inhabitants @of; @
they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the
everlasting covenant.

24:6 @N hath the curse devoured the @, and they that dwell
@in are desolate: @fore the inhabitants of the @ are
burned, and few men left.

24:7 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry@ed
do sigh.

24:8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

24:9 They @ not @b wine with a song; strong @b @ be
bitter to them that @b it.

24:10 The city of confusion is broken down: @ @ is shut up,
that no man may come in.

24:11 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened,
the mirth of the land is gone.

24:12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
destruction.

24:13 When thus it @ be in the @a of the land @ the @,
@ @ be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning
grapes when the vintage is done.

24:14 They @ lift up @ @;, they @ sing for the majesty
of the LORD, they @ cry aloud from the sea.

24:15 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the
LORD God of @ in the isles of the sea.

24:16 From the uttermost part of the @ have we @) songs, even
@Y to the @ceous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto
me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the
treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

24:17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of
the @.

24:18 And it @ come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
the fear @ fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the
@a of the pit @ be taken in the snare: for the windows from on
high are open, and the @Vations of the @ do shake.

24:19 The @ is utterly broken down, the @ is clean dissolved,
the @ is moved exceedingly.

24:20 The @ @ reel to and fro like a drunkard, and @ be
removed like a cottage; and the transgression @of @ be heavy
upon it; and it @ fall, and not rise @*.

24:21 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the LORD @
punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of
the @ upon the @.

24:22 And they @ be ga@d @?, as prisoners are ga@d
in the pit, and @ be shut up in the prison, and @ many days
@ they be visited.

24:23 Then the moon @ be con@Ved, and the sun ashamed, when the
LORD of hosts @ reign in mount Zion, and in @ , and @	
his ancients gloriously.

25:1 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
name; for thou hast done wonderful @; thy counsels of old are
faithfulness and truth.

25:2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin:
a palace of strangers to be no city; it @ never be built.

25:3 @N @ the strong @ glorify thee, the city of the
terrible nations @ fear thee.

25:4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the
heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm @
 the
wall.

25:5 Thou @ @( down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
dry @'; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the
terrible ones @ be @ low.

25:6 And in this mountain @ the LORD of hosts make unto all @
a feast of fat @, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat @
full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

25:7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
cast over all @, and the vail that is spread over all nations.

25:8 He will swallow up @^ in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe
away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his @ @ he
take away from off all the @: for the LORD hath spoken it.

25:9 And it @ be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited
for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

25:10 For in this mountain @ the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
@ be trodden down @[ him, even as straw is trodden down for the
dunghill.

25:11 And he @ spread @ his @D in the @a of them, as he
that swimmeth spreadeth @ his @D to swim: and he @ @(
down @ pride @? with the spoils of @ @D.

25:12 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls @ he @(

26:1 In that day @ this song be sung in the land of @; We have
a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.

26:2 Open ye the gates, that the @ceous nation @ keepeth the
truth may enter in.

26:3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect @U, whose mind is stayed on
thee: @ he trusteth in thee.

26:4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
everlasting strength: 26:5 For he @(eth down them that dwell on
high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the
ground; he @(eth it even to the dust.

26:6 The foot @ tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the
steps of the needy.

26:7 The way of the just is up@cness: thou, most up@c, dost
weigh the path of the just.

26:8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of
thee.

26:9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in
the @, the inhabitants of the world will learn @ceousness.

26:10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
@ceousness: in the land of up@cness will he deal unjustly, and
will not @% the majesty of the LORD.

26:11 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
@ see, and be ashamed for @ envy at the @; yea, the fire
of @ enemies @ devour them.

26:12 LORD, thou wilt ordain @U for us: for thou also hast wrought
all our works in us.

26:13 O LORD our God, @C lords beside thee have had dominion over
us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

26:14 They are dead, they @ not live; they are deceased, they
@ not rise: @fore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and
made all @ memory to perish.

26:15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the
ends of the @.

26:16 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

26:17 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in
thy sight, O LORD.

26:18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it

@; @" have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

26:19 Thy dead men @ live, @? with my dead body @ they
arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the
dew of herbs, and the @ @ cast out the dead.

26:20 Come, my @, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
doors @+ thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until
the indignation be overpast.

26:21 For, @%, the LORD cometh out of his @' to punish the
inhabitants of the @ for @ iniquity: the @ also @
disclose her @I, and @ no more cover her slain.

27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and @ and strong @Q
@ punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that
crooked serpent; and he @ slay the dragon that is in the sea.

27:2 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

27:3 I the LORD do keep it; I will @Z it @ moment: lest any
hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

27:4 Fury is not in me: who @L set the briers and thorns @
 me
in battle? I @L go @E them, I @L burn them @?.

27:5 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make @U with
me; and he @ make @U with me.

27:6 He @ cause them that come of @] to take root: @ @
blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.

27:7 Hath he smitten him, as he smote @J that smote him? or is he
slain @$ to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?  27:8
In measure, when it shooteth @, thou wilt debate with it: he
stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

27:9 By this @fore @ the iniquity of @] be purged; and this
is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones
of the @\ as chalkstones that are beaten in s@[, the groves and

27:10 Yet the defenced city @ be desolate, and the habitation

@ @ he lie down, and consume the branches @of.

27:11 When the boughs @of are wi@d, they @ be broken off:
the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a @ of no

27:12 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the LORD @ beat
off from the channel of the river unto the stream of @-, and ye

27:13 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the @ trumpet

land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of @-, and @

28:1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
glorious beauty is a fading flower, @ are on the head of the fat
valleys of them that are overcome with wine!  28:2 @., the Lord
hath a @By and strong one, @ as a tempest of hail and a
destroying storm, as a flood of @By @Zs overflowing, @ cast
down to the @ with the hand.

28:3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, @ be trodden
@[ feet: 28:4 And the glorious beauty, @ is on the head of the
fat valley, @ be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit @	
the summer; @ when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet
in his hand he eateth it up.

28:5 In that day @ the LORD of hosts be for a crown of @Y, and
for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his @, 28:6 And for a
spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength
to them that turn the battle to the gate.

28:7 But they also have erred @E wine, and @E strong @b
are out of the way; the @6 and the prophet have erred @E
strong @b, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way
@E strong @b; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

28:8 For all tables are full of vomit and fil@ss, so that @ is
no @' clean.

28:9 Whom @ he teach knowledge? and whom @ he make to
@[stand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn
from the breasts.

28:10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
upon line, line upon line; here a little, and @ a little: 28:11
For with stammering lips and @F tongue will he @K to this
@.

28:12 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they @L not hear.

28:13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little,
and @ a little; that they @B go, and fall backward, and be
broken, and snared, and taken.

28:14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule
this @ @ is in @ .

28:15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with @^, and
with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge @ pass
@E, it @ not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge,
and @[ falsehood have we hid ourselves: 28:16 @N thus @

the Lord GOD, @., I lay in Zion for a @Vation a stone, a tried
stone, a precious corner stone, a sure @Vation: he that believeth
@ not make haste.

28:17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and @ceousness to the
plummet: and the hail @ sweep away the refuge of lies, and the
@Zs @ overflow the hiding @'.

28:18 And your covenant with @^ @ be disannulled, and your
agreement with hell @ not stand; when the overflowing scourge
@ pass @E, then ye @ be trodden down by it.

28:19 From the time that it goeth @ it @ take you: for morning
by morning @ it pass over, by day and by night: and it @ be a
vexation only to @[stand the report.

28:20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch @9 on
it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap @9 in it.

28:21 For the LORD @ rise up as in mount Perazim, he @ be
wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange
work; and @( to pass his act, his strange act.

28:22 Now @fore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:
for I have @) from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even
determined upon the whole @.

28:23 Give ye ear, and hear my @;; hearken, and hear my speech.

28:24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
clods of his ground?  28:25 When he hath made plain the face @of,
doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast
in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in @
@'?  28:26 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth
teach him.

28:27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
@" is a cart wheel turned @+ upon the cummin; but the fitches
are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

28:28 Bread corn is bruised; @ he will not ever be threshing it,
nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his
horsemen.

28:29 This also cometh @ from the LORD of hosts, @ is
wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

29:1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where @ dwelt! add ye year
to year; let them kill sacrifices.

29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and @ @ be heaviness and
sorrow: and it @ be unto me as Ariel.

29:3 And I will camp @
 thee round @+, and will lay siege
@
 thee with a mount, and I will raise forts @
 thee.

29:4 And thou @ be @ down, and @ @K out of the
ground, and thy speech @ be low out of the dust, and thy @;
@ be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
and thy speech @ whisper out of the dust.

29:5 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers @ be like small dust,
and the multitude of the terrible ones @ be as chaff that passeth
away: yea, it @ be at an instant suddenly.

29:6 Thou @ be visited of the LORD of hosts with th@[, and with
@quake, and @ noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of
devouring fire.

29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight @
 Ariel,
even all that fight @
 her and her munition, and that distress
her, @ be as a dream of a night vision.

29:8 It @ even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, @%, he
eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty
man dreameth, and, @%, he @beth; but he awaketh, and, @%,
he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so @ the multitude of all
the nations be, that fight @
 mount Zion.

29:9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong @b.

29:10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers
hath he covered.

29:11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the @5 of a book
that is sealed, @ men deliver to one that is learned, @, Read
this, I pray thee: and he @
, I cannot; for it is sealed: 29:12 And
the book is delivered to him that is not learned, @, Read this, I
pray thee: and he @
, I am not learned.

29:13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this @ draw near me
with @ @P, and with @ lips do honour me, but have removed
@ @ far from me, and @ fear toward me is taught by the
precept of men: 29:14 @N, @%, I will proceed to do a
marvellous work @ this @, even a marvellous work and a
wonder: for the wisdom of @ wise men @ perish, and the
@[standing of @ prudent men @ be hid.

29:15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide @ counsel from the
LORD, and @ works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and
who knoweth us?  29:16 Surely your turning of @ upside down @
be esteemed as the potter's clay: for @ the work say of him that
made it, He made me not? or @ the @7 framed say of him that
framed it, He had no @[standing?  29:17 Is it not yet a very little
while, and Lebanon @ be turned into a fruitful field, and the
fruitful field @ be esteemed as a forest?  29:18 And in that day
@ the deaf hear the @5 of the book, and the eyes of the blind
@ see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

29:19 The meek also @ increase @ joy in the LORD, and the poor
@ men @ rejoice in the Holy One of @.

29:20 For the terrible one is @ to nought, and the scorner is
consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 29:21 That make
a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth
in the gate, and turn aside the just for a @7 of nought.

29:22 @N thus @
 the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
the @ of @], @] @ not now be ashamed, @" @ his
face now wax pale.

29:23 But when he seeth his @, the work of mine @D, in the
@a of him, they @ sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One
of @], and @ fear the God of @.

29:24 They also that erred in spirit @ come to @[standing, and
they that murmured @ learn doctrine.

30:1 Woe to the rebellious @, @
 the LORD, that take
counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my
spirit, that they may add sin to sin: 30:2 That walk to go down into
@-, and have not asked at my @P; to strengthen @T in the
strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of @-!  30:3
@N @ the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust
in the shadow of @- your confusion.

30:4 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

30:5 They were all ashamed of a @ that could not profit them, nor
be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

30:6 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble
and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and
fiery flying serpent, they will carry @ riches upon the @#ers
of young asses, and @ treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a
@ that @ not profit them.

30:7 For the @-ians @ help in vain, and to no purpose:
@fore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit
still.

30:8 Now go, write it @	 them in a table, and note it in a book,
that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 30:9 That this
is a rebellious @, lying @, @ that will not hear
the law of the LORD: 30:10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the
prophets, Prophesy not unto us @c @, @K unto us smooth
@, prophesy deceits: 30:11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out
of the path, cause the Holy One of @ to cease from @	 us.

30:12 Wherefore thus @
 the Holy One of @, Because ye despise
this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay @on:
30:13 @N this iniquity @ be to you as a breach ready to
fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at
an instant.

30:14 And he @ break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
that is broken in pieces; he @ not spare: so that @ @ not
be @V in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the @h,
or to take @Z withal out of the pit.

30:15 For thus @
 the Lord GOD, the Holy One of @; In
returning and rest @ ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence
@ be your strength: and ye @L not.

30:16 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; @fore @
ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; @fore @ they that
pursue you be swift.

30:17 One @: @ flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
five @ ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a
mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

30:18 And @fore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
you, and @fore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon
you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait
for him.

30:19 For the @ @ dwell in Zion at @ : thou @ weep
no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the @; of thy cry;
when he @ hear it, he will answer thee.

30:20 And though the Lord give you the @d of adversity, and the
@Z of affliction, yet @ not thy teachers be removed into a
corner any more, but @ eyes @ see thy teachers: 30:21 And
@ ears @ hear a word behind thee, @, This is the way,
walk ye in it, when ye turn to the @c hand, and when ye turn to the
left.

30:22 Ye @ defile also the covering of thy graven images of
silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou @ cast
them away as a menstruous cloth; thou @ say unto it, Get thee
hence.

30:23 Then @ he give the rain of thy seed, that thou @ sow the
ground withal; and @d of the increase of the @, and it @ be
fat and plenteous: in that day @ thy cattle feed in large
pastures.

30:24 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground @
eat clean provender, @ hath been winnowed with the shovel and with
the fan.

30:25 And @ @ be upon @ high mountain, and upon @ high
hill, rivers and streams of @Zs in the day of the @ slaughter,
when the towers fall.

30:26 Moreover the light of the moon @ be as the light of the sun,
and the light of the sun @ be @Hfold, as the light of @H
days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his @,
and healeth the stroke of @ wound.

30:27 @., the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
anger, and the burden @of is heavy: his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 30:28 And his breath,
as an overflowing stream, @ reach to the @a of the neck, to
sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and @ @ be a bridle
in the jaws of the @, causing them to err.

30:29 Ye @ have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
kept; and gladness of @, as when one goeth with a pipe to come
into the mountain of the LORD, to the @By One of @.

30:30 And the LORD @ cause his glorious @; to be @), and
@ shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his
anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and
tempest, and hailstones.

30:31 For @E the @; of the LORD @ the Assyrian be beaten
down, @ smote with a rod.

30:32 And in @ @' where the grounded staff @ pass, @
the LORD @ lay upon him, it @ be with tabrets and harps: and
in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

30:33 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;
he hath made it deep and large: the pile @of is fire and much
wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle
it.

31:1 Woe to them that go down to @- for help; and stay on horses,
and trust in chariots, @ they are many; and in horsemen, @
they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of @,
@" seek the LORD!  31:2 Yet he also is wise, and will @( evil,
and will not call back his @5: but will arise @
 the @ of
the evildoers, and @
 the help of them that work iniquity.

31:3 Now the @-ians are men, and not God; and @ horses @R,
and not spirit. When the LORD @ stretch out his hand, both he that
helpeth @ fall, and he that is holpen @ fall down, and they
all @ fail @?.

31:4 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the
young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is
@, @ @
 him, he will not be afraid of @ @;, nor
abase @9 for the noise of them: so @ the LORD of hosts come
down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill @of.

31:5 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend @ ;
defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve
it.

31:6 Turn ye unto him from whom the @ of @ have deeply
revolted.

31:7 For in that day @ man @ cast away his idols of silver,
and his idols of gold, @ your own @D have made unto you for a
sin.

31:8 Then @ the Assyrian fall with the @Q, not of a @By man;
and the @Q, not of a mean man, @ devour him: but he @ flee
from the @Q, and his young men @ be discomfited.

31:9 And he @ pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
princes @ be afraid of the ensign, @
 the LORD, whose fire is
in Zion, and his furnace in @ .

32:1 @., a king @ reign in @ceousness, and princes @
rule in judgment.

32:2 And a man @ be as an hiding @' from the wind, and a covert
from the tempest; as rivers of @Z in a dry @', as the shadow of
a @ rock in a weary land.

32:3 And the eyes of them that see @ not be dim, and the ears of
them that hear @ hearken.

32:4 The @ also of the rash @ @[stand knowledge, and the
tongue of the stammerers @ be ready to @K plainly.

32:5 The vile person @ be no more @, liberal, nor the churl
said to be bountiful.

32:6 For the vile person will @K villany, and his @ will work
iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error @
 the LORD,
to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the @b of
the thirsty to fail.

32:7 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying @5, even when the needy
@Keth @c.

32:8 But the liberal deviseth liberal @; and by liberal @
@ he stand.

32:9 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my @;, ye careless
daughters; give ear unto my speech.

32:10 Many days and @8 @ ye be troubled, ye careless women: for
the vintage @ fail, the gathering @ not come.

32:11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your
loins.

32:12 They @ lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
the fruitful vine.

32:13 Upon the land of my @ @ come up thorns and briers; yea,
upon all the @s of joy in the joyous city: 32:14 Because the
palaces @ be forsaken; the multitude of the city @ be left;
the forts and towers @ be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses,
a pasture of flocks; 32:15 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on
high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field
be counted for a forest.

32:16 Then judgment @ dwell in the wilderness, and @ceousness
remain in the fruitful field.

32:17 And the work of @ceousness @ be @U; and the effect of
@ceousness quietness and assurance for ever.

32:18 And my @ @ dwell in a @Uable habitation, and in sure
dwellings, and in quiet resting @'s; 32:19 When it @ hail,
coming down on the forest; and the city @ be low in a low @'.

32:20 Blessed are ye that sow beside all @Zs, that send @
thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

33:1 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou
@ cease to spoil, thou @ be spoiled; and when thou @ make
an end to deal treacherously, they @ deal treacherously with thee.

33:2 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
@ arm @ morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

33:3 At the noise of the tumult the @ fled; at the lifting up of
thyself the nations were scattered.

33:4 And your spoil @ be ga@d like the gathering of the
caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts @ he run upon

33:5 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion
with judgment and @ceousness.

33:6 And wisdom and knowledge @ be the stability of thy times, and
strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.

33:7 @., @ valiant ones @ cry @S: the ambassadors of
@U @ weep bitterly.

33:8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken
the covenant, he hath despised the @G, he regardeth no man.

33:9 The @ mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn
down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off
@ fruits.

33:10 Now will I rise, @
 the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will
I lift up myself.

33:11 Ye @ conceive chaff, ye @ @( @ stubble: your
breath, as fire, @ devour you.

33:12 And the @ @ be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
up @ they be burned in the fire.

33:13 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
near, acknowledge my @B.

33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
hypocrites. Who @ us @ dwell with the devouring fire? who
@ us @ dwell with everlasting burnings?  33:15 He that walketh
@ceously, and @Keth up@cly; he that despiseth the gain of
oppressions, that shaketh his @D from holding of bribes, that
stoppeth his ears from hearing of @I, and shutteth his eyes from
seeing evil; 33:16 He @ dwell on high: his @' of defence @
be the munitions of rocks: @d @ be @= him; his @Zs @
be sure.

33:17 Thine eyes @ see the king in his beauty: they @ @%
the land that is very far off.

33:18 Thine @ @ meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is
the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?  33:19 Thou @
not see a fierce @, a @ of a deeper speech than thou canst
perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not @[stand.

33:20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: @ eyes @
see @  a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that @ not be taken
down; not one of the stakes @of @ ever be removed, @"
@ any of the cords @of be broken.

33:21 But @ the glorious LORD will be unto us a @' of broad
rivers and streams; wherein @ go no galley with oars, @"
@ gallant ship pass @by.

33:22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is
our king; he will save us.

33:23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen @
mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a @
spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

33:24 And the inhabitant @ not say, I am sick: the @ that
dwell @in @ be for@= @ iniquity.

34:1 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye @: let the
@ hear, and all that is @in; the world, and all @ that
come @ of it.

34:2 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury
upon all @ armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath
delivered them to the slaughter.

34:3 Their slain also @ be cast out, and @ stink @ come up
out of @ carcases, and the mountains @ be melted with @
@I.

34:4 And all the host of @1 @ be dissolved, and the @1s
@ be rolled @? as a scroll: and all @ host @ fall
down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from
the fig tree.

34:5 For my @Q @ be bathed in @1: @%, it @ come
down upon Idumea, and upon the @ of my curse, to judgment.

34:6 The @Q of the LORD is filled with @I, it is made fat with
fatness, and with the @I of lambs and goats, with the fat of the
kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a @
slaughter in the land of Idumea.

34:7 And the unicorns @ come down with them, and the bullocks with
the bulls; and @ land @ be soaked with @I, and @ dust
made fat with fatness.

34:8 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
recompences for the controversy of Zion.

34:9 And the streams @of @ be turned into pitch, and the dust
@of into brimstone, and the land @of @ become burning
pitch.

34:10 It @ not be quenched night nor day; the smoke @of @
go up for ever: from generation to generation it @ lie waste; none
@ pass @E it for ever and ever.

34:11 But the cormorant and the bittern @ possess it; the owl also
and the raven @ dwell in it: and he @ stretch out upon it the
line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

34:12 They @ call the nobles @of to the kingdom, but none

34:13 And thorns @ come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in
the fortresses @of: and it @ be an habitation of dragons, and
a court for owls.

34:14 The wild beasts of the desert @ also meet with the wild
beasts of the island, and the satyr @ cry to his fellow; the

rest.

34:15 There @ the @ owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and

34:16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of @
@ fail, none @ want her mate: for my @P it hath @M,
and his spirit it hath ga@d them.

34:17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it
unto them by line: they @ possess it for ever, from generation to
generation @ they dwell @in.

35:1 The wilderness and the solitary @' @ be glad for them; and
the desert @ rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

35:2 It @ blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
singing: the @Y of Lebanon @ be @= unto it, the excellency
of Carmel and Sharon, they @ see the @Y of the LORD, and the
excellency of our God.

35:3 Strengthen ye the weak @D, and confirm the feeble knees.

35:4 Say to them that are of a fearful @, Be strong, fear not:
@%, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence;
he will come and save you.

35:5 Then the eyes of the blind @ be opened, and the ears of the
deaf @ be unstopped.

35:6 Then @ the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
dumb sing: for in the wilderness @ @Zs break out, and streams
in the desert.

35:7 And the parched ground @ become a pool, and the thirsty land
springs of @Z: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, @

35:8 And an highway @ be @, and a way, and it @ be @,
The way of holiness; the unclean @ not pass over it; but it @

35:9 No lion @ be @, nor any ravenous beast @ go up

36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
Sennacherib king of Assyria came up @
 all the defenced @G of
@, and took them.

36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to @ 
unto king Hezekiah with a @ army. And he stood by the conduit of
the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.

36:3 Then came @ unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, @ was over
the @, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.

36:4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus @

the @ king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein
thou trustest?  36:5 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain @5)
I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that
thou rebellest @
 me?  36:6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of
this broken reed, on @-; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his
hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of @- to all that trust in
him.

36:7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
he, whose high @'s and whose @\s Hezekiah hath taken away, and
said to @ and to @ , Ye @ worship @	 this @\?
36:8 Now @fore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
Assyria, and I will give thee two @: horses, if thou be able on
thy part to set riders upon them.

36:9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
of my master's @<s, and put thy trust on @- for chariots and
for horsemen?  36:10 And am I now come up @S the LORD @

this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up @
 this
land, and destroy it.

36:11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
pray thee, unto thy @<s in the Syrian language; for we @[stand
it: and @K not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the
@ that are on the wall.

36:12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to
thee to @K @ @5? hath he not sent me to the men that sit
upon the wall, that they may eat @ own dung, and @b @ own
piss with you?  36:13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud
@; in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the @5 of the @
king, the king of Assyria.

36:14 Thus @
 the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he @
not be able to deliver you.

36:15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, @, The
LORD will surely deliver us: this city @ not be delivered into the
hand of the king of Assyria.

36:16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus @
 the king of Assyria,
Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye
@ one of his vine, and @ one of his fig tree, and @b ye
@ one the @Zs of his own cistern; 36:17 Until I come and take
you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land
of @d and vineyards.

36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, @, the LORD will deliver
us.

Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand
of the king of Assyria?  36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and
Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered
Samaria out of my hand?  36:20 Who are they @ all the gods of
@ lands, that have delivered @ land out of my hand, that the
LORD @# deliver @  out of my hand?  36:21 But they held
@ @U, and @> him not a word: for the king's commandment
was, @, Answer him not.

36:22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
@hold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the
recorder, to Hezekiah with @ clothes rent, and told him the @5
of Rabshakeh.

37:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah @) it, that he rent
his clothes, and covered @9 with sackcloth, and went into the
@ of the LORD.

37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the @hold, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the @6s covered with sackcloth, unto
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

37:3 And they said unto him, Thus @
 Hezekiah, This day is a day of
trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the @ are come to
the birth, and @ is not strength to @( @.

37:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the @5 of Rabshakeh, whom
the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God,
and will reprove the @5 @ the LORD thy God hath @):
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.

37:5 So the @<s of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

37:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus @ ye say unto your master,
Thus @
 the LORD, Be not afraid of the @5 that thou hast @),
wherewith the @<s of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

37:7 @., I will send a blast upon him, and he @ hear a rumour,
and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the @Q
in his own land.

37:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and @V the king of Assyria warring
@
 Libnah: for he had @) that he was departed from Lachish.

37:9 And he @) say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
@ to make war with thee. And when he @) it, he sent messengers
to Hezekiah, @, 37:10 Thus @ ye @K to Hezekiah king of
@, @, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee,
@, @  @ not be @= into the hand of the king of
Assyria.

37:11 @., thou hast @) what the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly; and @ thou be delivered?
37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them @ my @s
have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the @ of
Eden @ were in Telassar?  37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and
the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and
Ivah?  37:14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the @ of the
LORD, and spread it @	 the LORD.

37:15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, @, 37:16 O LORD of
hosts, God of @, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art
the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the @: thou hast
made @1 and @.

37:17 Incline @ ear, O LORD, and hear; open @ eyes, O LORD,
and see: and hear all the @5 of Sennacherib, @ hath sent to
reproach the living God.

37:18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
nations, and @ countries, 37:19 And have cast @ gods into the
fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's @D, wood and
stone: @fore they have destroyed them.

37:20 Now @fore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
the kingdoms of the @ may know that thou art the LORD, even thou
only.

37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, @, Thus
@
 the LORD God of @, Whereas thou hast prayed to me @

Sennacherib king of Assyria: 37:22 This is the word @ the LORD
hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath
despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of @ 
hath shaken her head at thee.

37:23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and @
 whom hast
thou exalted thy @;, and lifted up @ eyes on high? even @

the Holy One of @.

37:24 By thy @<s hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By
the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the
mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall
cedars @of, and the choice fir trees @of: and I will enter
into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.

37:25 I have digged, and drunk @Z; and with the sole of my feet
have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged @'s.

37:26 Hast thou not @) long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient
times, that I have formed it? now have I @ it to pass, that thou
@#est be to lay waste defenced @G into ruinous heaps.

37:27 @N @ inhabitants were of small power, they were
dismayed and con@Ved: they were as the grass of the field, and as
the green herb, as the grass on the @tops, and as corn blasted
@	 it be grown up.

37:28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
thy rage @
 me.

37:29 Because thy rage @
 me, and thy tumult, is come up into
mine ears, @fore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in
thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by @ thou camest.

37:30 And this @ be a sign unto thee, Ye @ eat this year such
as groweth of itself; and the second year that @ springeth of the
same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and
eat the fruit @of.

37:31 And the remnant that is escaped of the @ of @ @
@* take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 37:32 For out of
@  @ go @ a remnant, and they that escape out of mount
Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts @ do this.

37:33 @N thus @
 the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
@ not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow @, nor come
@	 it with shields, nor cast a bank @
 it.

37:34 By the way that he came, by the same @ he return, and @
not come into this city, @
 the LORD.

37:35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
for my @< @'s sake.

37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went @, and smote in the camp of
the Assyrians a @/ and fourscore and five @:: and when they
arose early in the morning, @%, they were all dead corpses.

37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
and dwelt at Nineveh.

37:38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the @ of
Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with
the @Q; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead.

38:1 In @J days was Hezekiah sick unto @^. And Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus @

the LORD, Set @ @ in order: for thou @ die, and not live.

38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
the LORD, 38:3 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I
have walked @	 thee in truth and with a perfect @, and have
done that @ is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

38:4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, @, 38:5 Go, and
say to Hezekiah, Thus @
 the LORD, the God of @ thy @, I
have @) thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: @%, I will add unto
thy days fifteen @8.

38:6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

38:7 And this @ be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD
will do this @7 that he hath spoken; 38:8 @., I will @(
@* the shadow of the degrees, @ is gone down in the sun dial of
Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by @
degrees it was gone down.

38:9 The writing of Hezekiah king of @, when he had been sick, and
was recovered of his sickness: 38:10 I said in the cutting off of my
days, I @ go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the
residue of my @8.

38:11 I said, I @ not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of
the living: I @ @% man no more with the inhabitants of the
world.

38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with
pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

38:13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

38:14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed;
@[take for me.

38:15 What @ I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and @9 hath
done it: I @ go softly all my @8 in the bitterness of my soul.

38:16 O LORD, by @ @ men live, and in all @ @ is the
life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.

38:17 @., for @U I had @ bitterness: but thou hast in love
to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast
all my sins behind thy back.

38:18 For the grave cannot praise thee, @^ can not celebrate thee:
they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

38:19 The living, the living, he @ praise thee, as I do this day:
the @ to the @ @ make known thy truth.

38:20 The LORD was ready to save me: @fore we will sing my songs
to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the @ of
the LORD.

38:21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
for a plaister upon the boil, and he @ recover.

38:22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I @ go up to
the @ of the LORD?  39:1 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of
Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for
he had @) that he had been sick, and was recovered.

39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the @ of his
precious @, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and all the @ of his armour, and all that was
@V in his treasures: @ was no@7 in his @, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

39:3 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
him, What said @ men? and from whence came they unto thee? And
Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from
Babylon.

39:4 Then said he, What have they seen in @ @? And Hezekiah
@>, All that is in mine @ have they seen: @ is no@7
@ my treasures that I have not shewed them.

39:5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
39:6 @., the days come, that all that is in @ @, and that
@ thy @s have laid up in store until this day, @ be
carried to Babylon: no@7 @ be left, @
 the LORD.

39:7 And of thy sons that @ issue from thee, @ thou @
beget, @ they take away; and they @ be eunuchs in the palace
of the king of Babylon.

39:8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD @
thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For @ @ be @U and truth
in my days.

40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my @, @
 your God.

40:2 Speak ye comfortably to @ , and cry unto her, that her
warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath
received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

40:3 The @; of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

40:4 Every valley @ be exalted, and @ mountain and hill @
be made low: and the crooked @ be made straight, and the rough
@'s plain: 40:5 And the @Y of the LORD @ be revealed, and
all @R @ see it @?: for the @P of the LORD hath spoken
it.

40:6 The @; said, Cry. And he said, What @ I cry? All @R is
grass, and all the goodliness @of is as the flower of the field:
40:7 The grass wi@th, the flower fadeth: @ the spirit of the
LORD bloweth upon it: surely the @ is grass.

40:8 The grass wi@th, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God
@ stand for ever.

40:9 O Zion, that @(est good tidings, get thee up into the high
mountain; O @ , that @(est good tidings, lift up thy @;
with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the @G of
@, @. your God!  40:10 @., the Lord GOD will come with
strong hand, and his arm @ rule for him: @%, his reward is
with him, and his work @	 him.

40:11 He @ feed his flock like a shepherd: he @ gather the
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and @ gently lead
@J that are with young.

40:12 Who hath measured the @Zs in the hollow of his hand, and
meted out @1 with the span, and comprehended the dust of the @
in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
balance?  40:13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
counsellor hath taught him?  40:14 With whom took he counsel, and who
instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him
knowledge, and shewed to him the way of @[standing?  40:15 @.,
the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small
dust of the balance: @%, he taketh up the isles as a very little
@7.

40:16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts @of
sufficient for a @_ @&.

40:17 All nations @	 him are as no@7; and they are counted to
him less than no@7, and vanity.

40:18 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare
unto him?  40:19 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

40:20 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to
prepare a graven image, that @ not be moved.

40:21 Have ye not known? have ye not @)? hath it not been told you
from the beginning? have ye not @[stood from the @Vations of the
@?  40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the @, and
the inhabitants @of are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
@1s as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
40:23 That @(eth the princes to no@7; he maketh the judges of
the @ as vanity.

40:24 Yea, they @ not be planted; yea, they @ not be sown:
yea, @ stock @ not take root in the @: and he @ also
blow upon them, and they @ wither, and the whirlwind @ take

40:25 To whom then will ye liken me, or @ I be equal? @
 the
Holy One.

40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and @% who hath created @
@, that @(eth out @ host by number: he calleth them all by

not one faileth.

40:27 Why sayest thou, O @], and @Kest, O @, My way is hid
from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?  40:28 Hast
thou not known? hast thou not @), that the everlasting God, the
LORD, the Creator of the ends of the @, fainteth not, @" is
weary? @ is no searching of his @[standing.

40:29 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no @B he
increaseth strength.

40:30 Even the youths @ faint and be weary, and the young men
@ utterly fall: 40:31 But they that wait upon the LORD @ renew
@ strength; they @ mount up with wings as eagles; they @
run, and not be weary; and they @ walk, and not faint.

41:1 Keep silence @	 me, O islands; and let the @ renew @
strength: let them come near; then let them @K: let us come near
@? to judgment.

41:2 Who raised up the @ceous man from the east, @, him to his
foot, gave the nations @	 him, and made him rule over kings? he
gave them as the dust to his @Q, and as driven stubble to his bow.

41:3 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had
not gone with his feet.

41:4 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
beginning? I the LORD, the @O, and with the last; I am he.

41:5 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the @ were afraid,
drew near, and came.

41:6 They helped @ one his neighbour; and @ one said to his
@X, Be of good courage.

41:7 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth
with the hammer him that smote the anvil, @, It is ready for the
sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it @# not be moved.

41:8 But thou, @, art my @<, @] whom I have chosen, the

41:9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the @, and @,
thee from the chief men @of, and said unto thee, Thou art my

41:10 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold
thee with the @c hand of my @ceousness.

41:11 @., all they that were incensed @

ashamed and con@Ved: they @ be as no@7; and they that strive

41:12 Thou @ seek them, and @ not find them, even them that

41:13 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy @c hand, @ unto

41:14 Fear not, thou worm @], and ye men of @; I will help
thee, @

41:15 @., I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having

41:16 Thou @ fan them, and the wind @ carry them away, and the

41:17 When the poor and needy seek @Z, and @ is none, and @
tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of

41:18 I will open rivers in high @'s, and fountains in the @a of

41:19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and

and know the latter end of them; or declare us @ for to come.

41:23 Shew the @ that are to come here@, that we may know
that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed,
and @% it @?.

41:24 @., ye are of no@7, and your work of nought: an
abomination is he that chooseth you.

41:25 I have raised up one from the north, and he @ come: from the
rising of the sun @ he call upon my name: and he @ come upon
princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.

41:26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
@	time, that we may say, He is @ceous? yea, @ is none that
sheweth, yea, @ is none that declareth, yea, @ is none that
heareth your @5.

41:27 The @O @ say to Zion, @., @% them: and I will
give to @  one that @(eth good tidings.

41:28 For I beheld, and @ was no man; even @ them, and @
was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

41:29 @., they are all vanity; @ works are no@7: @
molten images are wind and confusion.

42:1 @. my @<, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he @ @( @
judgment to the Gentiles.

42:2 He @ not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his @; to be @) in
the street.

42:3 A bruised reed @ he not break, and the smoking flax @ he
not quench: he @ @( @ judgment unto truth.

42:4 He @ not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment
in the @: and the isles @ wait for his law.

42:5 Thus @
 God the LORD, he that created the @1s, and
stretched them out; he that spread @ the @, and that @
cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the @ upon it, and
spirit to them that walk @in: 42:6 I the LORD have @, thee in
@ceousness, and will hold @ hand, and will keep thee, and give
thee for a covenant of the @, for a light of the Gentiles; 42:7
To open the blind eyes, to @( out the prisoners from the prison,
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison @.

42:8 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my @Y will I not give to
@F, @" my praise to graven images.

42:9 @., the former @ are come to pass, and new @ do I
declare: @	 they spring @ I tell you of them.

42:10 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
the @, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is @in; the
isles, and the inhabitants @of.

42:11 Let the wilderness and the @G @of lift up @ @;,
the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock
sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

42:12 Let them give @Y unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the
islands.

42:13 The LORD @ go @ as a @By man, he @ stir up
jealousy like a man of war: he @ cry, yea, roar; he @ prevail
@
 his enemies.

42:14 I have long time holden my @U; I have been still, and
refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will
destroy and devour at once.

42:15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all @
herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the
pools.

42:16 And I will @( the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness
light @	 them, and crooked @ straight. These @ will I do
unto them, and not forsake them.

42:17 They @ be turned back, they @ be @ly ashamed, that
trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our
gods.

42:18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

42:19 Who is blind, but my @<? or deaf, as my messenger that I
sent?  who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's
@<?  42:20 Seeing many @, but thou observest not; opening
the ears, but he heareth not.

42:21 The LORD is well pleased for his @ceousness' sake; he will
magnify the law, and make it honourable.

42:22 But this is a @ robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
snared in holes, and they are hid in prison @s: they are for a
prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none @
, Restore.

42:23 Who @ you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
for the time to come?  42:24 Who gave @] for a spoil, and @ to
the robbers? did not the LORD, he @
 whom we have sinned? for
they @L not walk in his ways, @" were they obedient unto his
law.

42:25 @N he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the
strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round @+, yet he
knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to @.

43:1 But now thus @
 the LORD that created thee, O @], and he
that formed thee, O @, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have
@, thee by thy name; thou art mine.

43:2 When thou passest @E the @Zs, I will be with thee; and
@E the rivers, they @ not overflow thee: when thou walkest
@E the fire, thou @ not be burned; @" @ the flame

43:3 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of @, thy Saviour: I
gave @- for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

43:4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
and I have loved thee: @fore will I give men for thee, and @
for thy life.

43:5 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will @( thy seed from the
east, and gather thee from the west; 43:6 I will say to the north,
Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: @( my sons from far, and
my daughters from the ends of the @; 43:7 Even @ one that is
@, by my name: for I have created him for my @Y, I have formed
him; yea, I have made him.

43:8 Bring @ the blind @ that have eyes, and the deaf that
have ears.

43:9 Let all the nations be ga@d @?, and let the @ be
assembled: who @ them can declare this, and shew us former @?
let them @( @ @ witnesses, that they may be justified: or
let them hear, and say, It is truth.

43:10 Ye are my witnesses, @
 the LORD, and my @< whom I have
chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and @[stand that I am he:
@	 me @ was no God formed, @" @ @ be @ me.

43:11 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me @ is no saviour.

43:12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when @
was no strange god @ you: @fore ye are my witnesses, @
 the
LORD, that I am God.

43:13 Yea, @	 the day was I am he; and @ is none that can
deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who @ let it?  43:14 Thus
@
 the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of @; For your sake I
have sent to Babylon, and have @ down all @ nobles, and the
Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of @, your King.

43:16 Thus @
 the LORD, @ maketh a way in the sea, and a path
in the @By @Zs; 43:17 Which @(eth @ the chariot and
horse, the army and the power; they @ lie down @?, they

43:18 Remember ye not the former @, @" consider the @
of old.

43:19 @., I will do a new @7; now it @ spring @; @
ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers

43:20 The beast of the field @ honour me, the dragons and the
owls: @ I give @Zs in the wilderness, and rivers in the
desert, to give @b to my @, my chosen.

43:21 This @ have I formed for myself; they @ shew @ my

43:22 But thou hast not @, upon me, O @]; but thou hast been
weary of me, O @.

43:23 Thou hast not @ me the small cattle of thy @_

not caused thee to serve with an @&, nor wearied thee with
incense.

43:24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, @" hast thou
filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to
serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with @ iniquities.

43:25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

43:26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead @?: declare thou, that
thou mayest be justified.

43:27 Thy @O @ hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed
@
 me.

43:28 @N I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have
@= @] to the curse, and @ to reproaches.

44:1 Yet now hear, O @] my @<; and @, whom I have chosen:
44:2 Thus @
 the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
womb, @ will help thee; Fear not, O @], my @<; and thou,
Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

44:3 For I will pour @Z upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon
the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing
upon @ offspring: 44:4 And they @ spring up as @ the
grass, as willows by the @Z courses.

44:5 One @ say, I am the LORD's; and @F @ call @9 by
the name of @]; and @F @ subscribe with his hand unto the
LORD, and surname @9 by the name of @.

44:6 Thus @
 the LORD the King of @, and his redeemer the LORD
of hosts; I am the @O, and I am the last; and beside me @ is no
God.

44:7 And who, as I, @ call, and @ declare it, and set it in
order for me, since I appointed the ancient @? and the @
that are coming, and @ come, let them shew unto them.

44:8 Fear ye not, @" be afraid: have not I told thee from that
time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is @ a God
beside me? yea, @ is no God; I know not any.

44:9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and @
delectable @ @ not profit; and they are @ own witnesses;
they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

44:10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
profitable for no@7?  44:11 @., all his fellows @ be
ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be ga@d
@?, let them stand up; yet they @ fear, and they @ be
ashamed @?.

44:12 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his
arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he @beth no
@Z, and is faint.

44:13 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a
line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the
compass, and maketh it @ the figure of a man, @$ to the
beauty of a man; that it may remain in the @.

44:14 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
@ he strengtheneth for @9 @ the trees of the forest: he
planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

44:15 Then @ it be for a man to burn: for he will take @of,
and warm @9; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh @d; yea, he
maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and
falleth down @to.

44:16 He burneth part @of in the fire; with part @of he eateth
@R; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth @9,
and @
, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 44:17 And the residue
@of he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto
it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and @
, Deliver me;
for thou art my god.

44:18 They have not known nor @[stood: for he hath shut @ eyes,
that they cannot see; and @ @s, that they cannot @[stand.

44:19 And none considereth in his @, @" is @ knowledge
nor @[standing to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea,
also I have baked @d upon the coals @of; I have roasted @R,
and eaten it: and @ I make the residue @of an abomination?
@ I fall down to the stock of a tree?  44:20 He feedeth on ashes:
a deceived @ hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his
soul, nor say, Is @ not a lie in my @c hand?  44:21 Remember
@, O @] and @; for thou art my @<: I have formed
thee; thou art my @<: O @, thou @ not be forgotten of
me.

44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

44:23 Sing, O ye @1s; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
parts of the @: break @ into singing, ye mountains, O forest,
and @ tree @in: for the LORD hath redeemed @], and
glorified @9 in @.

44:24 Thus @
 the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from
the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all @; that stretcheth @
the @1s alone; that spreadeth abroad the @ by myself; 44:25
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad;
that turneth wise men backward, and maketh @ knowledge foolish;
44:26 That confirmeth the word of his @<, and performeth the
counsel of his messengers; that @
 to @ , Thou @ be
inhabited; and to the @G of @, Ye @ be built, and I will
raise up the decayed @'s @of: 44:27 That @
 to the deep, Be
dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 44:28 That @
 of Cyrus, He is my
shepherd, and @ perform all my pleasure: even @ to @ ,
Thou @ be built; and to the temple, Thy @Vation @ be laid.

45:1 Thus @
 the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose @c hand I
have holden, to subdue nations @	 him; and I will loose the loins
of kings, to open @	 him the two leaved gates; and the gates @
not be shut; 45:2 I will go @	 thee, and make the crooked @'s
straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in s@[
the bars of iron: 45:3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,
and hidden riches of secret @'s, that thou mayest know that I, the
LORD, @ call thee by thy name, am the God of @.

45:4 For @] my @<'s sake, and @ mine elect, I have even
@, thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not
known me.

45:5 I am the LORD, and @ is none else, @ is no God beside me:
I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 45:6 That they may know
from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that @ is none
beside me. I am the LORD, and @ is none else.

45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make @U, and create
evil: I the LORD do all @ @.

45:8 Drop down, ye @1s, from above, and let the skies pour down
@ceousness: let the @ open, and let them @( @ salvation,
and let @ceousness spring up @?; I the LORD have created it.

45:9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
strive with the potsherds of the @. Shall the clay say to him that
fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no @D?  45:10
Woe unto him that @
 unto his @, What begettest thou? or to
the woman, What hast thou @ @?  45:11 Thus @
 the LORD,
the Holy One of @, and his Maker, Ask me of @ to come
concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my @D command ye me.

45:12 I have made the @, and created man upon it: I, even my
@D, have stretched out the @1s, and all @ host have I
@M.

45:13 I have raised him up in @ceousness, and I will direct all his
ways: he @ build my city, and he @ let go my captives, not for
price nor reward, @
 the LORD of hosts.

45:14 Thus @
 the LORD, The labour of @-, and merchandise of
Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, @ come over unto
thee, and they @ be @: they @ come @ thee; in chains
they @ come over, and they @ fall down unto thee, they @
make supplication unto thee, @, Surely God is in thee; and @
is none else, @ is no God.

45:15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of @, the
Saviour.

45:16 They @ be ashamed, and also con@Ved, all of them: they
@ go to confusion @? that are makers of idols.

45:17 But @ @ be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
salvation: ye @ not be ashamed nor con@Ved world @S end.

45:18 For thus @
 the LORD that created the @1s; God @9
that formed the @ and made it; he hath established it, he created
it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and @
is none else.

45:19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark @' of the @: I
said not unto the seed of @], Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD @K
@ceousness, I declare @ that are @c.

45:20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near @?, ye that are
escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of
@ graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.

45:21 Tell ye, and @( them near; yea, let them take counsel
@?: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it
from that time?  have not I the LORD? and @ is no God else beside
me; a just God and a Saviour; @ is none beside me.

45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the @: for I
am God, and @ is none else.

45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my @P in
@ceousness, and @ not return, That unto me @ knee @
bow, @ tongue @ swear.

45:24 Surely, @ one say, in the LORD have I @ceousness and
strength: even to him @ men come; and all that are incensed
@
 him @ be ashamed.

45:25 In the LORD @ all the seed of @ be justified, and @
@Y.

46:1 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, @ idols were upon the beasts,
and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a
burden to the weary beast.

46:2 They stoop, they bow down @?; they could not deliver the
burden, but @T are gone into captivity.

46:3 Hearken unto me, O @ of @], and all the remnant of the
@ of @, @ are borne by me from the belly, @ are
carried from the womb: 46:4 And even to your old age I am he; and even
to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I
will carry, and will deliver you.

46:5 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that
we may be like?  46:6 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh
silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god:
they fall down, yea, they worship.

46:7 They bear him upon the @#er, they carry him, and set him in
his @', and he standeth; from his @' @ he not remove: yea,
one @ cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his

46:8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: @( it @* to mind, O
ye transgressors.

46:9 Remember the former @ of old: for I am God, and @ is
none else; I am God, and @ is none like me, 46:10 Declaring the
end from the beginning, and from ancient times the @ that are not
yet done, @, My counsel @ stand, and I will do all my

executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will

46:12 Hearken unto me, ye stout@ed, that are far from

47:1 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit

thou @ no more be @, tender and delicate.

47:2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare

47:3 Thy nakedness @ be uncovered, yea, thy shame @ be seen: I

47:4 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One

47:5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
Chaldeans: for thou @ no more be @,, The lady of kingdoms.

47:6 I was wroth with my @, I have polluted mine inheritance, and
@= them into @ hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the

47:7 And thou saidst, I @ be a lady for ever: so that thou didst

end of it.

47:8 @N hear now this, thou that art @= to pleasures, that
dwellest carelessly, that sayest in @ @, I am, and none else

in one day, the loss of @, and widowhood: they @ come upon
thee in @ perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for
the @ abundance of @ enchantments.

47:10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and
thou hast said in @ @, I am, and none else beside me.

47:11 @N @ evil come upon thee; thou @ not know from
whence it riseth: and mischief @ fall upon thee; thou @ not be
able to put it off: and desolation @ come upon thee suddenly,
@ thou @ not know.

47:12 Stand now with @ enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou
@ be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

47:13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up,
and save thee from @ @ that @ come upon thee.

47:14 @., they @ be as stubble; the fire @ burn them; they
@ not deliver @T from the power of the flame: @ @

47:15 Thus @ they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even

48:1 Hear ye this, O @ of @], @ are @, by the name of
@, and are come @ out of the @Zs of @, @ swear by

48:2 For they call @T of the holy city, and stay @T

48:3 I have declared the former @ from the beginning; and they
went @ out of my @P, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly,
and they came to pass.

48:4 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron
sinew, and thy brow brass; 48:5 I have even from the beginning
declared it to thee; @	 it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest
thou @#est say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and
my molten image, hath @M them.

48:6 Thou hast @), see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have
shewed thee new @ from this time, even hidden @, and thou

48:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even @	 the

48:8 Yea, thou @)est not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that

very treacherously, and wast @, a transgressor from the womb.

48:9 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

48:10 @., I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen
thee in the furnace of affliction.

48:11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how
@# my name be polluted? and I will not give my @Y unto @F.

48:12 Hearken unto me, O @] and @, my @,; I am he; I am
the @O, I also am the last.

48:13 Mine hand also hath laid the @Vation of the @, and my
@c hand hath spanned the @1s: when I call unto them, they stand
up @?.

48:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; @ @ them hath
declared @ @? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
pleasure on Babylon, and his arm @ be on the Chaldeans.

48:15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have @, him: I have @
him, and he @ make his way prosperous.

48:16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret
from the beginning; from the time that it was, @ am I: and now the
Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

48:17 Thus @
 the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of @; I am
the LORD thy God @ teacheth thee to profit, @ leadeth thee by
the way that thou @#est go.

48:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
@U been as a river, and thy @ceousness as the waves of the sea:
48:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
bowels like the gravel @of; his name @# not have been cut off
nor destroyed from @	 me.

48:20 Go ye @ of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a @;
of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the
@; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his @< @].

48:21 And they thirsted not when he led them @E the deserts: he
caused the @Zs to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock
also, and the @Zs gushed out.

48:22 There is no @U, @
 the LORD, unto the wicked.

49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye @, from far; The
LORD hath @, me from the womb; from the bowels of my m@C hath
he made mention of my name.

49:2 And he hath made my @P like a sharp @Q; in the shadow of
his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver
hath he hid me; 49:3 And said unto me, Thou art my @<, O @,
in whom I will be glorified.

49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and
my work with my God.

49:5 And now, @
 the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
@<, to @( @] @* to him, Though @ be not ga@d,
yet @ I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God @ be
my strength.

49:6 And he said, It is a light @7 that thou @#est be my
@< to raise up the tribes of @], and to restore the preserved
of @: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that
thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the @.

49:7 Thus @
 the LORD, the Redeemer of @, and his Holy One, to
him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a @<
of rulers, Kings @ see and arise, princes also @ worship,
@ of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of @, and
he @ choose thee.

49:8 Thus @
 the LORD, In an acceptable time have I @) thee, and
in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee,
and give thee for a covenant of the @, to establish the @, to
cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 49:9 That thou mayest say to
the prisoners, Go @; to them that are in darkness, Shew
yourselves. They @ feed in the ways, and @ pastures @ be
in all high @'s.

49:10 They @ not hunger nor thirst; @" @ the heat nor sun
smite them: for he that hath mercy on them @ lead them, even by
the springs of @Z @ he guide them.

49:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways @ be
exalted.

49:12 @., @ @ come from far: and, lo, @ from the north
and from the west; and @ from the land of Sinim.

49:13 Sing, O @1s; and be joyful, O @; and break @ into
singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his @, and will
have mercy upon his afflicted.

49:14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
forgotten me.

49:15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she @# not have
compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I
not forget thee.

49:16 @., I have graven thee upon the palms of my @D; thy walls
are continually @	 me.

49:17 Thy @ @ make haste; thy destroyers and they that made
thee waste @ go @ of thee.

49:18 Lift up @ eyes round @+, and @%: all @ gather
@T @?, and come to thee. As I live, @
 the LORD, thou
@ surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind
them on thee, as a bride doeth.

49:19 For thy waste and thy desolate @'s, and the land of thy
destruction, @ even now be too narrow by reason of the
inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up @ be far away.

49:20 The @ @ thou @ have, @ thou hast lost the
@C, @ say @* in @ ears, The @' is too strait for me:
give @' to me that I may dwell.

49:21 Then @ thou say in @ @, Who hath begotten me @,
seeing I have lost my @, and am desolate, a captive, and
removing to and fro? and who hath @ up @? @., I was left
alone; @, where had they been?  49:22 Thus @
 the Lord GOD,
@., I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my
standard to the @: and they @ @( thy sons in @ arms,
and thy daughters @ be carried upon @ @#ers.

49:23 And kings @ be thy nursing @s, and @ queens thy
nursing m@Cs: they @ bow down to thee with @ face toward
the @, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou @ know that
I am the LORD: for they @ not be ashamed that wait for me.

49:24 Shall the prey be taken from the @By, or the lawful captive
delivered?  49:25 But thus @
 the LORD, Even the captives of the
@By @ be taken away, and the prey of the terrible @ be
delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and
I will save thy @.

49:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with @ own @R; and
they @ be drunken with @ own @I, as with sweet wine: and
all @R @ know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,
the @By One of @].

50:1 Thus @
 the LORD, Where is the bill of your m@C's
divorcement, whom I have put away? or @ of my creditors is it to
whom I have sold you?  @., for your iniquities have ye sold
yourselves, and for your transgressions is your m@C put away.

50:2 Wherefore, when I came, was @ no man? when I @,, was
@ none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot
redeem? or have I no power to deliver? @%, at my rebuke I dry up
the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: @ fish stinketh, @
@ is no @Z, and dieth for thirst.

50:3 I clothe the @1s with blackness, and I make sackcloth @
covering.

50:4 The Lord GOD hath @= me the tongue of the learned, that I
@# know how to @K a word in season to him that is weary: he
wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the
learned.

50:5 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
@" turned away back.

50:6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

50:7 For the Lord GOD will help me; @fore @ I not be
con@Ved: @fore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that
I @ not be ashamed.

50:8 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
stand @?: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.

50:9 @., the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that @ condemn
me?  lo, they all @ wax old as a garment; the moth @ eat them
up.

50:10 Who is @ you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the @;
of his @<, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him
trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

50:11 @., all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves @+
with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye
have kindled. This @ ye have of mine hand; ye @ lie down in
sorrow.

51:1 Hearken to me, ye that follow @ @ceousness, ye that seek
the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of
the pit whence ye are digged.

51:2 Look unto Abraham your @, and unto Sarah that bare you: for
I @, him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

51:3 For the LORD @ comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
@'s; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like
the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness @ be @V @in,
thanksgiving, and the @; of melody.

51:4 Hearken unto me, my @; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
for a law @ proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest
for a light of the @.

51:5 My @ceousness is near; my salvation is gone @, and mine
arms @ judge the @; the isles @ wait upon me, and on mine
arm @ they trust.

51:6 Lift up your eyes to the @1s, and look upon the @
beneath: for the @1s @ vanish away like smoke, and the @
@ wax old like a garment, and they that dwell @in @ die in
like manner: but my salvation @ be for ever, and my @ceousness
@ not be abolished.

51:7 Hearken unto me, ye that know @ceousness, the @ in whose
@ is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, @" be ye afraid
of @ revilings.

51:8 For the moth @ eat them up like a garment, and the worm @
eat them like wool: but my @ceousness @ be for ever, and my
salvation from generation to generation.

51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath
cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?  51:10 Art thou not it @ hath
dried the sea, the @Zs of the @ deep; that hath made the depths
of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?  51:11 @N the
redeemed of the LORD @ return, and come with singing unto Zion;
and everlasting joy @ be upon @ head: they @ obtain
gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning @ flee away.

51:12 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
@#est be afraid of a man that @ die, and of the son of man
@ @ be made as grass; 51:13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker,
that hath stretched @ the @1s, and laid the @Vations of the
@; and hast feared continually @ day @ of the fury of
the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury
of the oppressor?  51:14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be
loosed, and that he @# not die in the pit, nor that his @d
@# fail.

51:15 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

51:16 And I have put my @5 in thy @P, and I have covered thee in
the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the @1s, and lay the
@Vations of the @, and say unto Zion, Thou art my @.

51:17 Awake, awake, stand up, O @ , @ hast drunk at the
hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of
the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

51:18 There is none to guide her @ all the sons whom she hath
@ @; @" is @ any that taketh her by the hand of all
the sons that she hath @ up.

51:19 These two @ are come unto thee; who @ be sorry for
thee?  desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the @Q: by
whom @ I comfort thee?  51:20 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at
the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of
the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

51:21 @N hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
with wine: 51:22 Thus @
 thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that
pleadeth the cause of his @, @., I have taken out of @
hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou
@ no more @b it @*: 51:23 But I will put it into the hand of
them that afflict thee; @ have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we
may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the
street, to them that went over.

52:1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
garments, O @ , the holy city: for hence@ @ @ no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

52:2 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O @ :
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

52:3 For thus @
 the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and
ye @ be redeemed @S money.

52:4 For thus @
 the Lord GOD, My @ went down aforetime into
@- to sojourn @; and the Assyrian oppressed them @S cause.

52:5 Now @fore, what have I here, @
 the LORD, that my @
is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl,
@
 the LORD; and my name continually @ day is blasphemed.

52:6 @N my @ @ know my name: @fore they @ know
in that day that I am he that doth @K: @%, it is I.

52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
@(eth good tidings, that publisheth @U; that @(eth good
tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that @
 unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth!  52:8 Thy watchmen @ lift up the @;; with the
@; @? @ they sing: for they @ see eye to eye, when
the LORD @ @( @* Zion.

52:9 Break @ into joy, sing @?, ye waste @'s of

@ .

52:10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations; and all the ends of the @ @ see the salvation of our
God.

52:11 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
@7; go ye out of the @a of her; be ye clean, that bear the
vessels of the LORD.

52:12 For ye @ not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
LORD will go @	 you; and the God of @ will be your rereward.

52:13 @., my @< @ deal prudently, he @ be exalted and
extolled, and be very high.

52:14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 52:15 So @
he sprinkle many nations; the kings @ shut @ @Ps at him:
for that @ had not been told them @ they see; and that @
they had not @) @ they consider.

53:1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
revealed?  53:2 For he @ grow up @	 him as a tender plant, and
as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
when we @ see him, @ is no beauty that we @# desire him.

53:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he
was despised, and we esteemed him not.

53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our @U was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed.

53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned @ one to
his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
@P: he is @ as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep @	
her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his @P.

53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who @ declare
his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for
the transgression of my @ was he stricken.

53:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
@^; @ he had done no violence, @" was any deceit in his
@P.

53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:
when thou @ make his soul an @& for sin, he @ see his
seed, he @ prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD @
prosper in his hand.

53:11 He @ see of the travail of his soul, and @ be satisfied:
by his knowledge @ my @ceous @< justify many; for he @
bear @ iniquities.

53:12 @N will I divide him a portion with the @, and he
@ divide the spoil with the strong; @ he hath poured out his
soul unto @^: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he
bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

54:1 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break @ into
singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for
more are the @ of the desolate than the @ of the married
wife, @
 the LORD.

54:2 Enlarge the @' of thy tent, and let them stretch @ the
curtains of @ habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and
strengthen thy stakes; 54:3 For thou @ break @ on the @c
hand and on the left; and thy seed @ inherit the Gentiles, and
make the desolate @G to be inhabited.

54:4 Fear not; for thou @ not be ashamed: @" be thou
con@Ved; for thou @ not be put to shame: for thou @ forget
the shame of thy youth, and @ not remember the reproach of thy
widowhood any more.

54:5 For thy Maker is @ husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
and thy Redeemer the Holy One of @; The God of the whole @
@ he be @,.

54:6 For the LORD hath @, thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, @
 thy God.

54:7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with @ mercies
will I gather thee.

54:8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, @
 the LORD thy
Redeemer.

54:9 For this is as the @Zs of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
that the @Zs of Noah @# no more go over the @; so have I
sworn that I @L not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

54:10 For the mountains @ depart, and the hills be removed; but my
kindness @ not depart from thee, @" @ the covenant of my
@U be removed, @
 the LORD that hath mercy on thee.

54:11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
@%, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
@Vations with sapphires.

54:12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

54:13 And all thy @ @ be taught of the LORD; and @
@ be the @U of thy @.

54:14 In @ceousness @ thou be established: thou @ be far
from oppression; for thou @ not fear: and from terror; for it
@ not come near thee.

54:15 @., they @ surely gather @?, but not by me:
whosoever @ gather @? @
 thee @ fall for thy sake.

54:16 @., I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
fire, and that @(eth @ an instrument for his work; and I have
created the waster to destroy.

54:17 No weapon that is formed @

tongue that @ rise @

This is the heritage of the @<s of the LORD, and @
@ceousness is of me, @
 the LORD.

55:1 Ho, @ one that thirsteth, come ye to the @Zs, and he that
hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk
@S money and @S price.

55:2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that @ is not @d? and your
labour for that @ satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and
eat ye that @ is good, and let your soul delight itself in
fatness.

55:3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul @
live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure
mercies of @.

55:4 @., I have @= him for a witness to the @, a leader
and commander to the @.

55:5 @., thou @ call a nation that thou knowest not, and
nations that knew not thee @ run unto thee @ of the LORD thy
God, and for the Holy One of @; for he hath glorified thee.

55:6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be @V, call ye upon him while he
is near: 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the un@ceous man
his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy
upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, @" are your ways my
ways, @
 the LORD.

55:9 For as the @1s are higher than the @, so are my ways
higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from @1, and
returneth not thither, but @Zeth the @, and maketh it @(
@ and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and @d to the
eater: 55:11 So @ my word be that goeth @ out of my @P: it
@ not return unto me void, but it @ accomplish that @ I
please, and it @ prosper in the @7 whereto I sent it.

55:12 For ye @ go out with joy, and be led @ with @U: the
mountains and the hills @ break @ @	 you into singing, and
all the trees of the field @ clap @ @D.

55:13 Instead of the thorn @ come up the fir tree, and instead of
the brier @ come up the myrtle tree: and it @ be to the LORD
for a name, for an everlasting sign that @ not be cut off.

56:1 Thus @
 the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
salvation is near to come, and my @ceousness to be revealed.

56:2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and
keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

56:3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined @9 to
the LORD, @K, @, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his

56:4 For thus @

and choose the @ that please me, and take hold of my covenant;
56:5 Even unto them will I give in mine @ and within my walls a

them an everlasting name, that @ not be cut off.

56:6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join @T to the LORD,
to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his @<s,
@ one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold

56:8 The Lord GOD, @ ga@th the outcasts of @ @

56:9 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in
the forest.

56:10 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb
dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.

56:11 Yea, they are greedy dogs @ can never have enough, and they
are shepherds that cannot @[stand: they all look to @ own way,
@ one for his gain, from his quarter.

56:12 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves
with strong @b; and to morrow @ be as this day, and much more

57:1 The @ceous perisheth, and no man layeth it to @: and

57:2 He @ enter into @U: they @ rest in @ beds, each

57:3 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the

57:4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? @

57:5 Enflaming yourselves with idols @[ @ green tree, slaying

a meat @&. Should I receive comfort in @?  57:7 Upon a lofty
and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up
to offer sacrifice.

57:8 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to @F than me, and
art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with
them; thou lovedst @ bed where thou sawest it.

57:9 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase
thyself even unto hell.

57:10 Thou art wearied in the @ness of thy way; yet saidst thou
not, There is no hope: thou hast @V the life of @ hand;
@fore thou wast not grieved.

57:11 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy @? have not I
held my @U even of old, and thou fearest me not?  57:12 I will
declare thy @ceousness, and thy works; for they @ not profit
thee.

57:13 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
@ carry them all away; vanity @ take them: but he that putteth
his trust in me @ possess the land, and @ inherit my holy
mountain; 57:14 And @ say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the
way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my @.

57:15 For thus @
 the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy @', with him also
that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the
humble, and to revive the @ of the contrite ones.

57:16 For I will not contend for ever, @" will I be always wroth:
for the spirit @# fail @	 me, and the souls @ I have made.

57:17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him:
I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his
@.

57:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

57:19 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, @U to him that is far
off, and to him that is near, @
 the LORD; and I will heal him.

57:20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
whose @Zs cast up mire and dirt.

57:21 There is no @U, @
 my God, to the wicked.

58:1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy @; like a trumpet, and shew
my @ @ transgression, and the @ of @] @ sins.

58:2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation
that did @ceousness, and forsook not the ordinance of @ God:
they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in
approaching to God.

58:3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore
have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? @., in
the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.

58:4 @., ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist
of wickedness: ye @ not fast as ye do this day, to make your @;
to be @) on high.

58:5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict
his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread
sackcloth and ashes @[ him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an
acceptable day to the LORD?  58:6 Is not this the fast that I have
chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break @ yoke?  58:7
Is it not to deal thy @d to the hungry, and that thou @( the
poor that are cast out to thy @? when thou seest the naked, that
thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from @ own @R?
58:8 Then @ thy light break @ as the morning, and @ health
@ spring @ speedily: and thy @ceousness @ go @	
thee; the @Y of the LORD @ be thy rereward.

58:9 Then @ thou call, and the LORD @ answer; thou @ cry,
and he @ say, Here I am. If thou take away from the @a of thee
the yoke, the putting @ of the finger, and @King vanity; 58:10
And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted
soul; then @ thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as
the noon day: 58:11 And the LORD @ guide thee continually, and
satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou @ be
like a @Zed garden, and like a spring of @Z, whose @Zs fail
not.

58:12 And they that @ be of thee @ build the old waste @'s:
thou @ raise up the @Vations of many generations; and thou
@ be @,, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to
dwell in.

58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
the LORD, honourable; and @ honour him, not doing @ own ways,
nor finding @ own pleasure, nor @King @ own @5: 58:14
Then @ thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to
ride upon the high @'s of the @, and feed thee with the
heritage of @] thy @: for the @P of the LORD hath spoken
it.

59:1 @., the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
@" his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 59:2 But your iniquities
have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his
face from you, that he will not hear.

59:3 For your @D are defiled with @I, and your fingers with
iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered
perverseness.

59:4 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust
in vanity, and @K lies; they conceive mischief, and @( @
iniquity.

59:5 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that
eateth of @ eggs dieth, and that @ is crushed breaketh out
into a viper.

59:6 Their webs @ not become garments, @" @ they cover
@T with @ works: @ works are works of iniquity, and
the act of violence is in @ @D.

59:7 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
@I: @ thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
destruction are in @ paths.

59:8 The way of @U they know not; and @ is no judgment in @
goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth @in
@ not know @U.

59:9 @N is judgment far from us, @" doth justice overtake
us: we wait for light, but @% obscurity; for b@cness, but we
walk in darkness.

59:10 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had
no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate
@'s as dead men.

59:11 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
judgment, but @ is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied @	 thee, and our sins
testify @
 us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our
iniquities, we know them; 59:13 In transgressing and lying @
 the
LORD, and departing away from our God, @King oppression and revolt,
conceiving and uttering from the @ @5 of falsehood.

59:14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar
off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

59:15 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
@9 a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that @
was no judgment.

59:16 And he saw that @ was no man, and wondered that @ was no
intercessor: @fore his arm @ salvation unto him; and his
@ceousness, it sustained him.

59:17 For he put on @ceousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for
clo@7, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

59:18 According to @ deeds, @$ly he will repay, fury to his
adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay
recompence.

59:19 So @ they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
@Y from the rising of the sun. When the enemy @ come in like a
flood, the Spirit of the LORD @ lift up a standard @
 him.

59:20 And the Redeemer @ come to Zion, and unto them that turn
from transgression in @], @
 the LORD.

59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, @
 the LORD; My
spirit that is upon thee, and my @5 @ I have put in thy @P,
@ not depart out of thy @P, nor out of the @P of thy seed,
nor out of the @P of thy seed's seed, @
 the LORD, from
hence@ and for ever.

60:1 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the @Y of the LORD is
risen upon thee.

60:2 For, @%, the darkness @ cover the @, and gross
darkness the @: but the LORD @ arise upon thee, and his @Y
@ be seen upon thee.

60:3 And the Gentiles @ come to thy light, and kings to the
b@cness of thy rising.

60:4 Lift up @ eyes round @+, and see: all they gather
@T @?, they come to thee: thy sons @ come from far,
and thy daughters @ be nursed at thy side.

60:5 Then thou @ see, and flow @?, and @ @ @
fear, and be enlarged; @ the abundance of the sea @ be
converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles @ come unto thee.

60:6 The multitude of camels @ cover thee, the dromedaries of
Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba @ come: they @ @(
gold and incense; and they @ shew @ the praises of the LORD.

60:7 All the flocks of Kedar @ be ga@d @? unto thee, the
rams of Nebaioth @ minister unto thee: they @ come up with
acceptance on mine @\, and I will glorify the @ of my @Y.

60:8 Who are @ that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to @
windows?  60:9 Surely the isles @ wait for me, and the ships of
Tarshish @O, to @( thy sons from far, @ silver and @
gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One
of @, @ he hath glorified thee.

60:10 And the sons of strangers @ build up thy walls, and @
kings @ minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in
my favour have I had mercy on thee.

60:11 @N thy gates @ be open continually; they @ not be
shut day nor night; that men may @( unto thee the forces of the
Gentiles, and that @ kings may be @.

60:12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee @
perish; yea, @J nations @ be utterly wasted.

60:13 The @Y of Lebanon @ come unto thee, the fir tree, the
pine tree, and the box @?, to beautify the @' of my
sanctuary; and I will make the @' of my feet glorious.

60:14 The sons also of them that afflicted thee @ come bending
unto thee; and all they that despised thee @ bow @T down
at the soles of thy feet; and they @ call thee; The city of the
LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of @.

60:15 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
@E thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many
generations.

60:16 Thou @ also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and @ suck
the breast of kings: and thou @ know that I the LORD am thy
Saviour and thy Redeemer, the @By One of @].

60:17 For brass I will @( gold, and for iron I will @( silver,
and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers
@U, and @ exactors @ceousness.

60:18 Violence @ no more be @) in thy land, wasting nor
destruction within thy borders; but thou @ call thy walls
Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

60:19 The sun @ be no more thy light by day; @" for
b@cness @ the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD @ be
unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy @Y.

60:20 Thy sun @ no more go down; @" @ thy moon withdraw

thy mourning @ be ended.

60:21 Thy @ also @ be all @ceous: they @ inherit the

may be glorified.

60:22 A little one @ become a @:, and a small one a strong
nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; @ the LORD hath
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to
bind up the broken@ed, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 61:2 To proclaim the
acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to
comfort all that mourn; 61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they @B be
@, trees of @ceousness, the planting of the LORD, that he @B
be glorified.

61:4 And they @ build the old wastes, they @ raise up the
former desolations, and they @ repair the waste @G, the
desolations of many generations.

61:5 And strangers @ stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of
the alien @ be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

61:6 But ye @ be named the Priests of the LORD: men @ call you
the Ministers of our God: ye @ eat the riches of the Gentiles, and
in @ @Y @ ye boast yourselves.

61:7 For your shame ye @ have double; and for confusion they @
rejoice in @ portion: @fore in @ land they @ possess
the double: everlasting joy @ be unto them.

61:8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for @_ @&;
and I will direct @ work in truth, and I will make an everlasting
covenant with them.

61:9 And @ seed @ be known @ the Gentiles, and @
offspring @ the @: all that see them @ acknowledge them,
that they are the seed @ the LORD hath blessed.

61:10 I will @ly rejoice in the LORD, my soul @ be joyful in
my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath
covered me with the robe of @ceousness, as a bridegroom decketh
@9 with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her
jewels.

61:11 For as the @ @(eth @ her bud, and as the garden
causeth the @ that are sown in it to spring @; so the Lord
GOD will cause @ceousness and praise to spring @ @	 all the
nations.

62:1 For Zion's sake will I not hold my @U, and for @ 's
sake I will not rest, until the @ceousness @of go @ as
b@cness, and the salvation @of as a lamp that burneth.

62:2 And the Gentiles @ see thy @ceousness, and all kings thy
@Y: and thou @ be @, by a new name, @ the @P of the
LORD @ name.

62:3 Thou @ also be a crown of @Y in the hand of the LORD, and
a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

62:4 Thou @ no more be termed Forsaken; @" @ thy land any
more be termed Desolate: but thou @ be @, Hephzibah, and thy
land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land @ be

62:5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so @ thy sons marry
thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so @ thy God
rejoice over thee.

62:6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O @ , @ @
never hold @ @U day nor night: ye that make mention of the
LORD, keep not silence, 62:7 And give him no rest, till he establish,
and till he make @  a praise in the @.

62:8 The LORD hath sworn by his @c hand, and by the arm of his
strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for @
enemies; and the sons of the stranger @ not @b thy wine, for
the @ thou hast laboured: 62:9 But they that have ga@d it
@ eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have @ it
@? @ @b it in the courts of my holiness.

62:10 Go @E, go @E the gates; prepare ye the way of the
@; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a
standard for the @.

62:11 @., the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say
ye to the daughter of Zion, @., thy salvation cometh; @%, his
reward is with him, and his work @	 him.

62:12 And they @ call them, The holy @, The redeemed of the
LORD: and thou @ be @,, Sought out, A city not forsaken.

63:1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah?  this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
@ness of his strength? I that @K in @ceousness, @By to
save.

63:2 Wherefore art thou red in @ apparel, and thy garments like
him that treadeth in the winefat?  63:3 I have trodden the winepress
alone; and of the @ @ was none with me: for I will tread them
in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and @ @I @ be
sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

63:4 For the day of vengeance is in mine @, and the year of my
redeemed is come.

63:5 And I looked, and @ was none to help; and I wondered that
@ was none to uphold: @fore mine own arm @ salvation

63:6 And I will tread down the @ in mine anger, and make them
drunk in my fury, and I will @( down @ strength to the @.

63:7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
of the LORD, @$ to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and
the @ goodness toward the @ of @, @ he hath bestowed
on them @$ to his mercies, and @$ to the multitude of
his lovingkindnesses.

63:8 For he said, Surely they are my @, @ that will not
lie: so he was @ Saviour.

63:9 In all @ affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and
he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

63:10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: @fore he was
turned to be @ enemy, and he fought @
 them.

63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, @, and his @,
@, Where is he that @ them up out of the sea with the
shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within
him?  63:12 That led them by the @c hand of @ with his glorious
arm, dividing the @Z @	 them, to make @9 an everlasting
name?  63:13 That led them @E the deep, as an horse in the
wilderness, that they @# not stumble?  63:14 As a beast goeth down

thou lead thy @, to make thyself a glorious name.

63:15 Look down from @1, and @% from the habitation of thy
holiness and of thy @Y: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the
sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they
restrained?  63:16 Doubtless thou art our @, though Abraham be
ignorant of us, and @ acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our
@, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

63:17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
our @ from thy fear? Return for thy @<s' sake, the tribes of
@ inheritance.

63:18 The @ of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:
our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

63:19 We are @: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
@, by thy name.

64:1 Oh that thou @Lest rend the @1s, that thou @Lest come
down, that the mountains @B flow down at thy presence, 64:2 As when
the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the @Zs to boil, to make
thy name known to @ adversaries, that the nations may tremble at
thy presence!  64:3 When thou didst terrible @ @ we looked
not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

64:4 For since the beginning of the world men have not @), nor
perceived by the ear, @" hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,
what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

64:5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh @ceousness, @J
that remember thee in thy ways: @%, thou art wroth; for we have
sinned: in @J is continuance, and we @ be saved.

64:6 But we are all as an unclean @7, and all our @ceousnesses
are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities,
like the wind, have taken us away.

64:7 And @ is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
@9 to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and
hast consumed us, @ of our iniquities.

64:8 But now, O LORD, thou art our @; we are the clay, and thou
our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

64:9 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, @" remember iniquity for

64:10 Thy holy @G are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
@  a desolation.

64:11 Our holy and our beautiful @, where our @s praised
thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant @ are laid
waste.

64:12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for @ @, O LORD? wilt thou
hold thy @U, and afflict us very sore?  65:1 I am sought of them
that asked not for me; I am @V of them that sought me not: I said,

65:2 I have spread out my @D all the day unto a rebellious @,
@ walketh in a way that was not good, @ @ own thoughts;
65:3 A @ that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that

Which remain @ the graves, and lodge in the monuments, @ eat
swine's @R, and broth of abominable @ is in @ vessels;
65:5 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier
than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the
day.

65:6 @., it is written @	 me: I will not keep silence, but
will recompense, even recompense into @ bosom, 65:7 Your
iniquities, and the iniquities of your @s @?, @
 the
LORD, @ have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me
upon the hills: @fore will I measure @ former work into @
bosom.

65:8 Thus @
 the LORD, As the new wine is @V in the cluster, and
one @
, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for
my @<s' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

65:9 And I will @( @ a seed out of @], and out of @ an

65:10 And Sharon @ be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a

65:11 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the

65:12 @N will I number you to the @Q, and ye @ all bow
down to the slaughter: @ when I @,, ye did not answer; when

65:13 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD, @., my @<s @

65:15 And ye @ leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the

That he who blesseth @9 in the @ @ bless @9 in the

65:17 For, @%, I create new @1s and a new @: and the

65:18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that @ I create: for,

65:19 And I will rejoice in @ , and joy in my @: and the

65:20 There @ be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man

65:21 And they @ build @s, and inhabit them; and they @
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

65:22 They @ not build, and @F inhabit; they @ not plant,

65:23 They @ not labour in vain, nor @( @ for trouble; for

65:24 And it @ come to pass, that @	 they call, I will answer;
and while they are yet @King, I will hear.

65:25 The wolf and the lamb @ feed @?, and the lion @

@ not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, @

66:1 Thus @
 the LORD, The @1 is my throne, and the @ is my
footstool: where is the @ that ye build unto me? and where is the
@' of my rest?  66:2 For all @J @ hath mine hand made, and
all @J @ have been, @
 the LORD: but to this man will I
look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth
at my word.

66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth
a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation,
as if he offered swine's @I; he that burneth incense, as if he
blessed an idol.

Yea, they have chosen @ own ways, and @ soul delighteth in
@ abominations.

66:4 I also will choose @ delusions, and will @( @ fears
upon them; @ when I @,, none did answer; when I @0, they
did not hear: but they did evil @	 mine eyes, and chose that in
@ I delighted not.

66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
@3 that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said,
Let the LORD be glorified: but he @ appear to your joy, and they
@ be ashamed.

66:6 A @; of noise from the city, a @; from the temple, a @;

66:7 Before she travailed, she @ @; @	 her pain came,

66:8 Who hath @) such a @7? who hath seen such @? Shall the

66:9 Shall I @( to the birth, and not cause to @( @? @

the LORD: @ I cause to @( @, and shut the womb? @

66:10 Rejoice ye with @ , and be glad with her, all ye that
love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 66:11
That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the
abundance of her @Y.

66:12 For thus @
 the LORD, @., I will extend @U to her like
a river, and the @Y of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then
@ ye suck, ye @ be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon

66:13 As one whom his m@C comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye

66:14 And when ye see this, your @ @ rejoice, and your bones

66:15 For, @%, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots

flames of fire.

66:16 For by fire and by his @Q will the LORD plead with all @R:
and the slain of the LORD @ be many.

66:17 They that sanctify @T, and purify @T in the

 the

66:18 For I know @ works and @ thoughts: it @ come, that I

66:19 And I will set a sign @ them, and I will send @J that

66:20 And they @ @( all your @3 for an @& unto the

66:23 And it @ come to pass, that from one new moon to @F,

66:24 And they @ go @, and look upon the carcases of the men

The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah


1:1 The @5 of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the @6s that
were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 1:2 To whom the word of the
LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of @, in the
thirteenth year of his reign.

1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
@, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah
king of @, unto the carrying away of @  captive in the
fifth month.

1:4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 1:5 Before I
formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and @	 thou camest @ out
of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the
nations.

1:6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! @%, I cannot @K: for I am a
child.

1:7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou @
go to all that I @ send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou
@ @K.

1:8 Be not afraid of @ faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
@
 the LORD.

1:9 Then the LORD put @ his hand, and touched my @P. And the
LORD said unto me, @., I have put my @5 in thy @P.

1:10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
down, to build, and to plant.

1:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, Jeremiah,
what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

1:12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
hasten my word to perform it.

1:13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, @,
What seest thou? And I said, I see a see@7 pot; and the face
@of is toward the north.

1:14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil @ break
@ upon all the inhabitants of the land.

1:15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
north, @
 the LORD; and they @ come, and they @ set @
one his throne at the entering of the gates of @ , and @

all the walls @of round @+, and @
 all the @G of
@.

1:16 And I will utter my judgments @
 them touching all @
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto @C
gods, and worshipped the works of @ own @D.

1:17 Thou @fore gird up thy loins, and arise, and @K unto them
all that I command thee: be not dismayed at @ faces, lest I
con@V thee @	 them.

1:18 For, @%, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
iron pillar, and brasen walls @
 the whole land, @
 the
kings of @, @
 the princes @of, @
 the @6s
@of, and @
 the @ of the land.

1:19 And they @ fight @
 thee; but they @ not prevail
@
 thee; for I am with thee, @
 the LORD, to deliver thee.

2:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, @, 2:2 Go and cry
in the ears of @ , @, Thus @
 the LORD; I remember
thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of @ espousals, when
thou wentest @ me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

2:3 @ was holiness unto the LORD, and the @Ofruits of his
increase: all that devour him @ offend; evil @ come upon them,
@
 the LORD.

2:4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O @ of @], and all the
families of the @ of @: 2:5 Thus @
 the LORD, What
iniquity have your @s @V in me, that they are gone far from
me, and have walked @ vanity, and are become vain?  2:6 Neither
said they, Where is the LORD that @ us up out of the land of
@-, that led us @E the wilderness, @E a land of deserts
and of pits, @E a land of drought, and of the shadow of @^,
@E a land that no man passed @E, and where no man dwelt?
2:7 And I @ you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
@of and the goodness @of; but when ye entered, ye defiled my
land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

2:8 The @6s said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the
law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed @
 me, and the
prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked @ @ that do not
profit.

2:9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, @
 the LORD, and with your
@'s @ will I plead.

2:10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,
and consider diligently, and see if @ be such a @7.

2:11 Hath a nation changed @ gods, @ are yet no gods? but my
@ have changed @ @Y for that @ doth not profit.

2:12 Be astonished, O ye @1s, at this, and be horribly afraid, be
ye very desolate, @
 the LORD.

2:13 For my @ have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
fountain of living @Zs, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no @Z.

2:14 Is @ a @<? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?
2:15 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
land waste: his @G are burned @S inhabitant.

2:16 Also the @ of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
thy head.

2:17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?  2:18 And now
what hast thou to do in the way of @-, to @b the @Zs of
Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to @b the
@Zs of the river?  2:19 Thine own wickedness @ correct thee,
and thy backslidings @ reprove thee: know @fore and see that
it is an evil @7 and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy
God, and that my fear is not in thee, @
 the Lord GOD of hosts.

2:20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and
thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon @ high hill and
@[ @ green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

2:21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a @c seed: how
then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto
me?  2:22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much
soap, yet @ iniquity is marked @	 me, @
 the Lord GOD.

2:23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone @
Baalim?  see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art
a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 2:24 A wild ass used to the
wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion
who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary
@T; in her month they @ find her.

2:25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and
@ them will I go.

2:26 As the thief is ashamed when he is @V, so is the @ of
@ ashamed; they, @ kings, @ princes, and @ @6s,
and @ prophets.

2:27 Saying to a stock, Thou art my @; and to a stone, Thou hast
@ me @: for they have turned @ back unto me, and not
@ face: but in the time of @ trouble they will say, Arise, and
save us.

2:28 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,
if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for @$ to the
number of thy @G are thy gods, O @.

2:29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed @

me, @
 the LORD.

2:30 In vain have I smitten your @; they received no
correction: your own @Q hath devoured your prophets, like a
destroying lion.

2:31 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
wilderness unto @? a land of darkness? wherefore say my @,
We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?  2:32 Can a maid forget
her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my @ have forgotten me
days @S number.

2:33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? @fore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways.

2:34 Also in thy skirts is @V the @I of the souls of the poor
innocents: I have not @V it by secret search, but upon all @.

2:35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger @
turn from me. @., I will plead with thee, @ thou sayest, I
have not sinned.

2:36 Why gaddest thou @+ so much to change thy way? thou also @
be ashamed of @-, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

2:37 Yea, thou @ go @ from him, and @ @D upon @
head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou @ not
prosper in them.

3:1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
become @F man's, @ he return unto her @*? @ not that
land be @ly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many
lovers; yet return @* to me, @
 the LORD.

3:2 Lift up @ eyes unto the high @'s, and see where thou hast
not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian
in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms
and with thy wickedness.

3:3 @N the showers have been withholden, and @ hath been no
latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be
ashamed.

3:4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My @, thou art the
guide of my youth?  3:5 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he
keep it to the end?  @., thou hast spoken and done evil @ as
thou couldest.

3:6 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast
thou seen that @ backsliding @ hath done? she is gone up upon
@ high mountain and @[ @ green tree, and @ hath played
the harlot.

3:7 And I said @ she had done all @ @, Turn thou unto me.
But she returned not. And her treacherous sister @ saw it.

3:8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding @
committed adultery I had put her away, and @= her a bill of
divorce; yet her treacherous sister @ feared not, but went and
played the harlot also.

3:9 And it came to pass @E the lightness of her whoredom, that
she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with
stocks.

3:10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister @ hath not turned
unto me with her whole @, but feignedly, @
 the LORD.

3:11 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding @ hath justified
herself more than treacherous @.

3:12 Go and proclaim @ @5 toward the north, and say, Return,
thou backsliding @, @
 the LORD; and I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, @
 the LORD, and I will
not keep anger for ever.

3:13 Only acknowledge @ iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
@
 the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers
@[ @ green tree, and ye have not obeyed my @;, @
 the
LORD.

3:14 Turn, O backsliding @, @
 the LORD; for I am married
unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and
I will @( you to Zion: 3:15 And I will give you pastors @$
to mine @, @ @ feed you with knowledge and @[standing.

3:16 And it @ come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in
the land, in @J days, @
 the LORD, they @ say no more, The
ark of the covenant of the LORD: @" @ it come to mind:
@" @ they remember it; @" @ they visit it; @"
@ that be done any more.

3:17 At that time they @ call @  the throne of the LORD;
and all the nations @ be ga@d unto it, to the name of the
LORD, to @ : @" @ they walk any more @ the
imagination of @ evil @.

3:18 In @J days the @ of @ @ walk with the @ of
@, and they @ come @? out of the land of the north to
the land that I have @= for an inheritance unto your @s.

3:19 But I said, How @ I put thee @ the @, and give
thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I
said, Thou @ call me, My @; and @ not turn away from me.

3:20 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
have ye dealt treacherously with me, O @ of @, @
 the
LORD.

3:21 A @; was @) upon the high @'s, weeping and supplications
of the @ of @: for they have perverted @ way, and they
have forgotten the LORD @ God.

3:22 Return, ye backsliding @, and I will heal your
backslidings.

@., we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.

3:23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of
@.

3:24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our @s from our youth;
@ flocks and @ herds, @ sons and @ daughters.

3:25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we
have sinned @
 the LORD our God, we and our @s, from our
youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the @; of the LORD
our God.

4:1 If thou wilt return, O @, @
 the LORD, return unto me: and
if thou wilt put away @ abominations out of my sight, then @
thou not remove.

4:2 And thou @ swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and
in @ceousness; and the nations @ bless @T in him, and
in him @ they @Y.

4:3 For thus @
 the LORD to the men of @ and @ , Break
up your fallow ground, and sow not @ thorns.

4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of
your @, ye men of @ and inhabitants of @ : lest my fury
come @ like fire, and burn that none can quench it, @ of the
evil of your doings.

4:5 Declare ye in @, and publish in @ ; and say, Blow ye
the trumpet in the land: cry, gather @?, and say, Assemble
yourselves, and let us go into the defenced @G.

4:6 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
@( evil from the north, and a @ destruction.

4:7 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
Gentiles is on his way; he is gone @ from his @' to make thy
land desolate; and thy @G @ be laid waste, @S an
inhabitant.

4:8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

4:9 And it @ come to pass at that day, @
 the LORD, that the
@ of the king @ perish, and the @ of the princes; and the
@6s @ be astonished, and the prophets @ wonder.

4:10 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast @ly deceived this
@ and @ , @, Ye @ have @U; whereas the @Q

4:11 At that time @ it be said to this @ and to @ , A

4:13 @., he @ come up as clouds, and his chariots @ be as

4:14 O @ , wash @ @ from wickedness, that thou mayest

For a @; declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount
Ephraim.

4:16 Make ye mention to the nations; @%, publish @

 the @G of @.

4:17 As keepers of a field, are they @

4:18 Thy way and thy doings have procured @ @ unto thee; this

4:19 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very @; my @

O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

4:20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.

4:21 How long @ I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
trumpet?  4:22 For my @ is foolish, they have not known me; they
are sottish @, and they have none @[standing: they are wise
to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

4:23 I beheld the @, and, lo, it was @S form, and void; and
the @1s, and they had no light.

4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
moved lightly.

4:25 I beheld, and, lo, @ was no man, and all the birds of the
@1s were fled.

4:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful @' was a wilderness, and all
the @G @of were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and
by his fierce anger.

4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land @ be desolate;
yet will I not make a full end.

4:28 For this @ the @ mourn, and the @1s above be black;
@ I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,
@" will I turn back from it.

4:29 The whole city @ flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen; they @ go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
@ city @ be forsaken, and not a man dwell @in.

4:30 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments
of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain @
thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek

4:31 For I have @) a @; as of a woman in travail, and the
anguish as of her that @(eth @ her @O child, the @; of

5:1 Run ye to and fro @E the streets of @ , and see now,

if @ be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I

5:2 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.

5:3 O LORD, are not @ eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they
have refused to receive correction: they have made @ faces harder
than a rock; they have refused to return.

5:4 @N I said, Surely @ are poor; they are foolish: for
they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of @ God.

5:5 I will get me unto the @ men, and will @K unto them; for

but @ have al@? broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.

5:6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest @ slay them, and a wolf of

5:7 How @ I pardon thee for this? thy @ have forsaken me,

5:12 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; @" @
evil come upon us; @" @ we see @Q nor famine: 5:13 And the
prophets @ become wind, and the word is not in them: thus @ it
be done unto them.

5:14 Wherefore thus @
 the LORD God of hosts, Because ye @K this
word, @%, I will make my @5 in thy @P fire, and this @
wood, and it @ devour them.

5:15 Lo, I will @( a nation upon you from far, O @ of @,
@
 the LORD: it is a @By nation, it is an ancient nation, a
nation whose language thou knowest not, @" @[standest what
they say.

5:16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all @By men.

5:17 And they @ eat up @ harvest, and thy @d, @ thy
sons and thy daughters @# eat: they @ eat up thy flocks and
@ herds: they @ eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they @
impoverish thy fenced @G, wherein thou trustedst, with the @Q.

5:18 Nevertheless in @J days, @
 the LORD, I will not make a
full end with you.

5:19 And it @ come to pass, when ye @ say, Wherefore doeth the
LORD our God all @ @ unto us? then @ thou answer them,
Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so
@ ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's.

5:20 Declare this in the @ of @], and publish it in @,
@, 5:21 Hear now this, O foolish @, and @S
@[standing; @ have eyes, and see not; @ have ears, and hear
not: 5:22 Fear ye not me? @
 the LORD: will ye not tremble at my
presence, @ have @'d the sand for the bound of the sea by a
perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves @of
toss @T, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can
they not pass over it?  5:23 But this @ hath a revolting and a
rebellious @; they are revolted and gone.

5:24 Neither say they in @ @, Let us now fear the LORD our
God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season:
he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

5:25 Your iniquities have turned away @ @, and your sins have
withholden good @ from you.

5:26 For @ my @ are @V wicked men: they lay wait, as he
that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

5:27 As a cage is full of birds, so are @ @s full of deceit:
@fore they are become @, and waxen rich.

5:28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of
the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the @less, yet
they prosper; and the @c of the needy do they not judge.

5:29 Shall I not visit for @ @? @
 the LORD: @ not my
soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  5:30 A wonderful and
horrible @7 is committed in the land; 5:31 The prophets prophesy
falsely, and the @6s bear rule by @ means; and my @ love
to have it so: and what will ye do in the end @of?  6:1 O ye
@ of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the @a of
@ , and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in
Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and @
destruction.

6:2 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
woman.

6:3 The shepherds with @ flocks @ come unto her; they @
pitch @ tents @
 her round @+; they @ feed @ one
in his @'.

6:4 Prepare ye war @
 her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are
stretched out.

6:5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

6:6 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast
a mount @
 @ : this is the city to be visited; she is
wholly oppression in the @a of her.

6:7 As a fountain casteth out her @Zs, so she casteth out her
wickedness: violence and spoil is @) in her; @	 me continually
is grief and wounds.

6:8 Be thou instructed, O @ , lest my soul depart from thee;
lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

6:9 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, They @ @Ely glean the
remnant of @ as a vine: turn back @ hand as a grapega@r
into the baskets.

6:10 To whom @ I @K, and give warning, that they may hear?
@%, @ ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: @%,
the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in
it.

6:11 @N I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with
holding in: I will pour it out upon the @ abroad, and upon the
assembly of young men @?: for even the husband with the wife
@ be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.

6:12 And @ @s @ be turned unto @Cs, with @ fields
and wives @?: for I will stretch out my hand upon the
inhabitants of the land, @
 the LORD.

6:13 For from the least of them even unto the @est of them @
one is @= to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the
@6 @ one dealeth falsely.

6:14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my @
slightly, @, Peace, @U; when @ is no @U.

6:15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
were not at all ashamed, @" could they blush: @fore they
@ fall @ them that fall: at the time that I visit them they
@ be cast down, @
 the LORD.

6:16 Thus @
 the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for
the old paths, where is the good way, and walk @in, and ye @
find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk @in.

6:17 Also I set watchmen over you, @, Hearken to the sound of the
trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

6:18 @N hear, ye nations, and know, O @`, what is
@ them.

6:19 Hear, O @: @%, I will @( evil upon this @, even
the fruit of @ thoughts, @ they have not hearkened unto my
@5, nor to my law, but rejected it.

6:20 To what purpose cometh @ to me incense from Sheba, and the
sweet cane from a far country? your @_ @&s are not
acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

6:21 @N thus @
 the LORD, @., I will lay stumblingblocks
@	 this @, and the @s and the sons @? @ fall
upon them; the neighbour and his friend @ perish.

6:22 Thus @
 the LORD, @., a @ cometh from the north
country, and a @ nation @ be raised from the sides of the
@.

6:23 They @ lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no
mercy; @ @; roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses,
set in array as men for war @
 thee, O daughter of Zion.

6:24 We have @) the fame @of: our @D wax feeble: anguish
hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

6:25 Go not @ into the field, nor walk by the way; for the @Q
of the enemy and fear is on @ side.

6:26 O daughter of my @, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter
lamentation: for the spoiler @ suddenly come upon us.

6:27 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress @ my @, that
thou mayest know and try @ way.

6:28 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

6:29 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
@Ver melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

6:30 Reprobate silver @ men call them, @ the LORD hath
rejected them.

7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, @, 7:2 Stand in
the gate of the LORD's @, and proclaim @ this word, and say,
Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of @, that enter in at @
gates to worship the LORD.

7:3 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @, Amend your ways
and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this @'.

7:4 Trust ye not in lying @5, @, The temple of the LORD, The
temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are @.

7:5 For if ye @Ely amend your ways and your doings; if ye
@Ely execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; 7:6 If ye
oppress not the stranger, the @less, and the widow, and shed not
innocent @I in this @', @" walk @ @C gods to your
hurt: 7:7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this @', in the land
that I gave to your @s, for ever and ever.

7:8 @., ye trust in lying @5, that cannot profit.

7:9 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
burn incense unto Baal, and walk @ @C gods whom ye know not;
7:10 And come and stand @	 me in this @, @ is @, by my
name, and say, We are delivered to do all @ abominations?  7:11 Is
this @, @ is @, by my name, become a den of robbers in
your eyes? @., even I have seen it, @
 the LORD.

7:12 But go ye now unto my @' @ was in Shiloh, where I set my
name at the @O, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
@ @.

7:13 And now, @ ye have done all @ works, @
 the LORD,
and I @0 unto you, rising up early and @King, but ye @) not;
and I @, you, but ye @> not; 7:14 @N will I do unto
this @, @ is @, by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the
@' @ I gave to you and to your @s, as I have done to
Shiloh.

7:15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
@3, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

7:16 @N pray not thou for this @, @" lift up cry nor
prayer for them, @" make intercession to me: for I will not hear
thee.

7:17 Seest thou not what they do in the @G of @ and in the
streets of @ ?  7:18 The @ gather wood, and the @s
kindle the fire, and the women knead @ dough, to make cakes to the
queen of @1, and to pour out @b @&s unto @C gods, that
they may provoke me to anger.

7:19 Do they provoke me to anger? @
 the LORD: do they not provoke
@T to the confusion of @ own faces?  7:20 @N thus
@
 the Lord GOD; @., mine anger and my fury @ be poured out
upon this @', upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the
field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it @ burn, and @
not be quenched.

7:21 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Put your @_
@&s unto your sacrifices, and eat @R.

7:22 For I @0 not unto your @s, nor @M them in the day
that I @ them out of the land of @-, concerning @_
@&s or sacrifices: 7:23 But this @7 @M I them, @,
Obey my @;, and I will be your God, and ye @ be my @: and
walk ye in all the ways that I have @M you, that it may be well
unto you.

7:24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined @ ear, but walked in the
counsels and in the imagination of @ evil @, and went
backward, and not forward.

7:25 Since the day that your @s came @ out of the land of
@- unto this day I have even sent unto you all my @<s the
prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 7:26 Yet they
hearkened not unto me, nor inclined @ ear, but hardened @
neck: they did worse than @ @s.

7:27 @N thou @ @K all @ @5 unto them; but they
will not hearken to thee: thou @ also call unto them; but they
will not answer thee.

7:28 But thou @ say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not
the @; of the LORD @ God, nor receiveth correction: truth is
perished, and is cut off from @ @P.

7:29 Cut off @ hair, O @ , and cast it away, and take up a
lamentation on high @'s; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken
the generation of his wrath.

7:30 For the @ of @ have done evil in my sight, @
 the
LORD: they have set @ abominations in the @ @ is @, by
my name, to pollute it.

7:31 And they have built the high @'s of Tophet, @ is in the
valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn @ sons and @ daughters in
the fire; @ I @M them not, @" came it into my @.

7:32 @N, @%, the days come, @
 the LORD, that it @
no more be @, Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the
valley of slaughter: for they @ bury in Tophet, till @ be no
@'.

7:33 And the carcases of this @ @ be meat for the fowls of
the @1, and for the beasts of the @; and none @ fray them
away.

7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the @G of @, and from the
streets of @ , the @; of mirth, and the @; of gladness,
the @; of the bridegroom, and the @; of the bride: for the land
@ be desolate.

8:1 At that time, @
 the LORD, they @ @( out the bones of
the kings of @, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the
@6s, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the
inhabitants of @ , out of @ graves: 8:2 And they @
spread them @	 the sun, and the moon, and all the host of @1,
whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and @ whom they
have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:
they @ not be ga@d, nor be buried; they @ be for dung upon
the face of the @.

8:3 And @^ @ be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
them that remain of this evil family, @ remain in all the @'s
whither I have driven them, @
 the LORD of hosts.

8:4 Moreover thou @ say unto them, Thus @
 the LORD; Shall they
fall, and not arise? @ he turn away, and not return?  8:5 Why then
is this @ of @  slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?
they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

8:6 I hearkened and @), but they @0 not a@c: no man repented
him of his wickedness, @, What have I done? @ one turned to
his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.

8:7 Yea, the stork in the @1 knoweth her appointed times; and the
turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of @ coming;
but my @ know not the judgment of the LORD.

8:8 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?
Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

8:9 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?  8:10
@N will I give @ wives unto @Cs, and @ fields to
them that @ inherit them: for @ one from the least even unto
the @est is @= to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the
@6 @ one dealeth falsely.

8:11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my @
slightly, @, Peace, @U; when @ is no @U.

8:12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
were not at all ashamed, @" could they blush: @fore @
they fall @ them that fall: in the time of @ visitation they
@ be cast down, @
 the LORD.

8:13 I will surely consume them, @
 the LORD: @ @ be no
grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf @ fade;
and the @ that I have @= them @ pass away from them.

8:14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into
the defenced @G, and let us be silent @: for the LORD our God
hath put us to silence, and @= us @Z of gall to @b, @
we have sinned @
 the LORD.

8:15 We looked for @U, but no good came; and for a time of health,
and @% trouble!  8:16 The snorting of his horses was @) from
Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his
strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all
that is in it; the city, and @J that dwell @in.

8:17 For, @%, I will send serpents, cockatrices, @ you, @
will not be charmed, and they @ bite you, @
 the LORD.

8:18 When I @L comfort myself @
 sorrow, my @ is faint in
me.

8:19 @. the @; of the cry of the daughter of my @ @
of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not
her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with @ graven
images, and with strange vanities?  8:20 The harvest is past, the
summer is ended, and we are not saved.

8:21 For the hurt of the daughter of my @ am I hurt; I am black;
astonishment hath taken hold on me.

8:22 Is @ no balm in Gilead; is @ no physician @? why then
is not the health of the daughter of my @ recovered?  9:1 Oh that
my head were @Zs, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I @B
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my @!  9:2 Oh
that I had in the wilderness a lodging @' of wayfaring men; that I
@B leave my @, and go from them! for they be all adulterers,
an assembly of treacherous men.

9:3 And they bend @ tongues like @ bow for lies: but they are
not valiant for the truth upon the @; for they proceed from evil
to evil, and they know not me, @
 the LORD.

9:4 Take ye heed @ one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
@X: for @ @X will utterly supplant, and @ neighbour
will walk with slanders.

9:5 And they will deceive @ one his neighbour, and will not @K
the truth: they have taught @ tongue to @K lies, and weary
@T to commit iniquity.

9:6 Thine habitation is in the @a of deceit; @E deceit they
refuse to know me, @
 the LORD.

9:7 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts, @., I will melt them,
and try them; for how @ I do for the daughter of my @?  9:8
Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it @Keth deceit: one @Keth
@Uably to his neighbour with his @P, but in @ he layeth his
wait.

9:9 Shall I not visit them for @ @? @
 the LORD: @ not
my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  9:10 For the mountains
will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the
wilderness a lamentation, @ they are burned up, so that none can
pass @E them; @" can men hear the @; of the cattle; both
the fowl of the @1s and the beast are fled; they are gone.

9:11 And I will make @  heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will
make the @G of @ desolate, @S an inhabitant.

9:12 Who is the wise man, that may @[stand this? and who is he to
whom the @P of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for
what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none
passeth @E?  9:13 And the LORD @
, Because they have forsaken
my law @ I set @	 them, and have not obeyed my @;, @"
walked @in; 9:14 But have walked @ the imagination of @
own @, and @ Baalim, @ @ @s taught them: 9:15
@N thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; @., I
will feed them, even this @, with wormwood, and give them @Z
of gall to @b.

9:16 I will scatter them also @ the heathen, whom @" they nor
@ @s have known: and I will send a @Q @ them, till I
have consumed them.

9:17 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that
they may come: 9:18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for
us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out
with @Zs.

9:19 For a @; of wailing is @) out of Zion, How are we spoiled!
we are @ly con@Ved, @ we have forsaken the land, @
our dwellings have cast us out.

9:20 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear
receive the word of his @P, and teach your daughters wailing, and
@ one her neighbour lamentation.

9:21 For @^ is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
palaces, to cut off the @ from @S, and the young men from
the streets.

9:22 Speak, Thus @
 the LORD, Even the carcases of men @ fall
as dung upon the open field, and as the handful @ the harvestman,
and none @ gather them.

9:23 Thus @
 the LORD, Let not the wise man @Y in his wisdom,
@" let the @By man @Y in his @B, let not the rich man
@Y in his riches: 9:24 But let him that glorieth @Y in this,
that he @[standeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD @
exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and @ceousness, in the @:
for in @ @ I delight, @
 the LORD.

9:25 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will punish all
them @ are circumcised with the uncircumcised; 9:26 @-, and
@, and Edom, and the @ of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are
in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all @
nations are uncircumcised, and all the @ of @ are
uncircumcised in the @.

10:1 Hear ye the word @ the LORD @Keth unto you, O @ of
@: 10:2 Thus @
 the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen,
and be not dismayed at the signs of @1; for the heathen are
dismayed at them.

10:3 For the customs of the @ are vain: for one cutteth a tree
out of the forest, the work of the @D of the workman, with the axe.

10:4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
and with hammers, that it move not.

10:5 They are up@c as the palm tree, but @K not: they must needs
be borne, @ they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they
cannot do evil, @" also is it in them to do good.

10:6 Forasmuch as @ is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
@, and thy name is @ in @B.

10:7 Who @L not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
appertain: forasmuch as @ all the wise men of the nations, and in
all @ kingdoms, @ is none like unto thee.

10:8 But they are al@? brutish and foolish: the stock is a
doctrine of vanities.

10:9 Silver spread into plates is @ from Tarshish, and gold from
Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the @D of the @Ver: blue
and purple is @ clo@7: they are all the work of cunning men.

10:10 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
everlasting king: at his wrath the @ @ tremble, and the
nations @ not be able to abide his indignation.

10:11 Thus @ ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
@1s and the @, even they @ perish from the @, and from
@[ @ @1s.

10:12 He hath made the @ by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the @1s by his
discretion.

10:13 When he uttereth his @;, @ is a multitude of @Zs in
the @1s, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
@; he maketh lightnings with rain, and @(eth @ the wind out
of his treasures.

10:14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: @ @Ver is
con@Ved by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and
@ is no breath in them.

10:15 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of @
visitation they @ perish.

10:16 The portion of @] is not like them: for he is the former of
all @; and @ is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of
hosts is his name.

10:17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
fortress.

10:18 For thus @
 the LORD, @., I will sling out the
inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that
they may find it so.

10:19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
this is a grief, and I must bear it.

10:20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
@ are gone @ of me, and they are not: @ is none to
stretch @ my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

10:21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
LORD: @fore they @ not prosper, and all @ flocks @ be
scattered.

10:22 @., the noise of the bruit is come, and a @ commotion
out of the north country, to make the @G of @ desolate, and a
den of dragons.

10:23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in @9: it is not
in man that walketh to direct his steps.

10:24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in @ anger, lest
thou @( me to no@7.

10:25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up @],
and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation
desolate.

11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD @, 11:2 Hear ye
the @5 of this covenant, and @K unto the men of @, and to
the inhabitants of @ ; 11:3 And say thou unto them, Thus @

the LORD God of @; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the @5
of this covenant, 11:4 Which I @M your @s in the day that
I @ them @ out of the land of @-, from the iron furnace,
@, Obey my @;, and do them, @$ to all @ I command
you: so @ ye be my @, and I will be your God: 11:5 That I may
perform the oath @ I have sworn unto your @s, to give them a
land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then @> I,
and said, So be it, O LORD.

11:6 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all @ @5 in the
@G of @, and in the streets of @ , @, Hear ye the
@5 of this covenant, and do them.

11:7 For I earnestly protested unto your @s in the day that I
@ them up out of the land of @-, even unto this day, rising
early and protesting, @, Obey my @;.

11:8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined @ ear, but walked @ one
in the imagination of @ evil @: @fore I will @( upon
them all the @5 of this covenant, @ I @M them to do: but
they did them not.

11:9 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is @V @ the men of
@, and @ the inhabitants of @ .

11:10 They are turned back to the iniquities of @ fore@s,
@ refused to hear my @5; and they went @ @C gods to
serve them: the @ of @ and the @ of @ have broken my
covenant @ I made with @ @s.

11:11 @N thus @
 the LORD, @., I will @( evil upon
them, @ they @ not be able to escape; and though they @
cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.

11:12 Then @ the @G of @ and inhabitants of @  go,
and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they @ not
save them at all in the time of @ trouble.

11:13 For @$ to the number of thy @G were thy gods, O
@; and @$ to the number of the streets of @  have ye
set up @\s to that shameful @7, even @\s to burn incense unto
Baal.

11:14 @N pray not thou for this @, @" lift up a cry
or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry
unto me for @ trouble.

11:15 What hath my beloved to do in mine @, seeing she hath
wrought lewdness with many, and the holy @R is passed from thee?
when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.

11:16 The LORD @, thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of
goodly fruit: with the noise of a @ tumult he hath kindled fire
upon it, and the branches of it are broken.

11:17 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
@
 thee, for the evil of the @ of @ and of the @ of
@, @ they have done @
 @T to provoke me to anger
in @& incense unto Baal.

11:18 And the LORD hath @= me knowledge of it, and I know it: then
thou shewedst me @ doings.

11:19 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is @ to the slaughter;
and I knew not that they had devised devices @
 me, @, Let
us destroy the tree with the fruit @of, and let us cut him off
from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.

11:20 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest @ceously, that triest the
reins and the @, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee
have I revealed my cause.

11:21 @N thus @
 the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek
thy life, @, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die
not by our hand: 11:22 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts, @.,
I will punish them: the young men @ die by the @Q; @ sons
and @ daughters @ die by famine: 11:23 And @ @ be no
remnant of them: for I will @( evil upon the men of Anathoth, even
the year of @ visitation.

12:1 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked
prosper?  wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
12:2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
yea, they @( @ fruit: thou art near in @ @P, and far
from @ reins.

12:3 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine
@ toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and
prepare them for the day of slaughter.

12:4 How long @ the land mourn, and the herbs of @ field
wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell @in? the beasts are
consumed, and the birds; @ they said, He @ not see our last
end.

12:5 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of @U,
wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in
the swelling of Jordan?  12:6 For even thy @3, and the @ of
thy @, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they
have @, a multitude @ thee: believe them not, though they
@K fair @5 unto thee.

12:7 I have forsaken mine @, I have left mine heritage; I have
@= the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.

12:8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out
@
 me: @fore have I hated it.

12:9 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round
@+ are @
 her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field,
come to devour.

12:10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
portion @[ foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate
wilderness.

12:11 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto
me; the whole land is made desolate, @ no man layeth it to
@.

12:12 The spoilers are come upon all high @'s @E the
wilderness: for the @Q of the LORD @ devour from the one end of
the land even to the @C end of the land: no @R @ have @U.

12:13 They have sown wheat, but @ reap thorns: they have put
@T to pain, but @ not profit: and they @ be ashamed of
your revenues @ of the fierce anger of the LORD.

12:14 Thus @
 the LORD @
 all mine evil neighbours, that touch
the inheritance @ I have caused my @ @ to inherit;
@., I will pluck them out of @ land, and pluck out the @
of @ from @ them.

12:15 And it @ come to pass, @ that I have plucked them out I
will return, and have compassion on them, and will @( them @*,
@ man to his heritage, and @ man to his land.

12:16 And it @ come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
ways of my @, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they
taught my @ to swear by Baal; then @ they be built in the
@a of my @.

12:17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy
that nation, @
 the LORD.

13:1 Thus @
 the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and
put it upon thy loins, and put it not in @Z.

13:2 So I got a girdle @$ to the word of the LORD, and put it
on my loins.

13:3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, @,
13:4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, @ is upon thy loins, and
arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it @ in a hole of the rock.

13:5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD @M me.

13:6 And it came to pass @ many days, that the LORD said unto me,
Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, @ I
@M thee to hide @.

13:7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
the @' where I had hid it: and, @%, the girdle was marred, it
was profitable for no@7.

13:8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 13:9 Thus @

the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of @, and the
@ pride of @ .

13:10 This evil @, @ refuse to hear my @5, @ walk in
the imagination of @ @, and walk @ @C gods, to serve
them, and to worship them, @ even be as this girdle, @ is good
for no@7.

13:11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
caused to cleave unto me the whole @ of @ and the whole @
of @, @
 the LORD; that they @B be unto me for a @, and
for a name, and for a praise, and for a @Y: but they @L not
hear.

13:12 @N thou @ @K unto them this word; Thus @
 the
LORD God of @, Every bottle @ be filled with wine: and they
@ say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that @ bottle @
be filled with wine?  13:13 Then @ thou say unto them, Thus @

the LORD, @., I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even
the kings that sit upon @'s throne, and the @6s, and the
prophets, and all the inhabitants of @ , with drunkenness.

13:14 And I will dash them one @
 @F, even the @s and
the sons @?, @
 the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor
have mercy, but destroy them.

13:15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

13:16 Give @Y to the LORD your God, @	 he cause darkness, and
@	 your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look
for light, he turn it into the shadow of @^, and make it gross
darkness.

13:17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul @ weep in secret @'s
for your pride; and mine eye @ weep sore, and run down with tears,
@ the LORD's flock is carried away captive.

13:18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:
for your principalities @ come down, even the crown of your @Y.

13:19 The @G of the south @ be shut up, and none @ open
them: @ @ be carried away captive all of it, it @ be
wholly carried away captive.

13:20 Lift up your eyes, and @% them that come from the north:
where is the flock that was @= thee, thy beautiful flock?  13:21
What wilt thou say when he @ punish thee? for thou hast taught
them to be captains, and as chief over thee: @ not sorrows take
thee, as a woman in travail?  13:22 And if thou say in @ @,
Wherefore come @ @ upon me?  For the @ness of @
iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.

13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

13:24 @N will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
by the wind of the wilderness.

13:25 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, @
 the
LORD; @ thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.

13:26 @N will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
shame may appear.

13:27 I have seen @ adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of
thy whoredom, and @ abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe
unto thee, O @ ! wilt thou not be made clean? when @ it
once be?  14:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning
the d@.

14:2 @ mourneth, and the gates @of languish; they are black
unto the ground; and the cry of @  is gone up.

14:3 And @ nobles have sent @ little ones to the @Zs: they
came to the pits, and @V no @Z; they returned with @ vessels
empty; they were ashamed and con@Ved, and covered @ heads.

14:4 Because the ground is chapt, for @ was no rain in the @,
the plowmen were ashamed, they covered @ heads.

14:5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, @
@ was no grass.

14:6 And the wild asses did stand in the high @'s, they snuffed up
the wind like dragons; @ eyes did fail, @ @ was no
grass.

14:7 O LORD, though our iniquities testify @
 us, do thou it for
thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned @

thee.

14:8 O the hope of @, the saviour @of in time of trouble, why
@#est thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man
that turneth aside to tarry for a night?  14:9 Why @#est thou be
as a man astonied, as a @By man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD,
art in the @a of us, and we are @, by thy name; leave us not.

14:10 Thus @
 the LORD unto this @, Thus have they loved to
wander, they have not refrained @ feet, @fore the LORD doth
not accept them; he will now remember @ iniquity, and visit @
sins.

14:11 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this @ for @
good.

14:12 When they fast, I will not hear @ cry; and when they offer
@_ @& and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will
consume them by the @Q, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

14:13 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! @%, the prophets say unto them,
Ye @ not see the @Q, @" @ ye have famine; but I will
give you assured @U in this @'.

14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
name: I sent them not, @" have I @M them, @" @0
unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a
@7 of nought, and the deceit of @ @.

14:15 @N thus @
 the LORD concerning the prophets that
prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and
famine @ not be in this land; By @Q and famine @ @J
prophets be consumed.

14:16 And the @ to whom they prophesy @ be cast out in the
streets of @  @ of the famine and the @Q; and they
@ have none to bury them, them, @ wives, nor @ sons, nor
@ daughters: for I will pour @ wickedness upon them.

14:17 @N thou @ say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run
down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin
daughter of my @ is broken with a @ breach, with a very
grievous blow.

14:18 If I go @ into the field, then @% the slain with the
@Q!  and if I enter into the city, then @% them that are sick
with famine!  yea, both the prophet and the @6 go @+ into a
land that they know not.

14:19 Hast thou utterly rejected @? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why
hast thou smitten us, and @ is no healing for us? we looked for
@U, and @ is no good; and for the time of healing, and @%
trouble!  14:20 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the
iniquity of our @s: for we have sinned @
 thee.

14:21 Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne
of thy @Y: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

14:22 Are @ any @ the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
rain? or can the @1s give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our
God?  @fore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all @
@.

15:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Though @ and Samuel stood @	
me, yet my mind could not be toward this @: cast them out of my
sight, and let them go @.

15:2 And it @ come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither @
we go @? then thou @ tell them, Thus @
 the LORD; Such as
are for @^, to @^; and such as are for the @Q, to the @Q;
and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the
captivity, to the captivity.

15:3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, @
 the LORD: the
@Q to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the @1, and
the beasts of the @, to devour and destroy.

15:4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
@, @ of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of @, for that
@ he did in @ .

15:5 For who @ have pity upon thee, O @ ? or who @
bemoan thee? or who @ go aside to ask how thou doest?  15:6 Thou
hast forsaken me, @
 the LORD, thou art gone backward: @fore
will I stretch out my hand @
 thee, and destroy thee; I am weary
with repenting.

15:7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will
bereave them of @, I will destroy my @ since they return
not from @ ways.

15:8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I
have @ upon them @
 the m@C of the young men a spoiler
at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors
upon the city.

15:9 She that hath borne @H languisheth: she hath @= up the
ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been
ashamed and con@Ved: and the residue of them will I deliver to the
@Q @	 @ enemies, @
 the LORD.

15:10 Woe is me, my m@C, that thou hast borne me a man of strife
and a man of contention to the whole @! I have @" lent on
usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet @ one of them doth
curse me.

15:11 The LORD said, Verily it @ be well with thy remnant; verily
I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in
the time of affliction.

15:12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?  15:13 Thy
substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil @S price,
and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.

15:14 And I will make thee to pass with @ enemies into a land
@ thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, @
@ burn upon you.

15:15 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me
of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that
for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

15:16 Thy @5 were @V, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto
me the joy and rejoicing of mine @: for I am @, by thy name, O
LORD God of hosts.

15:17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
alone @ of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.

15:18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, @ refuseth
to be healed? wilt thou be al@? unto me as a liar, and as @Zs
that fail?  15:19 @N thus @
 the LORD, If thou return, then
will I @( thee @*, and thou @ stand @	 me: and if thou
take @ the precious from the vile, thou @ be as my @P: let
them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

15:20 And I will make thee unto this @ a fenced brasen wall: and
they @ fight @
 thee, but they @ not prevail @

thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, @
 the
LORD.

15:21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

16:1 The word of the LORD came also unto me, @, 16:2 Thou @
not take thee a wife, @" @ thou have sons or daughters in
this @'.

16:3 For thus @
 the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
daughters that are born in this @', and concerning @ m@Cs
that bare them, and concerning @ @s that begat them in this
land; 16:4 They @ die of grievous @^s; they @ not be
lamented; @" @ they be buried; but they @ be as dung upon
the face of the @: and they @ be consumed by the @Q, and by
famine; and @ carcases @ be meat for the fowls of @1, and
for the beasts of the @.

16:5 For thus @
 the LORD, Enter not into the @ of mourning,
@" go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my @U
from this @, @
 the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.

16:6 Both the @ and the small @ die in this land: they @
not be buried, @" @ men lament for them, nor cut @T,
nor make @T bald for them: 16:7 Neither @ men tear
@T for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; @"
@ men give them the cup of consolation to @b for @ @
or for @ m@C.

16:8 Thou @ not also go into the @ of feasting, to sit with
them to eat and to @b.

16:9 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; @., I
will cause to cease out of this @' in your eyes, and in your days,
the @; of mirth, and the @; of gladness, the @; of the
bridegroom, and the @; of the bride.

16:10 And it @ come to pass, when thou @ shew this @ all
@ @5, and they @ say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD
pronounced all this @ evil @
 us? or what is our iniquity? or
what is our sin that we have committed @
 the LORD our God?
16:11 Then @ thou say unto them, Because your @s have
forsaken me, @
 the LORD, and have walked @ @C gods, and
have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and
have not kept my law; 16:12 And ye have done worse than your @s;
for, @%, ye walk @ one @ the imagination of his evil
@, that they may not hearken unto me: 16:13 @N will I cast
you out of this land into a land that ye know not, @" ye nor your
@s; and @ @ ye serve @C gods day and night; where I
will not shew you favour.

16:14 @N, @%, the days come, @
 the LORD, that it @
no more be said, The LORD liveth, that @ up the @ of
@ out of the land of @-; 16:15 But, The LORD liveth, that
@ up the @ of @ from the land of the north, and from
all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will @( them @*
into @ land that I gave unto @ @s.

16:16 @., I will send for many fishers, @
 the LORD, and they
@ fish them; and @ will I send for many hunters, and they
@ hunt them from @ mountain, and from @ hill, and out of
the holes of the rocks.

16:17 For mine eyes are upon all @ ways: they are not hid from my
face, @" is @ iniquity hid from mine eyes.

16:18 And @O I will recompense @ iniquity and @ sin double;
@ they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance
with the carcases of @ detestable and abominable @.

16:19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
of affliction, the Gentiles @ come unto thee from the ends of the
@, and @ say, Surely our @s have inherited lies, vanity,
and @ wherein @ is no profit.

16:20 Shall a man make gods unto @9, and they are no gods?  16:21
@N, @%, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause
them to know mine hand and my @B; and they @ know that my name
is The LORD.

17:1 The sin of @ is written with a pen of iron, and with the
point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of @ @, and
upon the horns of your @\s; 17:2 Whilst @ @ remember
@ @\s and @ groves by the green trees upon the high hills.

17:3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
treasures to the spoil, and thy high @'s for sin, @Eout all
thy borders.

17:4 And thou, even thyself, @ discontinue from @ heritage
that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve @ enemies in the
land @ thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,
@ @ burn for ever.

17:5 Thus @
 the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
maketh @R his arm, and whose @ departeth from the LORD.

17:6 For he @ be like the heath in the desert, and @ not see
when good cometh; but @ inhabit the parched @'s in the
wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the
LORD is.

17:8 For he @ be as a tree planted by the @Zs, and that
spreadeth out her roots by the river, and @ not see when heat
cometh, but her leaf @ be green; and @ not be careful in the
year of drought, @" @ cease from yielding fruit.

17:9 The @ is deceitful above all @, and desperately wicked:
who can know it?  17:10 I the LORD search the @, I try the reins,
even to give @ man @$ to his ways, and @$ to the
fruit of his doings.

17:11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he
that getteth riches, and not by @c, @ leave them in the @a

17:12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the @' of our
sanctuary.

17:13 O LORD, the hope of @, all that forsake thee @ be
ashamed, and they that depart from me @ be written in the @,
@ they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living @Zs.

17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I @ be healed; save me, and I @ be
saved: for thou art my praise.

17:15 @., they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it
come now.

17:16 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
thee: @" have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that @
came out of my lips was @c @	 thee.

17:17 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.

17:18 Let them be con@Ved that persecute me, but let not me be
con@Ved: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: @(
upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

17:19 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
@ of the @, whereby the kings of @ come in, and by the
@ they go out, and in all the gates of @ ; 17:20 And say
unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of @, and all
@, and all the inhabitants of @ , that enter in by @
gates: 17:21 Thus @
 the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no
burden on the sabbath day, nor @( it in by the gates of @ ;
17:22 Neither carry @ a burden out of your @s on the sabbath
day, @" do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I
@M your @s.

17:23 But they obeyed not, @" inclined @ ear, but made @
neck stiff, that they @B not hear, nor receive instruction.

17:24 And it @ come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
@
 the LORD, to @( in no burden @E the gates of this city
on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work @in;
17:25 Then @ @ enter into the gates of this city kings and
princes sitting upon the throne of @, riding in chariots and on
horses, they, and @ princes, the men of @, and the inhabitants

17:26 And they @ come from the @G of @, and from the

@&s, and sacrifices, and meat @&s, and incense, and
@(ing sacrifices of praise, unto the @ of the LORD.

17:27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of @ 
on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates @of,
and it @ devour the palaces of @ , and it @ not be

18:1 The word @ came to Jeremiah from the LORD, @, 18:2
Arise, and go down to the potter's @, and @ I will cause thee
to hear my @5.

18:3 Then I went down to the potter's @, and, @%, he wrought a
work on the wheels.

18:4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
potter: so he made it @* @F vessel, as seemed good to the
potter to make it.

18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, @, 18:6 O @ of
@, cannot I do with you as this potter? @
 the LORD. @.,
as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O @
of @.

18:7 At what instant I @ @K concerning a nation, and concerning
a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; 18:8 If
that nation, @
 whom I have pronounced, turn from @ evil, I
will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.

18:9 And at what instant I @ @K concerning a nation, and
concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 18:10 If it do evil in
my sight, that it obey not my @;, then I will repent of the good,
wherewith I said I @L benefit them.

18:11 Now @fore go to, @K to the men of @, and to the
inhabitants of @ , @, Thus @
 the LORD; @., I frame
evil @
 you, and devise a device @
 you: return ye now @

18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk @ our own
devices, and we will @ one do the imagination of his evil @.

18:13 @N thus @
 the LORD; Ask ye now @ the heathen, who
hath @) such @: the virgin of @ hath done a very horrible
@7.

18:14 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon @ cometh from the rock
of the field? or @ the cold flowing @Zs that come from @F
@' be forsaken?  18:15 Because my @ hath forgotten me, they
have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in
@ ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast
up; 18:16 To make @ land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; @
one that passeth @by @ be astonished, and wag his head.

18:17 I will scatter them as with an east wind @	 the enemy; I
will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of @
calamity.

18:18 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices @
 Jeremiah;
for the law @ not perish from the @6, nor counsel from the
wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with
the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his @5.

18:19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the @; of them that
contend with me.

18:20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
for my soul. Remember that I stood @	 thee to @K good for them,
and to turn away thy wrath from them.

18:21 @N deliver up @ @ to the famine, and pour out
@ @I by the force of the @Q; and let @ wives be bereaved
of @ @, and be widows; and let @ men be put to @^;
let @ young men be slain by the @Q in battle.

18:22 Let a cry be @) from @ @s, when thou @ @( a

hid snares for my feet.

18:23 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all @ counsel @
 me to slay me:
forgive not @ iniquity, @" blot out @ sin from thy sight,
but let them be overthrown @	 thee; deal thus with them in the
time of @ anger.

19:1 Thus @
 the LORD, Go and get a potter's @en bottle, and
take of the ancients of the @, and of the ancients of the
@6s; 19:2 And go @ unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, @

 the LORD of hosts,
the God of @; @., I will @( evil upon this @', the
@ whosoever heareth, his ears @ tingle.

19:4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this @', and
have burned incense in it unto @C gods, whom @" they nor @
@s have known, nor the kings of @, and have filled this @'
with the @I of innocents; 19:5 They have built also the high @'s
of Baal, to burn @ sons with fire for @_ @&s unto Baal,
@ I @M not, nor @0 it, @" came it into my mind:
19:6 @N, @%, the days come, @
 the LORD, that this @'
@ no more be @, Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom,
but The valley of slaughter.

19:7 And I will make void the counsel of @ and @  in this
@'; and I will cause them to fall by the @Q @	 @
enemies, and by the @D of them that seek @ lives: and @
carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the @1, and for
the beasts of the @.

19:8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; @ one
that passeth @by @ be astonished and hiss @ of all the
plagues @of.

19:9 And I will cause them to eat the @R of @ sons and the
@R of @ daughters, and they @ eat @ one the @R of
his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith @ enemies, and
they that seek @ lives, @ straiten them.

19:10 Then @ thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
with thee, 19:11 And @ say unto them, Thus @
 the LORD of
hosts; Even so will I break this @ and this city, as one breaketh
a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole @*: and they @
bury them in Tophet, till @ be no @' to bury.

19:12 Thus will I do unto this @', @
 the LORD, and to the
inhabitants @of, and even make this city as Tophet: 19:13 And the
@s of @ , and the @s of the kings of @, @ be
defiled as the @' of Tophet, @ of all the @s upon whose
roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of @1, and have
poured out @b @&s unto @C gods.

19:14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's @; and said to
all the @, 19:15 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @;
@., I will @( upon this city and upon all her towns all the
evil that I have pronounced @
 it, @ they have hardened
@ necks, that they @B not hear my @5.

20:1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the @6, who was also chief
governor in the @ of the LORD, @) that Jeremiah prophesied
@ @.

20:2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
that were in the high gate of Benjamin, @ was by the @ of the
LORD.

20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur @ @
Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath
not @, thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

20:4 For thus @
 the LORD, @., I will make thee a terror to
thyself, and to all thy friends: and they @ fall by the @Q of
@ enemies, and @ eyes @ @% it: and I will give all
@ into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he @ carry them
captive into Babylon, and @ slay them with the @Q.

20:5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
the labours @of, and all the precious @ @of, and all the
treasures of the kings of @ will I give into the hand of @
enemies, @ @ spoil them, and take them, and carry them to
Babylon.

20:6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in @ @ @ go into
captivity: and thou @ come to Babylon, and @ thou @ die,
and @ be buried @, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou
hast prophesied lies.

20:7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, @ one
mocketh me.

20:8 For since I @0, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
@ the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a
derision, daily.

20:9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor @K any more
in his name. But his word was in mine @ as a burning fire shut up
in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.

20:10 For I @) the defaming of many, fear on @ side. Report,
say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my
halting, @, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we @ prevail
@
 him, and we @ take our revenge on him.

20:11 But the LORD is with me as a @By terrible one: @fore my
persecutors @ stumble, and they @ not prevail: they @ be
@ly ashamed; for they @ not prosper: @ everlasting
confusion @ never be forgotten.

20:12 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the @ceous, and seest the
reins and the @, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee
have I opened my cause.

20:13 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

20:14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my
m@C bare me be blessed.

20:15 Cursed be the man who @ tidings to my @, @, A
man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

20:16 And let that man be as the @G @ the LORD overthrew, and
repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the
shouting at noontide; 20:17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or
that my m@C @B have been my grave, and her womb to be always
@ with me.

20:18 Wherefore came I @ out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
that my days @# be consumed with shame?  21:1 The word @ came
unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur
the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the @6,
@, 21:2 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war @
 us; if so be that
the LORD will deal with us @$ to all his wondrous works, that
he may go up from us.

21:3 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus @ ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4
Thus @
 the LORD God of @; @., I will turn back the
weapons of war that are in your @D, wherewith ye fight @
 the
king of Babylon, and @
 the Chaldeans, @ besiege you @S
the walls, and I will assemble them into the @a of this city.

21:5 And I myself will fight @
 you with an outstretched hand and
with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in @ wrath.

21:6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
beast: they @ die of a @ pestilence.

21:7 And @ward, @
 the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
@, and his @<s, and the @, and such as are left in this
city from the pestilence, from the @Q, and from the famine, into
the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of @
enemies, and into the hand of @J that seek @ life: and he @
smite them with the edge of the @Q; he @ not spare them,
@" have pity, nor have mercy.

21:8 And unto this @ thou @ say, Thus @
 the LORD; @.,
I set @	 you the way of life, and the way of @^.

21:9 He that abideth in this city @ die by the @Q, and by the
famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to
the Chaldeans that besiege you, he @ live, and his life @ be
unto him for a prey.

21:10 For I have set my face @
 this city for evil, and not for
good, @
 the LORD: it @ be @= into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and he @ burn it with fire.

21:11 And touching the @ of the king of @, say, Hear ye the
word of the LORD; 21:12 O @ of @, thus @
 the LORD; Execute
judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the
hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that
none can quench it, @ of the evil of your doings.

21:13 @., I am @
 thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock
of the plain, @
 the LORD; @ say, Who @ come down @

us? or who @ enter into our habitations?  21:14 But I will punish
you @$ to the fruit of your doings, @
 the LORD: and I will
kindle a fire in the forest @of, and it @ devour all @
round @+ it.

22:1 Thus @
 the LORD; Go down to the @ of the king of @,
and @K @ this word, 22:2 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O
king of @, that sittest upon the throne of @, thou, and thy
@<s, and thy @ that enter in by @ gates: 22:3 Thus @

the LORD; Execute ye judgment and @ceousness, and deliver the
spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no
violence to the stranger, the @less, nor the widow, @" shed
innocent @I in this @'.

22:4 For if ye do this @7 indeed, then @ @ enter in by the
gates of this @ kings sitting upon the throne of @, riding in
chariots and on horses, he, and his @<s, and his @.

22:5 But if ye will not hear @ @5, I swear by myself, @
 the
LORD, that this @ @ become a desolation.

22:6 For thus @
 the LORD unto the king's @ of @; Thou art
Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a
wilderness, and @G @ are not inhabited.

22:7 And I will prepare destroyers @
 thee, @ one with his
weapons: and they @ cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into
the fire.

22:8 And many nations @ pass by this city, and they @ say
@ man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto
this @ city?  22:9 Then they @ answer, Because they have
forsaken the covenant of the LORD @ God, and worshipped @C
gods, and served them.

22:10 Weep ye not for the dead, @" bemoan him: but weep sore for
him that goeth away: for he @ return no more, nor see his native
country.

22:11 For thus @
 the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king
of @, @ reigned instead of Josiah his @, @ went @
out of this @'; He @ not return thither any more: 22:12 But he
@ die in the @' whither they have led him captive, and @
see this land no more.

22:13 Woe unto him that buildeth his @ by un@ceousness, and his
chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service @S wages,
and giveth him not for his work; 22:14 That @
, I will build me a
wide @ and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is
cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.

22:15 Shalt thou reign, @ thou closest thyself in cedar? did not
thy @ eat and @b, and do judgment and justice, and then it was
well with him?  22:16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then
it was well with him: was not this to know me? @
 the LORD.

22:17 But @ eyes and @ @ are not but for thy covetousness,
and for to shed innocent @I, and for oppression, and for violence,
to do it.

22:18 @N thus @
 the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of @; They @ not lament for him, @, Ah my
@X! or, Ah sister! they @ not lament for him, @, Ah
lord! or, Ah his @Y!  22:19 He @ be buried with the burial of
an ass, drawn and cast @ beyond the gates of @ .

22:20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy @; in Bashan, and
cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

22:21 I @0 unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not
hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not
my @;.

22:22 The wind @ eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers @ go
into captivity: surely then @ thou be ashamed and con@Ved for
all thy wickedness.

22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
gracious @ thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a
woman in travail!  22:24 As I live, @
 the LORD, though Coniah the
son of Jehoiakim king of @ were the signet upon my @c hand, yet
@L I pluck thee thence; 22:25 And I will give thee into the hand of
them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou
fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and
into the hand of the Chaldeans.

22:26 And I will cast thee out, and thy m@C that bare thee, into
@F country, where ye were not born; and @ @ ye die.

22:27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither @
they not return.

22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel
wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed,
and are cast into a land @ they know not?  22:29 O @, @,
@, hear the word of the LORD.

22:30 Thus @
 the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
@ not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed @ prosper,
sitting upon the throne of @, and ruling any more in @.

23:1 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
pasture! @
 the LORD.

23:2 @N thus @
 the LORD God of @ @
 the pastors
that feed my @; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away,
and have not visited them: @%, I will visit upon you the evil of
your doings, @
 the LORD.

23:3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
whither I have driven them, and will @( them @* to @ folds;
and they @ be fruitful and increase.

23:4 And I will set up shepherds over them @ @ feed them: and
they @ fear no more, nor be dismayed, @" @ they be

 the LORD.

23:5 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will raise unto
@ a @ceous Branch, and a King @ reign and prosper, and
@ execute judgment and justice in the @.

23:6 In his days @ @ be saved, and @ @ dwell safely:
and this is his name whereby he @ be @,, THE LORD OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS.

23:7 @N, @%, the days come, @
 the LORD, that they @
no more say, The LORD liveth, @ @ up the @ of @
out of the land of @-; 23:8 But, The LORD liveth, @ @ up
and @ led the seed of the @ of @ out of the north
country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they
@ dwell in @ own land.

23:9 Mine @ within me is broken @ of the prophets; all my
bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath
overcome, @ of the LORD, and @ of the @5 of his
holiness.

23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; for @ of swearing the
land mourneth; the pleasant @'s of the wilderness are dried up, and
@ course is evil, and @ force is not @c.

23:11 For both prophet and @6 are profane; yea, in my @ have I
@V @ wickedness, @
 the LORD.

23:12 Wherefore @ way @ be unto them as slippery ways in the
darkness: they @ be driven on, and fall @in: for I will @(
evil upon them, even the year of @ visitation, @
 the LORD.

23:13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
prophesied in Baal, and caused my @ @ to err.

23:14 I have seen also in the prophets of @  an horrible @7:
they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the @D
of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all
of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants @of as Gomorrah.

23:15 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
@., I will feed them with wormwood, and make them @b the @Z
of gall: for from the prophets of @  is profaneness gone @
into all the land.

23:16 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the @5 of the
prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they @K a
vision of @ own @, and not out of the @P of the LORD.

23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
@ have @U; and they say unto @ one that walketh @ the
imagination of his own @, No evil @ come upon you.

23:18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
perceived and @) his word? who hath marked his word, and @) it?
23:19 @., a whirlwind of the LORD is gone @ in fury, even a
grievous whirlwind: it @ fall grievously upon the head of the
wicked.

23:20 The anger of the LORD @ not return, until he have executed,
and till he have performed the thoughts of his @: in the latter
days ye @ consider it perfectly.

23:21 I have not sent @ prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
to them, yet they prophesied.

23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my @ to
hear my @5, then they @# have turned them from @ evil way,
and from the evil of @ doings.

23:23 Am I a God at hand, @
 the LORD, and not a God afar off?
23:24 Can any hide @9 in secret @'s that I @ not see him?
@
 the LORD. Do not I fill @1 and @? @
 the LORD.

23:25 I have @) what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
name, @, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

23:26 How long @ this be in the @ of the prophets that
prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of @ own
@; 23:27 Which think to cause my @ to forget my name by @
dreams @ they tell @ man to his neighbour, as @ @s
have forgotten my name for Baal.

23:28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that
hath my word, let him @K my word faithfully. What is the chaff to
the wheat? @
 the LORD.

23:29 Is not my word like as a fire? @
 the LORD; and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces?  23:30 @N, @%, I am
@
 the prophets, @
 the LORD, that steal my @5 @ one
from his neighbour.

23:31 @., I am @
 the prophets, @
 the LORD, that use
@ tongues, and say, He @
.

23:32 @., I am @
 them that prophesy false dreams, @
 the
LORD, and do tell them, and cause my @ to err by @ lies, and
by @ lightness; yet I sent them not, nor @M them: @fore
they @ not profit this @ at all, @
 the LORD.

23:33 And when this @, or the prophet, or a @6, @ ask
thee, @, What is the burden of the LORD? thou @ then say unto
them, What burden? I will even forsake you, @
 the LORD.

23:34 And as for the prophet, and the @6, and the @, that
@ say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his
@.

23:35 Thus @ ye say @ one to his neighbour, and @ one to
his @X, What hath the LORD @>? and, What hath the LORD
spoken?  23:36 And the burden of the LORD @ ye mention no more:
for @ man's word @ be his burden; for ye have perverted the
@5 of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

23:37 Thus @ thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD @>
thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?  23:38 But since ye say, The
burden of the LORD; @fore thus @
 the LORD; Because ye say this
word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, @, Ye
@ not say, The burden of the LORD; 23:39 @N, @%, I,
even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city
that I gave you and your @s, and cast you out of my presence:
23:40 And I will @( an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
perpetual shame, @ @ not be forgotten.

24:1 The LORD shewed me, and, @%, two baskets of figs were set
@	 the temple of the LORD, @ that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
@, and the princes of @, with the carpenters and smiths, from
@ , and had @ them to Babylon.

24:2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are @O
ripe: and the @C basket had very naughty figs, @ could not be
eaten, they were so bad.

24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that
cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 24:5 Thus @

the LORD, the God of @; Like @ good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of @, whom I have
sent out of this @' into the land of the Chaldeans for @ good.

24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will @(
them @* to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them
down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.

24:7 And I will give them an @ to know me, that I am the LORD: and
they @ be my @, and I will be @ God: for they @
return unto me with @ whole @.

24:8 And as the evil figs, @ cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
surely thus @
 the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of @,
and his princes, and the residue of @ , that remain in this
land, and them that dwell in the land of @-: 24:9 And I will
deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the @ for
@ hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in
all @'s whither I @ drive them.

24:10 And I will send the @Q, the famine, and the pestilence, @
them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them
and to @ @s.

25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the @ of @
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of @, that
was the @O year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 25:2 The @
Jeremiah the prophet @0 unto all the @ of @, and to all
the inhabitants of @ , @, 25:3 From the thirteenth year of
Josiah the son of Amon king of @, even unto this day, that is the
@@ and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and
I have spoken unto you, rising early and @King; but ye have not
hearkened.

25:4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his @<s the prophets,
rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined
your ear to hear.

25:5 They said, Turn ye @* now @ one from his evil way, and
from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath
@= unto you and to your @s for ever and ever: 25:6 And go not
@ @C gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me
not to anger with the works of your @D; and I will do you no hurt.

25:7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, @
 the LORD; that ye @B
provoke me to anger with the works of your @D to your own hurt.

25:8 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not @)
my @5, 25:9 @., I will send and take all the families of the
north, @
 the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
@<, and will @( them @
 this land, and @
 the
inhabitants @of, and @
 all @ nations round @+, and
will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an
hissing, and perpetual desolations.

25:10 Moreover I will take from them the @; of mirth, and the @;
of gladness, the @; of the bridegroom, and the @; of the bride,
the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.

25:11 And this whole land @ be a desolation, and an astonishment;
and @ nations @ serve the king of Babylon @Hty @8.

25:12 And it @ come to pass, when @Hty @8 are accomplished,
that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, @
 the
LORD, for @ iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make
it perpetual desolations.

25:13 And I will @( upon that land all my @5 @ I have
pronounced @
 it, even all that is written in this book, @
Jeremiah hath prophesied @
 all the nations.

25:14 For many nations and @ kings @ serve @T of them
also: and I will recompense them @$ to @ deeds, and
@$ to the works of @ own @D.

25:15 For thus @
 the LORD God of @ unto me; Take the wine cup
of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send
thee, to @b it.

25:16 And they @ @b, and be moved, and be mad, @ of the
@Q that I will send @ them.

25:17 Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations
to @b, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 25:18 To wit, @ , and
the @G of @, and the kings @of, and the princes @of,
to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse;
as it is this day; 25:19 Pharaoh king of @-, and his @<s, and
his princes, and all his @; 25:20 And all the mingled @, and
all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the
Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of
Ashdod, 25:21 Edom, and Moab, and the @ of Ammon, 25:22 And all
the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the
isles @ are beyond the sea, 25:23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and
all that are in the utmost corners, 25:24 And all the kings of Arabia,
and all the kings of the mingled @ that dwell in the desert,
25:25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
the kings of the Medes, 25:26 And all the kings of the north, far and
near, one with @F, and all the kingdoms of the world, @ are
upon the face of the @: and the king of Sheshach @ @b @
them.

25:27 @N thou @ say unto them, Thus @
 the LORD of
hosts, the God of @; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and
fall, and rise no more, @ of the @Q @ I will send @
you.

25:28 And it @ be, if they refuse to take the cup at @ hand to
@b, then @ thou say unto them, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Ye
@ certainly @b.

25:29 For, lo, I begin to @( evil on the city @ is @, by my
name, and @# ye be utterly unpunished? Ye @ not be unpunished:
for I will call for a @Q upon all the inhabitants of the @,
@
 the LORD of hosts.

25:30 @N prophesy thou @
 them all @ @5, and say
unto them, The LORD @ roar from on high, and utter his @; from
his holy habitation; he @ @Bily roar upon his habitation; he
@ give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, @
 all the
inhabitants of the @.

25:31 A noise @ come even to the ends of the @; for the LORD
hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all @R; he
will give them that are wicked to the @Q, @
 the LORD.

25:32 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, @., evil @ go @ from
nation to nation, and a @ whirlwind @ be raised up from the
coasts of the @.

25:33 And the slain of the LORD @ be at that day from one end of
the @ even unto the @C end of the @: they @ not be
lamented, @" ga@d, nor buried; they @ be dung upon the
ground.

25:34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,
ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your
dispersions are accomplished; and ye @ fall like a pleasant
vessel.

25:35 And the shepherds @ have no way to flee, nor the principal
of the flock to escape.

25:36 A @; of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
principal of the flock, @ be @): for the LORD hath spoiled
@ pasture.

25:37 And the @Uable habitations are cut down @ of the fierce
anger of the LORD.

25:38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for @ land is
desolate @ of the fierceness of the oppressor, and @ of
his fierce anger.

26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of @ came this word from the LORD, @, 26:2 Thus @
 the
LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's @, and @K unto all the
@G of @, @ come to worship in the LORD's @, all the
@5 that I command thee to @K unto them; diminish not a word:
26:3 If so be they will hearken, and turn @ man from his evil way,
that I may repent me of the evil, @ I purpose to do unto them
@ of the evil of @ doings.

26:4 And thou @ say unto them, Thus @
 the LORD; If ye will not
hearken to me, to walk in my law, @ I have set @	 you, 26:5 To
hearken to the @5 of my @<s the prophets, whom I sent unto
you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not
hearkened; 26:6 Then will I make this @ like Shiloh, and will make
this city a curse to all the nations of the @.

26:7 So the @6s and the prophets and all the @ @) Jeremiah
@King @ @5 in the @ of the LORD.

26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of @King
all that the LORD had @M him to @K unto all the @, that
the @6s and the prophets and all the @ took him, @, Thou
@ surely die.

26:9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, @, This
@ @ be like Shiloh, and this city @ be desolate @S an
inhabitant?  And all the @ were ga@d @
 Jeremiah in the
@ of the LORD.

26:10 When the princes of @ @) @ @, then they came up
from the king's @ unto the @ of the LORD, and sat down in the
entry of the new gate of the LORD's @.

26:11 Then @0 the @6s and the prophets unto the princes and to
all the @, @, This man is worthy to die; for he hath
prophesied @
 this city, as ye have @) with your ears.

26:12 Then @0 Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the @,
@, The LORD sent me to prophesy @
 this @ and @

this city all the @5 that ye have @).

26:13 @N now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
@; of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil
that he hath pronounced @
 you.

26:14 As for me, @%, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good
and meet unto you.

26:15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to @^, ye @
surely @( innocent @I upon yourselves, and upon this city, and
upon the inhabitants @of: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me
unto you to @K all @ @5 in your ears.

26:16 Then said the princes and all the @ unto the @6s and to
the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us
in the name of the LORD our God.

26:17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and @0 to all
the assembly of the @, @, 26:18 Micah the Morasthite
prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of @, and @0 to all the
@ of @, @, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Zion @ be
plowed like a field, and @  @ become heaps, and the
mountain of the @ as the high @'s of a forest.

26:19 Did Hezekiah king of @ and all @ put him at all to
@^?  did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD
repented him of the evil @ he had pronounced @
 them? Thus
@B we procure @ evil @
 our souls.

26:20 And @ was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied
@
 this city and @
 this land @$ to all the @5 of
Jeremiah.

26:21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his @By men, and all
the princes, @) his @5, the king sought to put him to @^: but
when Urijah @) it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into @-;
26:22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into @-, namely, Elnathan the
son of Achbor, and certain men with him into @-.

26:23 And they fetched @ Urijah out of @-, and @ him unto
Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the @Q, and cast his dead
body into the graves of the common @.

26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
Jeremiah, that they @# not give him into the hand of the @ to
put him to @^.

27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of @ came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, @, 27:2 Thus
@
 the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy
neck, 27:3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the
king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers @ come to @ 
unto Zedekiah king of @; 27:4 And command them to say unto @
masters, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Thus @
ye say unto your masters; 27:5 I have made the @, the man and the
beast that are upon the ground, by my @ power and by my
outstretched arm, and have @= it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.

27:6 And now have I @= all @ lands into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my @<; and the beasts of the
field have I @= him also to serve him.

27:7 And all nations @ serve him, and his son, and his son's son,
until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and @
kings @ serve @T of him.

27:8 And it @ come to pass, that the nation and kingdom @ will
not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will
not put @ neck @[ the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation
will I punish, @
 the LORD, with the @Q, and with the famine,
and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.

27:9 @N hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,
@ @K unto you, @, Ye @ not serve the king of Babylon:
27:10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
land; and that I @# drive you out, and ye @# perish.

27:11 But the nations that @( @ neck @[ the yoke of the king
of Babylon, and serve him, @J will I let remain still in @ own
land, @
 the LORD; and they @ till it, and dwell @in.

27:12 I @0 also to Zedekiah king of @ @$ to all @
@5, @, Bring your necks @[ the yoke of the king of Babylon,
and serve him and his @, and live.

27:13 Why will ye die, thou and thy @, by the @Q, by the
famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken @
 the
nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?  27:14 @N
hearken not unto the @5 of the prophets that @K unto you,
@, Ye @ not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a
lie unto you.

27:15 For I have not sent them, @
 the LORD, yet they prophesy a
lie in my name; that I @B drive you out, and that ye @B perish,
ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.

27:16 Also I @0 to the @6s and to all this @, @, Thus
@
 the LORD; Hearken not to the @5 of your prophets that
prophesy unto you, @, @., the vessels of the LORD's @
@ now shortly be @ @* from Babylon: for they prophesy a
lie unto you.

27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
wherefore @# this city be laid waste?  27:18 But if they be
prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make
intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels @ are left in
the @ of the LORD, and in the @ of the king of @, and at
@ , go not to Babylon.

27:19 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the
residue of the vessels that remain in this city.

27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of @ from
@  to Babylon, and all the nobles of @ and @ ; 27:21
Yea, thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @, concerning the
vessels that remain in the @ of the LORD, and in the @ of the
king of @ and of @ ; 27:22 They @ be carried to
Babylon, and @ @ they be until the day that I visit them,
@
 the LORD; then will I @( them up, and restore them to this
@'.

28:1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign
of Zedekiah king of @, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month,
that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, @ was of Gibeon, @0
unto me in the @ of the LORD, in the presence of the @6s and
of all the @, @, 28:2 Thus @Keth the LORD of hosts, the
God of @, @, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

28:3 Within two full @8 will I @( @* into this @' all the
vessels of the LORD's @, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took
away from this @', and carried them to Babylon: 28:4 And I will
@( @* to this @' Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of @,
with all the captives of @, that went into Babylon, @
 the
LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
presence of the @6s, and in the presence of all the @ that
stood in the @ of the LORD, 28:6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said,
Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy @5 @ thou hast
prophesied, to @( @* the vessels of the LORD's @, and all
that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this @'.

28:7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I @K in @ ears,
and in the ears of all the @; 28:8 The prophets that have been
@	 me and @	 thee of old prophesied both @
 many
countries, and @
 @ kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of
pestilence.

28:9 The prophet @ prophesieth of @U, when the word of the
prophet @ come to pass, then @ the prophet be known, that the
LORD hath truly sent him.

28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

28:11 And Hananiah @0 in the presence of all the @, @,
Thus @
 the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two
full @8. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

28:12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, @
that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the
prophet Jeremiah, @, 28:13 Go and tell Hananiah, @, Thus
@
 the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou @
make for them yokes of iron.

28:14 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; I have put
a yoke of iron upon the neck of all @ nations, that they may serve
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they @ serve him: and I have
@= him the beasts of the field also.

28:15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this
@ to trust in a lie.

28:16 @N thus @
 the LORD; @., I will cast thee from off
the face of the @: this year thou @ die, @ thou hast
taught rebellion @
 the LORD.

28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the @Hth month.

29:1 Now @ are the @5 of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
sent from @  unto the residue of the elders @ were carried
away captives, and to the @6s, and to the prophets, and to all the
@ whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from @  to
Babylon; 29:2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the
eunuchs, the princes of @ and @ , and the carpenters, and
the smiths, were departed from @ ;) 29:3 By the hand of Elasah
the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah
king of @ sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)
@, 29:4 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @, unto all
that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away
from @  unto Babylon; 29:5 Build ye @s, and dwell in them;
and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 29:6 Take ye wives, and
beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your
daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye
may be increased @, and not diminished.

29:7 And seek the @U of the city whither I have caused you to be
carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the @U
@of @ ye have @U.

29:8 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Let not your
prophets and your diviners, that be in the @a of you, deceive you,
@" hearken to your dreams @ ye cause to be dreamed.

29:9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
them, @
 the LORD.

29:10 For thus @
 the LORD, That @ @Hty @8 be
accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word
toward you, in causing you to return to this @'.

29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, @
 the LORD,
thoughts of @U, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

29:12 Then @ ye call upon me, and ye @ go and pray unto me,
and I will hearken unto you.

29:13 And ye @ seek me, and find me, when ye @ search for me
with all your @.

29:14 And I will be @V of you, @
 the LORD: and I will turn away
your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from
all the @'s whither I have driven you, @
 the LORD; and I will
@( you @* into the @' whence I caused you to be carried away
captive.

29:15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
Babylon; 29:16 Know that thus @
 the LORD of the king that sitteth
upon the throne of @, and of all the @ that dwelleth in this
city, and of your @3 that are not gone @ with you into
captivity; 29:17 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; @., I will send
upon them the @Q, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make
them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

29:18 And I will persecute them with the @Q, with the famine, and
with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the
kingdoms of the @, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an
hissing, and a reproach, @ all the nations whither I have driven
them: 29:19 Because they have not hearkened to my @5, @
 the
LORD, @ I sent unto them by my @<s the prophets, rising up
early and sending them; but ye @L not hear, @
 the LORD.

29:20 Hear ye @fore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,
whom I have sent from @  to Babylon: 29:21 Thus @
 the LORD
of hosts, the God of @, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of
Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, @ prophesy a lie unto you in my
name; @., I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon; and he @ slay them @	 your eyes; 29:22 And of them
@ be taken up a curse by all the captivity of @ @ are in
Babylon, @, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom
the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 29:23 Because they have
committed villany in @, and have committed adultery with @
neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying @5 in my name, @ I
have not @M them; even I know, and am a witness, @
 the
LORD.

29:24 Thus @ thou also @K to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, @,
29:25 Thus @Keth the LORD of hosts, the God of @, @,
Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the @ that
are at @ , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the @6, and
to all the @6s, @, 29:26 The LORD hath made thee @6 in
the stead of Jehoiada the @6, that ye @# be officers in the
@ of the LORD, for @ man that is mad, and maketh @9 a
prophet, that thou @#est put him in prison, and in the stocks.

29:27 Now @fore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
@ maketh @9 a prophet to you?  29:28 For @fore he sent
unto us in Babylon, @, This captivity is long: build ye @s,
and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

29:29 And Zephaniah the @6 read this letter in the ears of
Jeremiah the prophet.

29:30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, @, 29:31 Send
to all them of the captivity, @, Thus @
 the LORD concerning
Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto
you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 29:32
@N thus @
 the LORD; @., I will punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite, and his seed: he @ not have a man to dwell @ this
@; @" @ he @% the good that I will do for my @,
@
 the LORD; @ he hath taught rebellion @
 the LORD.

30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, @, 30:2 Thus
@Keth the LORD God of @, @, Write thee all the @5 that
I have spoken unto thee in a book.

30:3 For, lo, the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will @( @*
the captivity of my @ @ and @, @
 the LORD: and I
will cause them to return to the land that I gave to @ @s,
and they @ possess it.

30:4 And @ are the @5 that the LORD @0 concerning @ and
concerning @.

30:5 For thus @
 the LORD; We have @) a @; of trembling, of
fear, and not of @U.

30:6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
wherefore do I see @ man with his @D on his loins, as a woman
in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  30:7 Alas! for
that day is @, so that none is like it: it is even the time of
@]'s trouble, but he @ be saved out of it.

30:8 For it @ come to pass in that day, @
 the LORD of hosts,
that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy
bonds, and strangers @ no more serve @T of him: 30:9 But
they @ serve the LORD @ God, and @ @ king, whom I will
raise up unto them.

30:10 @N fear thou not, O my @< @], @
 the LORD;
@" be dismayed, O @: for, lo, I will save thee from afar,
and thy seed from the land of @ captivity; and @] @ return,
and @ be in rest, and be quiet, and none @ make him afraid.

30:11 For I am with thee, @
 the LORD, to save thee: though I make
a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will
not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and
will not leave thee al@? unpunished.

30:12 For thus @
 the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound
is grievous.

30:13 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:
thou hast no healing medicines.

30:14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of
a cruel one, for the multitude of @ iniquity; @ thy sins
were increased.

30:15 Why criest thou for @ affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
for the multitude of @ iniquity: @ thy sins were increased,
I have done @ @ unto thee.

30:16 @N all they that devour thee @ be devoured; and all
@ adversaries, @ one of them, @ go into captivity; and
they that spoil thee @ be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee
will I give for a prey.

30:17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy
wounds, @
 the LORD; @ they @, thee an Outcast, @,
This is Zion, whom no man seeketh @.

30:18 Thus @
 the LORD; @., I will @( @* the captivity of
@]'s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling@'s; and the city
@ be builded upon her own heap, and the palace @ remain @
the manner @of.

30:19 And out of them @ proceed thanksgiving and the @; of them
that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they @ not be few;
I will also glorify them, and they @ not be small.

30:20 Their @ also @ be as aforetime, and @
@` @ be established @	 me, and I will punish all
that oppress them.

30:21 And @ nobles @ be of @T, and @ governor
@ proceed from the @a of them; and I will cause him to draw
near, and he @ approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his
@ to approach unto me? @
 the LORD.

30:22 And ye @ be my @, and I will be your God.

30:23 @., the whirlwind of the LORD goeth @ with fury, a
continuing whirlwind: it @ fall with pain upon the head of the
wicked.

30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD @ not return, until he hath
done it, and until he have performed the intents of his @: in the
latter days ye @ consider it.

31:1 At the same time, @
 the LORD, will I be the God of all the
families of @, and they @ be my @.

31:2 Thus @
 the LORD, The @ @ were left of the @Q
@V grace in the wilderness; even @, when I went to cause him
to rest.

31:3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, @, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: @fore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee.

31:4 Again I will build thee, and thou @ be built, O virgin of
@: thou @ @* be adorned with thy tabrets, and @ go
@ in the dances of them that make merry.

31:5 Thou @ yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
planters @ plant, and @ eat them as common @.

31:6 For @ @ be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
Ephraim @ cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD
our God.

31:7 For thus @
 the LORD; Sing with gladness for @], and shout
@ the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O
LORD, save thy @, the remnant of @.

31:8 @., I will @( them from the north country, and gather them
from the coasts of the @, and with them the blind and the lame,
the woman with child and her that travaileth with child @?: a
@ company @ return thither.

31:9 They @ come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of @Zs in a straight
way, wherein they @ not stumble: for I am a @ to @, and
Ephraim is my @Oborn.

31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
isles afar off, and say, He that scattered @ will gather him, and
keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

31:11 For the LORD hath redeemed @], and ransomed him from the hand
of him that was stronger than he.

31:12 @N they @ come and sing in the height of Zion, and
@ flow @? to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for
wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and
@ soul @ be as a @Zed garden; and they @ not sorrow any
more at all.

31:13 Then @ the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
old @?: for I will turn @ mourning into joy, and will
comfort them, and make them rejoice from @ sorrow.

31:14 And I will satiate the soul of the @6s with fatness, and my
@ @ be satisfied with my goodness, @
 the LORD.

31:15 Thus @
 the LORD; A @; was @) in Ramah, lamentation,
and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her @ refused to be
comforted for her @, @ they were not.

31:16 Thus @
 the LORD; Refrain thy @; from weeping, and @
eyes from tears: for thy work @ be rewarded, @
 the LORD; and
they @ come @* from the land of the enemy.

31:17 And @ is hope in @ end, @
 the LORD, that thy
@ @ come @* to @ own border.

31:18 I have surely @) Ephraim bemoaning @9 thus; Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke: turn thou me, and I @ be turned; for thou art the LORD my
God.

31:19 Surely @ that I was turned, I repented; and @ that I was
instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even
con@Ved, @ I did bear the reproach of my youth.

31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
@0 @
 him, I do earnestly remember him still: @fore my
bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, @

the LORD.

31:21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set @ @
toward the highway, even the way @ thou wentest: turn @*, O
virgin of @, turn @* to @ thy @G.

31:22 How long wilt thou go @+, O thou backsliding daughter? for
the LORD hath created a new @7 in the @, A woman @ compass
a man.

31:23 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; As yet they
@ use this speech in the land of @ and in the @G @of,
when I @ @( @* @ captivity; The LORD bless thee, O
habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.

31:24 And @ @ dwell in @ itself, and in all the @G
@of @?, husbandmen, and they that go @ with flocks.

31:25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished @
sorrowful soul.

31:26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.

31:27 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will sow the @
of @ and the @ of @ with the seed of man, and with the
seed of beast.

31:28 And it @ come to pass, that like as I have watched over
them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to
destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to
plant, @
 the LORD.

31:29 In @J days they @ say no more, The @s have eaten a
sour grape, and the @'s teeth are set on edge.

31:30 But @ one @ die for his own iniquity: @ man that
eateth the sour grape, his teeth @ be set on edge.

31:31 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will make a new
covenant with the @ of @, and with the @ of @: 31:32
Not @$ to the covenant that I made with @ @s in the
day that I took them by the hand to @( them out of the land of
@-; @ my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto
them, @
 the LORD: 31:33 But this @ be the covenant that I will
make with the @ of @; After @J days, @
 the LORD, I
will put my law in @ inward parts, and write it in @ @s;
and will be @ God, and they @ be my @.

31:34 And they @ teach no more @ man his neighbour, and @
man his @X, @, Know the LORD: for they @ all know me,
from the least of them unto the @est of them, @
 the LORD: for
I will forgive @ iniquity, and I will remember @ sin no more.

31:35 Thus @
 the LORD, @ giveth the sun for a light by day,
and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
@ divideth the sea when the waves @of roar; The LORD of hosts
is his name: 31:36 If @J ordinances depart from @	 me, @

the LORD, then the seed of @ also @ cease from being a nation
@	 me for ever.

31:37 Thus @
 the LORD; If @1 above can be measured, and the
@Vations of the @ searched out beneath, I will also cast off
all the seed of @ for all that they have done, @
 the LORD.

31:38 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that the city @ be
built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the
corner.

31:39 And the measuring line @ yet go @ over @
 it upon
the hill Gareb, and @ compass @+ to Goath.

31:40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse
gate toward the east, @ be holy unto the LORD; it @ not be
plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
Zedekiah king of @, @ was the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadrezzar.

32:2 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged @ : and
Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, @ was
in the king of @'s @.

32:3 For Zedekiah king of @ had shut him up, @, Wherefore
dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus @
 the LORD, @., I will give
this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he @ take it;
32:4 And Zedekiah king of @ @ not escape out of the hand of
the Chaldeans, but @ surely be delivered into the hand of the king
of Babylon, and @ @K with him @P to @P, and his eyes
@ @% his eyes; 32:5 And he @ lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and
@ @ he be until I visit him, @
 the LORD: though ye fight
with the Chaldeans, ye @ not prosper.

32:6 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, @,
32:7 @., Hanameel the son of Shallum @ uncle @ come unto
thee @, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the @c of
redemption is @ to buy it.

32:8 So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the
prison @$ to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my
field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, @ is in the country of
Benjamin: for the @c of inheritance is @, and the redemption is
@; buy it for thyself.

Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.

32:9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in
Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even @Hteen shekels of silver.

32:10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

32:11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that @ was
sealed @$ to the law and custom, and that @ was open: 32:12
And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in
the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the
purchase, @	 all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.

32:13 And I charged Baruch @	 them, @, 32:14 Thus @
 the
LORD of hosts, the God of @; Take @ evidences, this evidence
of the purchase, both @ is sealed, and this evidence @ is
open; and put them in an @en vessel, that they may continue many
days.

32:15 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Houses and
fields and vineyards @ be possessed @* in this land.

32:16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, @, 32:17 Ah
Lord GOD! @%, thou hast made the @1 and the @ by thy @
power and stretched out arm, and @ is no@7 too hard for thee:
32:18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto @:s, and recompensest the
iniquity of the @s into the bosom of @ @ @ them:
the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, 32:19 Great
in counsel, and @By in work: for @ eyes are open upon all the
ways of the sons of men: to give @ one @$ to his ways, and
@$ to the fruit of his doings: 32:20 Which hast set signs and
wonders in the land of @-, even unto this day, and in @, and
@ @C men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; 32:21 And
hast @ @ thy @ @ out of the land of @- with
signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched
out arm, and with @ terror; 32:22 And hast @= them this land,
@ thou didst swear to @ @s to give them, a land flowing
with milk and honey; 32:23 And they came in, and possessed it; but
they obeyed not thy @;, @" walked in thy law; they have done
no@7 of all that thou @Mst them to do: @fore thou hast
caused all this evil to come upon them: 32:24 @. the mounts, they
are come unto the city to take it; and the city is @= into the hand
of the Chaldeans, that fight @
 it, @ of the @Q, and of
the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come
to pass; and, @%, thou seest it.

32:25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
money, and take witnesses; for the city is @= into the hand of the
Chaldeans.

32:26 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, @, 32:27
@., I am the LORD, the God of all @R: is @ any @7 too
hard for me?  32:28 @N thus @
 the LORD; @., I will give
this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he @ take it: 32:29 And the
Chaldeans, that fight @
 this city, @ come and set fire on
this city, and burn it with the @s, upon whose roofs they have
offered incense unto Baal, and poured out @b @&s unto @C
gods, to provoke me to anger.

32:30 For the @ of @ and the @ of @ have only
done evil @	 me from @ youth: for the @ of @ have
only provoked me to anger with the work of @ @D, @
 the
LORD.

32:31 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and
of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I
@# remove it from @	 my face, 32:32 Because of all the evil of
the @ of @ and of the @ of @, @ they have
done to provoke me to anger, they, @ kings, @ princes, @
@6s, and @ prophets, and the men of @, and the inhabitants
of @ .

32:33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though
I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction.

32:34 But they set @ abominations in the @, @ is @, by
my name, to defile it.

32:35 And they built the high @'s of Baal, @ are in the valley
of the son of Hinnom, to cause @ sons and @ daughters to pass
@E the fire unto Molech; @ I @M them not, @" came
it into my mind, that they @# do this abomination, to cause @
to sin.

32:36 And now @fore thus @
 the LORD, the God of @,
concerning this city, whereof ye say, It @ be delivered into the
hand of the king of Babylon by the @Q, and by the famine, and by
the pestilence; 32:37 @., I will gather them out of all countries,
whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in @
wrath; and I will @( them @* unto this @', and I will cause
them to dwell safely: 32:38 And they @ be my @, and I will be
@ God: 32:39 And I will give them one @, and one way, that
they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of @ @
@ them: 32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them,
that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put
my fear in @ @s, that they @ not depart from me.

32:41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
them in this land assuredly with my whole @ and with my whole
soul.

32:42 For thus @
 the LORD; Like as I have @ all this @
evil upon this @, so will I @( upon them all the good that I
have promised them.

32:43 And fields @ be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
desolate @S man or beast; it is @= into the hand of the
Chaldeans.

32:44 Men @ buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the
@'s @+ @ , and in the @G of @, and in the @G
of the mountains, and in the @G of the valley, and in the @G
of the south: for I will cause @ captivity to return, @
 the
LORD.

33:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, @, 33:2 Thus
@
 the LORD the maker @of, the LORD that formed it, to
establish it; the LORD is his name; 33:3 Call unto me, and I will
answer thee, and shew thee @ and @By @, @ thou knowest
not.

33:4 For thus @
 the LORD, the God of @, concerning the @s
of this city, and concerning the @s of the kings of @, @
are thrown down by the mounts, and by the @Q; 33:5 They come to
fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies
of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all
whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.

33:6 @., I will @( it health and cure, and I will cure them,
and will reveal unto them the abundance of @U and truth.

33:7 And I will cause the captivity of @ and the captivity of
@ to return, and will build them, as at the @O.

33:8 And I will cleanse them from all @ iniquity, whereby they
have sinned @
 me; and I will pardon all @ iniquities,
whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed @

me.

33:9 And it @ be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
@	 all the nations of the @, @ @ hear all the good
that I do unto them: and they @ fear and tremble for all the
goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.

33:10 Thus @
 the LORD; Again @ @ be @) in this @',
@ ye say @ be desolate @S man and @S beast, even in
the @G of @, and in the streets of @ , that are
desolate, @S man, and @S inhabitant, and @S beast,
33:11 The @; of joy, and the @; of gladness, the @; of the
bridegroom, and the @; of the bride, the @; of them that @
say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy
endureth for ever: and of them that @ @( the sacrifice of
praise into the @ of the LORD. For I will cause to return the
captivity of the land, as at the @O, @
 the LORD.

33:12 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Again in this @', @ is
desolate @S man and @S beast, and in all the @G @of,
@ be an habitation of shepherds causing @ flocks to lie down.

33:13 In the @G of the mountains, in the @G of the vale, and
in the @G of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the
@'s @+ @ , and in the @G of @, @ the flocks
pass @* @[ the @D of him that telleth them, @
 the LORD.

33:14 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will perform that
good @7 @ I have promised unto the @ of @ and to the
@ of @.

33:15 In @J days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
@ceousness to grow up unto @; and he @ execute judgment and
@ceousness in the land.

33:16 In @J days @ @ be saved, and @  @ dwell
safely: and this is the name wherewith she @ be @,, The LORD
our @ceousness.

33:17 For thus @
 the LORD; @ @ never want a man to sit
upon the throne of the @ of @; 33:18 Neither @ the
@6s the Levites want a man @	 me to offer @_ @&s, and
to kindle meat @&s, and to do sacrifice continually.

33:19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, @, 33:20 Thus
@
 the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my
covenant of the night, and that @ @# not be day and night in
@ season; 33:21 Then may also my covenant be broken with @ my
@<, that he @# not have a son to reign upon his throne; and
with the Levites the @6s, my ministers.

33:22 As the host of @1 cannot be numbered, @" the sand of
the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of @ my @<, and
the Levites that minister unto me.

33:23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, @, 33:24
Considerest thou not what this @ have spoken, @, The two
families @ the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus
they have despised my @, that they @# be no more a nation
@	 them.

33:25 Thus @
 the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
and if I have not appointed the ordinances of @1 and @; 33:26
Then will I cast away the seed of @] and @ my @<, so that
I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham,
Isaac, and @]: for I will cause @ captivity to return, and have
mercy on them.

34:1 The word @ came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms
of the @ of his dominion, and all the @, fought @

@ , and @
 all the @G @of, @, 34:2 Thus @

the LORD, the God of @; Go and @K to Zedekiah king of @,
and tell him, Thus @
 the LORD; @., I will give this city into
the hand of the king of Babylon, and he @ burn it with fire: 34:3
And thou @ not escape out of his hand, but @ surely be taken,
and delivered into his hand; and @ eyes @ @% the eyes of
the king of Babylon, and he @ @K with thee @P to @P, and
thou @ go to Babylon.

34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of @; Thus
@
 the LORD of thee, Thou @ not die by the @Q: 34:5 But thou
@ die in @U: and with the burnings of thy @s, the former
kings @ were @	 thee, so @ they burn odours for thee; and
they will lament thee, @, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the
word, @
 the LORD.

34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet @0 all @ @5 unto Zedekiah
king of @ in @ , 34:7 When the king of Babylon's army
fought @
 @ , and @
 all the @G of @ that
were left, @
 Lachish, and @
 Azekah: for @ defenced
@G remained of the @G of @.

34:8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, @
that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the @ @
were at @ , to proclaim liberty unto them; 34:9 That @ man
@# let his man@<, and @ man his maid@<, being an
Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none @# serve @9 of
them, to wit, of a Jew his @X.

34:10 Now when all the princes, and all the @, @ had entered
into the covenant, @) that @ one @# let his man@<, and
@ one his maid@<, go free, that none @# serve @T
of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.

34:11 But @ward they turned, and caused the @<s and the
handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and @ them into
subjection for @<s and for handmaids.

34:12 @N the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
@, 34:13 Thus @
 the LORD, the God of @; I made a
covenant with your @s in the day that I @ them @ out of
the land of @-, out of the @ of bondmen, @, 34:14 At the
end of @H @8 let ye go @ man his @X an Hebrew, @
hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six @8, thou
@ let him go free from thee: but your @s hearkened not unto
me, @" inclined @ ear.

34:15 And ye were now turned, and had done @c in my sight, in
proclaiming liberty @ man to his neighbour; and ye had made a
covenant @	 me in the @ @ is @, by my name: 34:16 But
ye turned and polluted my name, and caused @ man his @<, and
@ man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at @ pleasure,
to return, and @ them into subjection, to be unto you for
@<s and for handmaids.

34:17 @N thus @
 the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
proclaiming liberty, @ one to his @X, and @ man to his
neighbour: @%, I proclaim a liberty for you, @
 the LORD, to
the @Q, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you
to be removed into all the kingdoms of the @.

34:18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
@ have not performed the @5 of the covenant @ they had made
@	 me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the
parts @of, 34:19 The princes of @, and the princes of
@ , the eunuchs, and the @6s, and all the @ of the
land, @ passed between the parts of the calf; 34:20 I will even
give them into the hand of @ enemies, and into the hand of them
that seek @ life: and @ dead bodies @ be for meat unto the
fowls of the @1, and to the beasts of the @.

34:21 And Zedekiah king of @ and his princes will I give into the
hand of @ enemies, and into the hand of them that seek @ life,
and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, @ are gone up
from you.

34:22 @., I will command, @
 the LORD, and cause them to return
to this city; and they @ fight @
 it, and take it, and burn
it with fire: and I will make the @G of @ a desolation @S
an inhabitant.

35:1 The word @ came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of @, @, 35:2 Go unto the
@ of the Rechabites, and @K unto them, and @( them into the
@ of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to
@b.

35:3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
and his @3, and all his sons, and the whole @ of the
Rechabites; 35:4 And I @ them into the @ of the LORD, into
the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God,
@ was by the chamber of the princes, @ was above the chamber
of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 35:5 And I set
@	 the sons of the @ of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and
cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

35:6 But they said, We will @b no wine: for Jonadab the son of
Rechab our @ @M us, @, Ye @ @b no wine,
@" ye, nor your sons for ever: 35:7 Neither @ ye build @,
nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye
@ dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye
be strangers.

35:8 Thus have we obeyed the @; of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
@ in all that he hath charged us, to @b no wine all our days,
we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 35:9 Nor to build @s
for us to dwell in: @" have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
35:10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done @$
to all that Jonadab our @ @M us.

35:11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to @  for fear
of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians:
so we dwell at @ .

35:12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, @, 35:13 Thus
@
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Go and tell the men of
@ and the inhabitants of @ , Will ye not receive
instruction to hearken to my @5? @
 the LORD.

35:14 The @5 of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he @M his
sons not to @b wine, are performed; for unto this day they @b
none, but obey @ @'s commandment: notwithstanding I have
spoken unto you, rising early and @King; but ye hearkened not unto
me.

35:15 I have sent also unto you all my @<s the prophets, rising
up early and sending them, @, Return ye now @ man from his
evil way, and amend your doings, and go not @ @C gods to serve
them, and ye @ dwell in the land @ I have @= to you and to
your @s: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto
me.

35:16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
commandment of @ @, @ he @M them; but this @
hath not hearkened unto me: 35:17 @N thus @
 the LORD God of
hosts, the God of @; @., I will @( upon @ and upon all
the inhabitants of @  all the evil that I have pronounced
@
 them: @ I have spoken unto them, but they have not
@); and I have @, unto them, but they have not @>.

35:18 And Jeremiah said unto the @ of the Rechabites, Thus @

the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Because ye have obeyed the
commandment of Jonadab your @, and kept all his precepts, and
done @$ unto all that he hath @M you: 35:19 @N
thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Jonadab the son of
Rechab @ not want a man to stand @	 me for ever.

36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of @, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
@, 36:2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write @in all the
@5 that I have spoken unto thee @
 @, and @
 @,
and @
 all the nations, from the day I @0 unto thee, from the
days of Josiah, even unto this day.

36:3 It may be that the @ of @ will hear all the evil @ I
purpose to do unto them; that they may return @ man from his evil
way; that I may forgive @ iniquity and @ sin.

36:4 Then Jeremiah @, Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
from the @P of Jeremiah all the @5 of the LORD, @ he had
spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

36:5 And Jeremiah @M Baruch, @, I am shut up; I cannot go
into the @ of the LORD: 36:6 @N go thou, and read in the
roll, @ thou hast written from my @P, the @5 of the LORD in
the ears of the @ in the LORD's @ upon the fasting day: and
also thou @ read them in the ears of all @ that come out of
@ @G.

36:7 It may be they will present @ supplication @	 the LORD,
and will return @ one from his evil way: for @ is the anger
and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced @
 this @.

36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did @$ to all that Jeremiah
the prophet @M him, reading in the book the @5 of the LORD
in the LORD's @.

36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of @, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast
@	 the LORD to all the @ in @ , and to all the @
that came from the @G of @ unto @ .

36:10 Then read Baruch in the book the @5 of Jeremiah in the @
of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe,
in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's @,
in the ears of all the @.

36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had @)
out of the book all the @5 of the LORD, 36:12 Then he went down
into the king's @, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the
princes sat @, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of
Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of
Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

36:13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the @5 that he had
@), when Baruch read the book in the ears of the @.

36:14 @N all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, @, Take in @
hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the @, and
come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came
unto them.

36:15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
So Baruch read it in @ ears.

36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had @) all the @5, they
were afraid both one and @C, and said unto Baruch, We will surely
tell the king of all @ @5.

36:17 And they asked Baruch, @, Tell us now, How didst thou write
all @ @5 at his @P?  36:18 Then Baruch @> them, He
pronounced all @ @5 unto me with his @P, and I wrote them
with ink in the book.

36:19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

36:20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the @5
in the ears of the king.

36:21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the
king, and in the ears of all the princes @ stood beside the king.

36:22 Now the king sat in the winter@ in the ninth month: and
@ was a fire on the @h burning @	 him.

36:23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read @@ or four
leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that
was on the @h, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that
was on the @h.

36:24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent @ garments, @" the
king, nor any of his @<s that @) all @ @5.

36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
intercession to the king that he @L not burn the roll: but he @L
not hear them.

36:26 But the king @M Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take
Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.

36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, @ that the king
had burned the roll, and the @5 @ Baruch wrote at the @P of
Jeremiah, @, 36:28 Take thee @* @F roll, and write in it
all the former @5 that were in the @O roll, @ Jehoiakim the
king of @ hath burned.

36:29 And thou @ say to Jehoiakim king of @, Thus @
 the
LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, @, Why hast thou written
@in, @, The king of Babylon @ certainly come and destroy
this land, and @ cause to cease from thence man and beast?  36:30
@N thus @
 the LORD of Jehoiakim king of @; He @
have none to sit upon the throne of @: and his dead body @ be
cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.

36:31 And I will punish him and his seed and his @<s for @
iniquity; and I will @( upon them, and upon the inhabitants of
@ , and upon the men of @, all the evil that I have
pronounced @
 them; but they hearkened not.

36:32 Then took Jeremiah @F roll, and gave it to Baruch the
scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote @in from the @P of
Jeremiah all the @5 of the book @ Jehoiakim king of @ had
burned in the fire: and @ were added besides unto them many like
@5.

37:1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the
son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the
land of @.

37:2 But @" he, nor his @<s, nor the @ of the land, did
hearken unto the @5 of the LORD, @ he @0 by the prophet
Jeremiah.

37:3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the @6 to the prophet Jeremiah,
@, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

37:4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out @ the @: for they had
not put him into prison.

37:5 Then Pharaoh's army was come @ out of @-: and when the
Chaldeans that besieged @  @) tidings of them, they departed
from @ .

37:6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah @,
37:7 Thus @
 the LORD, the God of @; Thus @ ye say to the
king of @, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; @.,
Pharaoh's army, @ is come @ to help you, @ return to @-
into @ own land.

37:8 And the Chaldeans @ come @*, and fight @
 this city,
and take it, and burn it with fire.

37:9 Thus @
 the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, @, The
Chaldeans @ surely depart from us: for they @ not depart.

37:10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
fight @
 you, and @ remained but wounded men @ them, yet
@# they rise up @ man in his tent, and burn this city with
fire.

37:11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
broken up from @  for fear of Pharaoh's army, 37:12 Then
Jeremiah went @ out of @  to go into the land of Benjamin,
to separate @9 thence in the @a of the @.

37:13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
was @, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of
Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, @, Thou fallest away
to the Chaldeans.

37:14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
Chaldeans.

But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and @ him
to the princes.

37:15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
and put him in prison in the @ of Jonathan the scribe: for they
had made that the prison.

37:16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
and Jeremiah had remained @ many days; 37:17 Then Zedekiah the
king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his
@, and said, Is @ any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said,
There is: for, said he, thou @ be delivered into the hand of the
king of Babylon.

37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
@
 thee, or @
 thy @<s, or @
 this @, that ye
have put me in prison?  37:19 Where are now your prophets @
prophesied unto you, @, The king of Babylon @ not come
@
 you, nor @
 this land?  37:20 @N hear now, I pray
thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be
accepted @	 thee; that thou cause me not to return to the @ of
Jonathan the scribe, lest I die @.

37:21 Then Zedekiah the king @M that they @# commit
Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they @# give him
daily a piece of @d out of the bakers' street, until all the @d
in the city were spent.

Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

38:1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of
Malchiah, @) the @5 that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the
@, @, 38:2 Thus @
 the LORD, He that remaineth in this
city @ die by the @Q, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but
he that goeth @ to the Chaldeans @ live; for he @ have his
life for a prey, and @ live.

38:3 Thus @
 the LORD, This city @ surely be @= into the
hand of the king of Babylon's army, @ @ take it.

38:4 @N the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
this man be put to @^: for thus he weakeneth the @D of the men
of war that remain in this city, and the @D of all the @, in
@King such @5 unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of
this @, but the hurt.

38:5 Then Zedekiah the king said, @., he is in your hand: for the
king is not he that can do any @7 @
 you.

38:6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison:
and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon @ was no
@Z, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

38:7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs @ was
in the king's @, @) that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon;
the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 38:8 Ebedmelech went
@ out of the king's @, and @0 to the king @, 38:9 My
lord the king, @ men have done evil in all that they have done to
Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is
like to die for hunger in the @' where he is: for @ is no more
@d in the city.

38:10 Then the king @M Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, @, Take
from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out
of the dungeon, @	 he die.

38:11 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the @ of
the king @[ the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old
rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.

38:12 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now @
old cast clouts and rotten rags @[ @ armholes @[ the cords.
And Jeremiah did so.

38:13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

38:14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
him into the third entry that is in the @ of the LORD: and the
king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a @7; hide no@7 from
me.

38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
wilt thou not surely put me to @^? and if I give thee counsel, wilt
thou not hearken unto me?  38:16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly
unto Jeremiah, @, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I
will not put thee to @^, @" will I give thee into the hand of
@ men that seek thy life.

38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus @
 the LORD, the God
of hosts, the God of @; If thou wilt assuredly go @ unto the
king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul @ live, and this city
@ not be burned with fire; and thou @ live, and @ @:
38:18 But if thou wilt not go @ to the king of Babylon's princes,
then @ this city be @= into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they
@ burn it with fire, and thou @ not escape out of @ hand.

38:19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into @
hand, and they mock me.

38:20 But Jeremiah said, They @ not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
thee, the @; of the LORD, @ I @K unto thee: so it @ be
well unto thee, and thy soul @ live.

38:21 But if thou refuse to go @, this is the word that the LORD
hath shewed me: 38:22 And, @%, all the women that are left in the
king of @'s @ @ be @ @ to the king of Babylon's
princes, and @J women @ say, Thy friends have set thee on, and
have prevailed @
 thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they
are turned away back.

38:23 So they @ @( out all thy wives and thy @ to the
Chaldeans: and thou @ not escape out of @ hand, but @ be
taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou @ cause this
city to be burned with fire.

38:24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of @
@5, and thou @ not die.

38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to
@^; also what the king said unto thee: 38:26 Then thou @ say
unto them, I presented my supplication @	 the king, that he @L
not cause me to return to Jonathan's @, to die @.

38:27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
told them @$ to all @ @5 that the king had @M. So
they left off @King with him; for the matter was not perceived.

38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
@  was taken: and he was @ when @  was taken.

39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of @, in the tenth month,
came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army @

@ , and they besieged it.

39:2 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.

39:3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris,
Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the
king of Babylon.

39:4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of @ saw
them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went @ out of
the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate
betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.

39:5 But the Chaldeans' army pursued @ them, and overtook Zedekiah
in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they @
him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of
Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

39:6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
@	 his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of
@.

39:7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains,
to carry him to Babylon.

39:8 And the Chaldeans burned the king's @, and the @s of the
@, with fire, and brake down the walls of @ .

39:9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
into Babylon the remnant of the @ that remained in the city, and
@J that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the @
that remained.

39:10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
@, @ had no@7, in the land of @, and gave them
vineyards and fields at the same time.

39:11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, @, 39:12 Take
him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as
he @ say unto thee.

39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's
princes; 39:14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of
the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
of Shaphan, that he @# carry him home: so he dwelt @ the
@.

39:15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
up in the court of the prison, @, 39:16 Go and @K to
Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, @, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the
God of @; @., I will @( my @5 upon this city for evil,
and not for good; and they @ be accomplished in that day @	
thee.

39:17 But I will deliver thee in that day, @
 the LORD: and thou
@ not be @= into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.

39:18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou @ not fall by the
@Q, but thy life @ be for a prey unto thee: @ thou hast
put thy trust in me, @
 the LORD.

40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, @ that
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when
he had taken him being bound in chains @ all that were carried
away captive of @  and @, @ were carried away captive
unto Babylon.

40:2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this @'.

40:3 Now the LORD hath @ it, and done @$ as he hath said:
@ ye have sinned @
 the LORD, and have not obeyed his
@;, @fore this @7 is come upon you.

40:4 And now, @%, I loose thee this day from the chains @ were
upon @ hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into
Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto
thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: @%, all the land is
@	 thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,
thither go.

40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of
Babylon hath made governor over the @G of @, and dwell with
him @ the @: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto
thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward, and let him go.

40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
dwelt with him @ the @ that were left in the land.

40:7 Now when all the captains of the forces @ were in the fields,
even they and @ men, @) that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed
unto him men, and women, and @, and of the poor of the land, of
them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 40:8 Then they
came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and
Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the
son of a Maachathite, they and @ men.

40:9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them
and to @ men, @, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in
the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it @ be well with
you.

40:10 As for me, @%, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
Chaldeans, @ will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer
fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your
@G that ye have taken.

40:11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and @ the
Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, @) that
the king of Babylon had left a remnant of @, and that he had set
over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 40:12 Even
all the Jews returned out of all @'s whither they were driven, and
came to the land of @, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and ga@d wine
and summer fruits very much.

40:13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 40:14 And
said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the
Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.

40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah @0 to Gedaliah in Mizpah
secretly @, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the
son of Nethaniah, and no man @ know it: wherefore @# he slay
thee, that all the Jews @ are ga@d unto thee @# be
scattered, and the remnant in @ perish?  40:16 But Gedaliah the
son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou @ not do
this @7: for thou @Kest falsely of Ishmael.

41:1 Now it came to pass in the @Hth month, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of
the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
to Mizpah; and @ they did eat @d @? in Mizpah.

41:2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
with the @Q, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made
governor over the land.

41:3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were @V @, and the
men of war.

41:4 And it came to pass the second day @ he had slain Gedaliah,
and no man knew it, 41:5 That @ came certain from Shechem, from
Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having @ beards
shaven, and @ clothes rent, and having cut @T, with
@&s and incense in @ hand, to @( them to the @ of the
LORD.

41:6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went @ from Mizpah to meet
them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met
them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

41:7 And it was so, when they came into the @a of the city, that
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the @a
of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.

41:8 But ten men were @V @ them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us
not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and
of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not @ @
@3.

41:9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
men, whom he had slain @ of Gedaliah, was it @ Asa the king
had made for fear of Baasha king of @: and Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.

41:10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the @
that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the @
that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the
Ammonites.

41:11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, @) of all the evil that Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah had done, 41:12 Then they took all the men, and went to
fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and @V him by the @
@Zs that are in Gibeon.

41:13 Now it came to pass, that when all the @ @ were with
Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, then they were glad.

41:14 So all the @ that Ishmael had carried away captive from
Mizpah cast @+ and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of
Kareah.

41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
men, and went to the Ammonites.

41:16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, all the remnant of the @ whom he had
recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, @ that
he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even @By men of war, and
the women, and the @, and the eunuchs, whom he had @
@* from Gibeon: 41:17 And they departed, and dwelt in the
habitation of Chimham, @ is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into
@-, 41:18 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,
@ Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

42:1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the @ from the
least even unto the @est, came near, 42:2 And said unto Jeremiah
the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted @	
thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this
remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as @ eyes do @%
us:) 42:3 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may
walk, and the @7 that we may do.

42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have @) you;
@%, I will pray unto the LORD your God @$ to your @5;
and it @ come to pass, that whatsoever @7 the LORD @ answer
you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep no@7 back from you.

42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
witness between us, if we do not even @$ to all @ for the
@ the LORD thy God @ send thee to us.

42:6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the @;
of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with
us, when we obey the @; of the LORD our God.

42:7 And it came to pass @ ten days, that the word of the LORD
came unto Jeremiah.

42:8 Then @, he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
the forces @ were with him, and all the @ from the least even
to the @est, 42:9 And said unto them, Thus @
 the LORD, the God
of @, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication @	
him; 42:10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for
I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

42:11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be
not afraid of him, @
 the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and
to deliver you from his hand.

42:12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
you, and cause you to return to your own land.

42:13 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, @" obey the
@; of the LORD your God, 42:14 Saying, No; but we will go into the
land of @-, where we @ see no war, nor hear the sound of the
trumpet, nor have hunger of @d; and @ will we dwell: 42:15 And
now @fore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of @; Thus
@
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; If ye wholly set your
faces to enter into @-, and go to sojourn @; 42:16 Then it
@ come to pass, that the @Q, @ ye feared, @ overtake
you @ in the land of @-, and the famine, whereof ye were
afraid, @ follow close @ you @ in @-; and @ ye
@ die.

42:17 So @ it be with all the men that set @ faces to go into
@- to sojourn @; they @ die by the @Q, by the famine,
and by the pestilence: and none of them @ remain or escape from
the evil that I will @( upon them.

42:18 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; As mine
anger and my fury hath been poured @ upon the inhabitants of
@ ; so @ my fury be poured @ upon you, when ye @
enter into @-: and ye @ be an execration, and an astonishment,
and a curse, and a reproach; and ye @ see this @' no more.

42:19 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of @; Go ye
not into @-: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.

42:20 For ye dissembled in your @s, when ye sent me unto the LORD
your God, @, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and @$
unto all that the LORD our God @ say, so declare unto us, and we
will do it.

42:21 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
obeyed the @; of the LORD your God, nor any @7 for the @ he
hath sent me unto you.

42:22 Now @fore know certainly that ye @ die by the @Q, by
the famine, and by the pestilence, in the @' whither ye desire to
go and to sojourn.

43:1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
@King unto all the @ all the @5 of the LORD @ God, for
@ the LORD @ God had sent him to them, even all @ @5,
43:2 Then @0 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the proud men, @ unto Jeremiah, Thou @Kest
falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into @-
to sojourn @: 43:3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on
@
 us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that
they @B put us to @^, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
and all the @, obeyed not the @; of the LORD, to dwell in the
land of @.

43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces, took all the remnant of @, that were returned from all
nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of @;
43:6 Even men, and women, and @, and the king's daughters, and
@ person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the
prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

43:7 So they came into the land of @-: for they obeyed not the
@; of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

43:8 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
@, 43:9 Take @ stones in @ hand, and hide them in the
clay in the brickkiln, @ is at the entry of Pharaoh's @ in
Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of @; 43:10 And say unto them,
Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; @., I will send
and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my @<, and will set
his throne upon @ stones that I have hid; and he @ spread his
royal pavilion over them.

43:11 And when he cometh, he @ smite the land of @-, and
deliver such as are for @^ to @^; and such as are for captivity
to captivity; and such as are for the @Q to the @Q.

43:12 And I will kindle a fire in the @s of the gods of @-; and
he @ burn them, and carry them away captives: and he @ array
@9 with the land of @-, as a shepherd putteth on his garment;
and he @ go @ from thence in @U.

43:13 He @ break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
land of @-; and the @s of the gods of the @-ians @ he
burn with fire.

44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews @
dwell in the land of @-, @ dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,
and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, @, 44:2 Thus @

the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Ye have seen all the evil that I
have @ upon @ , and upon all the @G of @; and,
@%, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth @in,
44:3 Because of @ wickedness @ they have committed to provoke
me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve @C
gods, whom they knew not, @" they, ye, nor your @s.

44:4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my @<s the prophets, rising
early and sending them, @, Oh, do not this abominable @7 that
I hate.

44:5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined @ ear to turn from @
wickedness, to burn no incense unto @C gods.

44:6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured @, and was
kindled in the @G of @ and in the streets of @ ; and
they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.

44:7 @N now thus @
 the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of
@; Wherefore commit ye this @ evil @
 your souls, to cut
off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of @, to leave
you none to remain; 44:8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the
works of your @D, burning incense unto @C gods in the land of
@-, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye @B cut yourselves off,
and that ye @B be a curse and a reproach @ all the nations of
the @?  44:9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your @s, and
the wickedness of the kings of @, and the wickedness of @
wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives,
@ they have committed in the land of @, and in the streets of
@ ?  44:10 They are not humbled even unto this day, @"
have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set
@	 you and @	 your @s.

44:11 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @;
@., I will set my face @
 you for evil, and to cut off all
@.

44:12 And I will take the remnant of @, that have set @ faces
to go into the land of @- to sojourn @, and they @ all be
consumed, and fall in the land of @-; they @ even be consumed
by the @Q and by the famine: they @ die, from the least even
unto the @est, by the @Q and by the famine: and they @ be
an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

44:13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of @-, as I
have punished @ , by the @Q, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: 44:14 So that none of the remnant of @, @ are gone
into the land of @- to sojourn @, @ escape or remain, that
they @# return into the land of @, to the @ they have a
desire to return to dwell @: for none @ return but such as
@ escape.

44:15 Then all the men @ knew that @ wives had burned incense
unto @C gods, and all the women that stood by, a @ multitude,
even all the @ that dwelt in the land of @-, in Pathros,
@> Jeremiah, @, 44:16 As for the word that thou hast spoken
unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

44:17 But we will certainly do whatsoever @7 goeth @ out of our
own @P, to burn incense unto the queen of @1, and to pour out
@b @&s unto her, as we have done, we, and our @s, our
kings, and our princes, in the @G of @, and in the streets of
@ : for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw
no evil.

44:18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of @1,
and to pour out @b @&s unto her, we have wanted all @,
and have been consumed by the @Q and by the famine.

44:19 And when we burned incense to the queen of @1, and poured
out @b @&s unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her,
and pour out @b @&s unto her, @S our men?  44:20 Then
Jeremiah said unto all the @, to the men, and to the women, and
to all the @ @ had @= him that answer, @, 44:21 The
incense that ye burned in the @G of @, and in the streets of
@ , ye, and your @s, your kings, and your princes, and the
@ of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not
into his mind?  44:22 So that the LORD could no longer bear, @
of the evil of your doings, and @ of the abominations @ ye
have committed; @fore is your land a desolation, and an
astonishment, and a curse, @S an inhabitant, as at this day.

44:23 Because ye have burned incense, and @ ye have sinned
@
 the LORD, and have not obeyed the @; of the LORD, nor
walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;
@fore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.

44:24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the @, and to all the
women, Hear the word of the LORD, all @ that are in the land of
@-: 44:25 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @, @;
Ye and your wives have both spoken with your @Ps, and fulfilled
with your hand, @, We will surely perform our vows that we have
vowed, to burn incense to the queen of @1, and to pour out @b
@&s unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely
perform your vows.

44:26 @N hear ye the word of the LORD, all @ that dwell in
the land of @-; @., I have sworn by my @ name, @
 the
LORD, that my name @ no more be named in the @P of any man of

44:27 @., I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
all the men of @ that are in the land of @- @ be consumed
by the @Q and by the famine, until @ be an end of them.

44:28 Yet a small number that escape the @Q @ return out of the
land of @- into the land of @, and all the remnant of @,
that are gone into the land of @- to sojourn @, @ know
whose @5 @ stand, mine, or @'s.

44:29 And this @ be a sign unto you, @
 the LORD, that I will
punish you in this @', that ye may know that my @5 @ surely
stand @
 you for evil: 44:30 Thus @
 the LORD; @., I will
give Pharaohhophra king of @- into the hand of his enemies, and
into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of
@ into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and
that sought his life.

45:1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet @0 unto Baruch the son of
Neriah, when he had written @ @5 in a book at the @P of
Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
@, @, 45:2 Thus @
 the LORD, the God of @, unto thee,
O Baruch: 45:3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added
grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

45:4 Thus @ thou say unto him, The LORD @

45:5 And seekest thou @ @ for thyself? seek them not: for,

46:1 The word of the LORD @ came to Jeremiah the prophet @

the Gentiles; 46:2 Against @-, @
 the army of Pharaohnecho
king of @-, @ was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, @
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim

46:3 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

46:4 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand @ with
your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.

46:5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
@ @By ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not

 the LORD.

46:6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the @By man escape; they

46:7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose @Zs are moved as
the rivers?  46:8 @- riseth up like a flood, and his @Zs are
moved like the rivers; and he @
, I will go up, and will cover the

46:9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the @By men
come @; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield;
and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

46:10 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the @Q
@ devour, and it @ be satiate and made drunk with @ @I:
for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the

46:11 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of

46:12 The nations have @) of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the

46:13 The word that the LORD @0 to Jeremiah the prophet, how

46:14 Declare ye in @-, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph

46:15 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, @ the

46:16 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon @F: and they said,
Arise, and let us go @* to our own @, and to the land of our

46:17 They did cry @, Pharaoh king of @- is but a noise; he

46:18 As I live, @

Surely as Tabor is @ the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so

46:19 O thou daughter dwelling in @-, furnish thyself to go into

46:20 @- is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it

46:21 Also her hired men are in the @a of her like fatted bullocks;
for they also are turned back, and are fled away @?: they did

the time of @ visitation.

46:22 The @; @of @ go like a serpent; for they @ march

46:23 They @ cut down her forest, @

46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of @, @

47:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet @

the Philistines, @	 that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

47:2 Thus @
 the LORD; @., @Zs rise up out of the north, and
@ be an overflowing flood, and @ overflow the land, and all

47:3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,
at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the
@s @ not look back to @ @ for feebleness of @D;
47:4 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and
to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon @ helper that remaineth: for the
LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of
Caphtor.

47:5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
of @ valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?  47:6 O thou @Q of
the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into
thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

47:7 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath @= it a charge
@
 Ashkelon, and @
 the sea shore? @ hath he appointed
it.

48:1 Against Moab thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; Woe
unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is con@Ved and taken:
Misgab is con@Ved and dismayed.

48:2 There @ be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
devised evil @
 it; come, and let us cut it off from being a
nation. Also thou @ be cut down, O Madmen; the @Q @ pursue

48:3 A @; of crying @ be from Horonaim, spoiling and @

48:4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be @).

48:5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping @ go up; for
in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have @) a cry of
destruction.

48:6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.

48:7 For @ thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,

48:8 And the spoiler @ come upon @ city, and no city @

48:9 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
@G @of @ be desolate, @S any to dwell @in.

48:10 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
cursed be he that keepeth back his @Q from @I.

48:11 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, @"
hath he gone into captivity: @fore his taste remained in him, and
his scent is not changed.

48:12 @N, @%, the days come, @
 the LORD, that I will
send unto him wanderers, that @ cause him to wander, and @
empty his vessels, and break @ bottles.

48:13 And Moab @ be ashamed of Chemosh, as the @ of @ was
ashamed of Bethel @ confidence.

48:14 How say ye, We are @By and strong men for the war?  48:15
Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her @G, and his chosen young
men are gone down to the slaughter, @
 the King, whose name is the
LORD of hosts.

48:16 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
fast.

48:17 All ye that are @+ him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his
name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!
48:18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy @Y,
and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab @ come upon thee, and
he @ destroy thy strong holds.

48:19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that
fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?  48:20 Moab is
con@Ved; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon,
that Moab is spoiled, 48:21 And judgment is come upon the plain
country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, 48:22 And
upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, 48:23 And upon
Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, 48:24 And upon
Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the @G of the land of Moab,
far or near.

48:25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, @
 the
LORD.

48:26 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified @9 @
 the LORD:
Moab also @ wallow in his vomit, and he also @ be in derision.

48:27 For was not @ a derision unto thee? was he @V @
thieves?  for since thou @0st of him, thou skippedst for joy.

48:28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the @G, and dwell in the
rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the
hole's @P.

48:29 We have @) the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of
his @.

48:30 I know his wrath, @
 the LORD; but it @ not be so; his
lies @ not so effect it.

48:31 @N will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
mine @ @ mourn for the men of Kirheres.

48:32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of
Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage.

48:33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from
the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses:
none @ tread with shouting; @ shouting @ be no shouting.

48:34 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,
have they uttered @ @;, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an
heifer of @@ @8 old: for the @Zs also of Nimrim @ be
desolate.

48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, @
 the LORD, him that
offereth in the high @'s, and him that burneth incense to his gods.

48:36 @N mine @ @ sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
@ @ sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: @ the
riches that he hath gotten are perished.

48:37 For @ head @ be bald, and @ beard clipped: upon all
the @D @ be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

48:38 There @ be lamentation generally upon all the @tops of
Moab, and in the streets @of: for I have broken Moab like a vessel
wherein is no pleasure, @
 the LORD.

48:39 They @ howl, @, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
turned the back with shame! so @ Moab be a derision and a
dismaying to all them @+ him.

48:40 For thus @
 the LORD; @., he @ fly as an eagle, and
@ spread his wings over Moab.

48:41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
@By men's @s in Moab at that day @ be as the @ of a
woman in her pangs.

48:42 And Moab @ be destroyed from being a @, @ he hath
magnified @9 @
 the LORD.

48:43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, @ be upon thee, O
inhabitant of Moab, @
 the LORD.

48:44 He that fleeth from the fear @ fall into the pit; and he
that getteth up out of the pit @ be taken in the snare: for I will

 the
LORD.

48:45 They that fled stood @[ the shadow of Heshbon @ of the
force: but a fire @ come @ out of Heshbon, and a flame from
the @a of Sihon, and @ devour the corner of Moab, and the crown
of the head of the tumultuous ones.

48:46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the @ of Chemosh perisheth: for
thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

48:47 Yet will I @( @* the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
@
 the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus @
 the LORD; Hath @ no
sons?  hath he no heir? why then doth @ king inherit Gad, and his
@ dwell in his @G?  49:2 @N, @%, the days come,
@
 the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be @) in
Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it @ be a desolate heap, and her
daughters @ be burned with fire: then @ @ be heir unto
them that were his heirs, @
 the LORD.

49:3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for
@ king @ go into captivity, and his @6s and his princes
@?.

49:4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, @, Who @
come unto me?  49:5 @., I will @( a fear upon thee, @
 the
Lord GOD of hosts, from all @J that be @+ thee; and ye @ be
driven out @ man @c @; and none @ gather up him that
wandereth.

49:6 And @ward I will @( @* the captivity of the @ of
Ammon, @
 the LORD.

49:7 Concerning Edom, thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more
in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is @ wisdom
vanished?  49:8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of
Dedan; for I will @( the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I
will visit him.

49:9 If grapega@rs come to thee, @L they not leave some
gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have
enough.

49:10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret @'s,
and he @ not be able to hide @9: his seed is spoiled, and his
@3, and his neighbours, and he is not.

49:11 Leave thy @less @, I will preserve them alive; and
let thy widows trust in me.

49:12 For thus @
 the LORD; @., they whose judgment was not to
@b of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that @
al@? go unpunished? thou @ not go unpunished, but thou @
surely @b of it.

49:13 For I have sworn by myself, @
 the LORD, that Bozrah @
become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the
@G @of @ be perpetual wastes.

49:14 I have @) a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
unto the heathen, @, Gather ye @?, and come @
 her,
and rise up to the battle.

49:15 For, lo, I will make thee small @ the heathen, and despised
@ men.

49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of @
@, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest
the height of the hill: though thou @#est make thy nest as high as
the eagle, I will @( thee down from thence, @
 the LORD.

49:17 Also Edom @ be a desolation: @ one that goeth by it
@ be astonished, and @ hiss at all the plagues @of.

49:18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
@G @of, @
 the LORD, no man @ abide @, @"
@ a son of man dwell in it.

49:19 @., he @ come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
@
 the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run
away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand @	 me?  49:20 @N hear the counsel
of the LORD, that he hath taken @
 Edom; and his purposes, that
he hath purposed @
 the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of
the flock @ draw them out: surely he @ make @ habitations
desolate with them.

49:21 The @ is moved at the noise of @ fall, at the cry the
noise @of was @) in the Red sea.

49:22 @., he @ come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
wings over Bozrah: and at that day @ the @ of the @By men
of Edom be as the @ of a woman in her pangs.

49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is con@Ved, and Arpad: for they
have @) evil tidings: they are faint@ed; @ is sorrow on the
sea; it cannot be quiet.

49:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear
hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in
travail.

49:25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!  49:26
@N her young men @ fall in her streets, and all the men of
war @ be cut off in that day, @
 the LORD of hosts.

49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it @
consume the palaces of Benhadad.

49:28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, @
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon @ smite, thus @
 the LORD; Arise
ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

49:29 Their tents and @ flocks @ they take away: they @
take to @T @ curtains, and all @ vessels, and @
camels; and they @ cry unto them, Fear is on @ side.

49:30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
@
 the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel
@
 you, and hath conceived a purpose @
 you.

49:31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth @S
care, @
 the LORD, @ have @" gates nor bars, @ dwell
alone.

49:32 And @ camels @ be a booty, and the multitude of @
cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the
utmost corners; and I will @( @ calamity from all sides
@of, @
 the LORD.

49:33 And Hazor @ be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
ever: @ @ no man abide @, nor any son of man dwell in it.

49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet @

Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of @, @,
49:35 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; @., I will break the bow of
Elam, the chief of @ @B.

49:36 And upon Elam will I @( the four winds from the four quarters
of @1, and will scatter them toward all @J winds; and @
@ be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam @ not come.

49:37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed @	 @ enemies, and
@	 them that seek @ life: and I will @( evil upon them,
even my fierce anger, @
 the LORD; and I will send the @Q @
them, till I have consumed them: 49:38 And I will set my throne in
Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, @
 the
LORD.

49:39 But it @ come to pass in the latter days, that I will @(
@* the captivity of Elam, @
 the LORD.

50:1 The word that the LORD @0 @
 Babylon and @
 the land
of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

50:2 Declare ye @ the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is con@Ved,
Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are con@Ved, her images are
broken in pieces.

50:3 For out of the north @ cometh up a nation @
 her, @
@ make her land desolate, and none @ dwell @in: they @
remove, they @ depart, both man and beast.

50:4 In @J days, and in that time, @
 the LORD, the @ of
@ @ come, they and the @ of @ @?, going and
weeping: they @ go, and seek the LORD @ God.

50:5 They @ ask the way to Zion with @ faces thitherward,
@, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual
covenant that @ not be forgotten.

50:6 My @ hath been lost sheep: @ shepherds have caused them
to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have
gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten @ resting@'.

50:7 All that @V them have devoured them: and @ adversaries
said, We offend not, @ they have sinned @
 the LORD, the
habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of @ @s.

50:8 Remove out of the @a of Babylon, and go @ out of the land
of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats @	 the flocks.

50:9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up @
 Babylon an
assembly of @ nations from the north country: and they @ set
@T in array @
 her; from thence she @ be taken: @
arrows @ be as of a @By expert man; none @ return in vain.

50:10 And Chaldea @ be a spoil: all that spoil her @ be
satisfied, @
 the LORD.

50:11 Because ye were glad, @ ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
mine heritage, @ ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and
bellow as bulls; 50:12 Your m@C @ be sore con@Ved; she that
bare you @ be ashamed: @%, the hindermost of the nations @
be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it @ not be inhabited, but
it @ be wholly desolate: @ one that goeth by Babylon @ be
astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

50:14 Put yourselves in array @
 Babylon round @+: all ye that
bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned
@
 the LORD.

50:15 Shout @
 her round @+: she hath @= her hand: her
@Vations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the
vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do
unto her.

50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle
in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing @Q they @
turn @ one to his @, and they @ flee @ one to his own
land.

50:17 @ is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
@O the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

50:18 @N thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @;
@., I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have
punished the king of Assyria.

50:19 And I will @( @ @* to his habitation, and he @
feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul @ be satisfied upon mount
Ephraim and Gilead.

50:20 In @J days, and in that time, @
 the LORD, the iniquity of
@ @ be sought for, and @ @ be none; and the sins of
@, and they @ not be @V: for I will pardon them whom I
reserve.

50:21 Go up @
 the land of Merathaim, even @
 it, and
@
 the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy @
them, @
 the LORD, and do @$ to all that I have @M
thee.

50:22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of @ destruction.

50:23 How is the hammer of the whole @ cut as@[ and broken! how
is Babylon become a desolation @ the nations!  50:24 I have laid a
snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not
aware: thou art @V, and also caught, @ thou hast striven
@
 the LORD.

50:25 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath @ @ the
weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of
hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

50:26 Come @
 her from the utmost border, open her store@s:
cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let no@7 of her be
left.

50:27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
unto them! for @ day is come, the time of @ visitation.

50:28 The @; of them that flee and escape out of the land of
Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the
vengeance of his temple.

50:29 Call @? the archers @
 Babylon: all ye that bend the
bow, camp @
 it round @+; let none @of escape: recompense
her @$ to her work; @$ to all that she hath done, do
unto her: for she hath been proud @
 the LORD, @
 the Holy
One of @.

50:30 @N @ her young men fall in the streets, and all her
men of war @ be cut off in that day, @
 the LORD.

50:31 @., I am @
 thee, O thou most proud, @
 the Lord GOD
of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.

50:32 And the most proud @ stumble and fall, and none @ raise
him up: and I will kindle a fire in his @G, and it @ devour
all round @+ him.

50:33 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; The @ of @ and the

50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he

50:35 A @Q is upon the Chaldeans, @

50:36 A @Q is upon the liars; and they @ dote: a @Q is upon

50:37 A @Q is upon @ horses, and upon @ chariots, and upon

50:38 A drought is upon her @Zs; and they @ be dried up: for it

50:41 @., a @ @ come from the north, and a @ nation,

50:42 They @ hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will

ride upon horses, @ one put in array, like a man to the battle,
@

50:43 The king of Babylon hath @) the report of them, and his @D
waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in
travail.

50:44 @., he @ come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan

away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand @	 me?  50:45 @N hear ye the

 Babylon; and his
purposes, that he hath purposed @
 the land of the Chaldeans:
Surely the least of the flock @ draw them out: surely he @

50:46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the @ is moved, and

51:1 Thus @
 the LORD; @., I will raise up @
 Babylon, and

51:3 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and @

51:4 Thus the slain @ fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they

51:5 For @ hath not been forsaken, nor @ of his God, of the

51:6 Flee out of the @a of Babylon, and deliver @ man his soul:

vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

51:7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all
the @ drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; @fore the
nations are mad.

51:8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm
for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

51:9 We @L have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her,
and let us go @ one into his own country: for her judgment
reacheth unto @1, and is lifted up even to the skies.

51:10 The LORD hath @ @ our @ceousness: come, and let us
declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

51:11 Make b@c the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised

Babylon, to destroy it; @ it is the vengeance of the LORD, the
vengeance of his temple.

51:12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath

51:13 O thou that dwellest upon many @Zs, abundant in treasures,
@ end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

51:14 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by @9, @, Surely I will
fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they @ lift up a

51:15 He hath made the @ by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the @1 by his
@[standing.

51:16 When he uttereth his @;, @ is a multitude of @Zs in

@: he maketh lightnings with rain, and @(eth @ the wind out

51:17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; @ @Ver is
con@Ved by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and
@ is no breath in them.

51:18 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of @

51:19 The portion of @] is not like them; for he is the former of
all @: and @ is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of

51:20 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I
break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
51:21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 51:22
With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee
will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in
pieces the young man and the maid; 51:23 I will also break in pieces
with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in
pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break
in pieces captains and rulers.

51:24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
Chaldea all @ evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,
@
 the LORD.

51:25 @., I am @
 thee, O destroying mountain, @
 the
LORD, @ destroyest all the @: and I will stretch out mine hand

51:26 And they @ not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a

51:27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet @ the
nations, prepare the nations @

the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain
@

51:28 Prepare @
 her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the
captains @of, and all the rulers @of, and all the land of his

51:29 And the land @ tremble and sorrow: for @ purpose of the
LORD @ be performed @
 Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a
desolation @S an inhabitant.

51:30 The @By men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have
remained in @ holds: @ @B hath failed; they became as
women: they have burned her dwelling@'s; her bars are broken.

51:31 One post @ run to meet @F, and one messenger to meet
@F, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one
end, 51:32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have
burned with fire, and the men of war are aff@ced.

51:33 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @; The
daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh
her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest @ come.

51:34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up
like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath
cast me out.

51:35 The violence done to me and to my @R be upon Babylon, @
the inhabitant of Zion say; and my @I upon the inhabitants of
Chaldea, @ @  say.

51:36 @N thus @
 the LORD; @., I will plead thy cause,

springs dry.

51:37 And Babylon @ become heaps, a dwelling@' for dragons, an
astonishment, and an hissing, @S an inhabitant.

51:38 They @ roar @? like lions: they @ yell as lions'

51:39 In @ heat I will make @ feasts, and I will make them
drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not

51:40 I will @( them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
with he goats.

51:41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole @
surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment @ the nations!
51:42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
multitude of the waves @of.

51:43 Her @G are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
land wherein no man dwelleth, @" doth any son of man pass
@by.

51:44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will @( @ out of

51:45 My @, go ye out of the @a of her, and deliver ye @

51:46 And lest your @ faint, and ye fear for the rumour that @

51:47 @N, @%, the days come, that I will do judgment upon

51:48 Then the @1 and the @, and all that is @in, @
sing for Babylon: for the spoilers @ come unto her from the north,
@
 the LORD.

51:49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of @ to fall, so at
Babylon @ fall the slain of all the @.

51:50 Ye that have escaped the @Q, go away, stand not still:
remember the LORD afar off, and let @  come into your mind.

51:51 We are con@Ved, @ we have @) reproach: shame hath

51:52 Wherefore, @%, the days come, @

51:53 Though Babylon @# mount up to @1, and though she @#
fortify the height of her strength, yet from me @ spoilers come
unto her, @
 the LORD.

51:54 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and @ destruction from
the land of the Chaldeans: 51:55 Because the LORD hath spoiled
Babylon, and destroyed out of her the @ @;; when her waves do
roar like @ @Zs, a noise of @ @; is uttered: 51:56
Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her

51:57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her
captains, and her rulers, and her @By men: and they @ sleep a
perpetual sleep, and not wake, @
 the King, whose name is the LORD

51:58 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon @
be utterly broken, and her high gates @ be burned with fire; and
the @ @ labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they
@ be weary.

51:59 The word @ Jeremiah the prophet @M Seraiah the son of
Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of
@ into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah
was a quiet prince.

51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that @# come upon
Babylon, even all @ @5 that are written @
 Babylon.

51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
@ see, and @ read all @ @5; 51:62 Then @ thou say,
O LORD, thou hast spoken @
 this @', to cut it off, that none
@ remain in it, @" man nor beast, but that it @ be
desolate for ever.

51:63 And it @ be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
book, that thou @ bind a stone to it, and cast it into the @a
of Euphrates: 51:64 And thou @ say, Thus @ Babylon sink, and
@ not rise from the evil that I will @( upon her: and they
@ be weary. Thus far are the @5 of Jeremiah.

52:1 Zedekiah was one and twenty @8 old when he began to reign, and
he reigned eleven @8 in @ . And his m@C's name was
Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

52:2 And he did that @ was evil in the eyes of the LORD, @$
to all that Jehoiakim had done.

52:3 For @E the anger of the LORD it came to pass in @ 
and @, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
rebelled @
 the king of Babylon.

52:4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon came, he and all his army, @
 @ , and pitched
@
 it, and built forts @
 it round @+.

52:5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

52:6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
famine was sore in the city, so that @ was no @d for the @
of the land.

52:7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
went @ out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the
two walls, @ was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by
the city round @+:) and they went by the way of the plain.

52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued @ the king, and
overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was
scattered from him.

52:9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon
him.

52:10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah @	 his
eyes: he slew also all the princes of @ in Riblah.

52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison
till the day of his @^.

52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, @ was
the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, @ served the king of Babylon,
into @ , 52:13 And burned the @ of the LORD, and the king's
@; and all the @s of @ , and all the @s of the
@ men, burned he with fire: 52:14 And all the army of the
Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the
walls of @  round @+.

52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
certain of the poor of the @, and the residue of the @ that
remained in the city, and @J that fell away, that fell to the king
of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

52:17 Also the pillars of brass that were in the @ of the LORD,
and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the @ of the LORD,
the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

52:18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
ministered, took they away.

52:19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that
@ was of gold in gold, and that @ was of silver in silver,
took the captain of the guard away.

52:20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
@[ the bases, @ king Solomon had made in the @ of the LORD:
the brass of all @ vessels was @S weight.

52:21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the
thickness @of was four fingers: it was hollow.

52:22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round @+, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
pomegranates were like unto @.

52:23 And @ were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all
the pomegranates upon the network were an @/ round @+.

52:24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief @6, and
Zephaniah the second @6, and the @@ keepers of the door: 52:25
He took also out of the city an eunuch, @ had the charge of the
men of war; and @H men of them that were near the king's person,
@ were @V in the city; and the principal scribe of the host,
who mustered the @ of the land; and @@score men of the @
of the land, that were @V in the @a of the city.

52:26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and @
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to @^ in
Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus @ was carried away captive out
of his own land.

52:28 This is the @ whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in
the @Hth year @@ @: Jews and @@ and twenty: 52:29 In
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from

twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive of the Jews @H @/ forty and five persons:
all the persons were four @: and six @/.

52:31 And it came to pass in the @H and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of @, in the twelfth month, in the
five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon
in the @O year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king

52:32 And @0 kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne

The Lamentations of Jeremiah


1:1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of @! how is
she become as a widow! she that was @ @ the nations, and
princess @ the provinces, how is she become tributary!  1:2 She
weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: @ all
her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt
treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.

1:3 @ is gone into captivity @ of affliction, and @ of
@ servitude: she dwelleth @ the heathen, she findeth no rest:
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.

1:4 The ways of Zion do mourn, @ none come to the solemn feasts:
all her gates are desolate: her @6s sigh, her virgins are
afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

1:5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD
hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her
@ are gone into captivity @	 the enemy.

1:6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone
@S strength @	 the pursuer.

1:7 @  remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
miseries all her pleasant @ that she had in the days of old, when
her @ fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the
adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.

1:8 @  hath grievously sinned; @fore she is removed: all
that honoured her despise her, @ they have seen her nakedness:
yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

1:9 Her fil@ss is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;
@fore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD,
@% my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified @9.

1:10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
@: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary,
whom thou didst command that they @# not enter into thy
@`.

1:11 All her @ sigh, they seek @d; they have @= @
pleasant @ for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
consider; for I am become vile.

1:12 Is it no@7 to you, all ye that pass by? @%, and see if
@ be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, @ is done unto me,
wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

1:13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
@
 them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me
back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

1:14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall,
the LORD hath delivered me into @ @D, from whom I am not able
to rise up.

1:15 The LORD hath trodden @[ foot all my @By men in the @a
of me: he hath @, an assembly @
 me to crush my young men:
the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of @, as in a
winepress.

1:16 For @ @ I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
@Z, @ the comforter that @# relieve my soul is far from
me: my @ are desolate, @ the enemy prevailed.

1:17 Zion spreadeth @ her @D, and @ is none to comfort her:
the LORD hath @M concerning @], that his adversaries @#
be round @+ him: @  is as a menstruous woman @ them.

1:18 The LORD is @ceous; for I have rebelled @
 his
commandment: hear, I pray you, all @, and @% my sorrow: my
virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

1:19 I @, for my lovers, but they deceived me: my @6s and mine
elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought @ meat to
relieve @ souls.

1:20 @., O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
mine @ is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad
the @Q bereaveth, at home @ is as @^.

1:21 They have @) that I sigh: @ is none to comfort me: all
mine enemies have @) of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast
done it: thou wilt @( the day that thou hast @,, and they @
be like unto me.

1:22 Let all @ wickedness come @	 thee; and do unto them, as
thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are
many, and my @ is faint.

2:1 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
anger, and cast down from @1 unto the @ the beauty of @,
and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!  2:2 The
LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of @], and hath not
pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the
daughter of @; he hath @ them down to the ground: he hath
polluted the kingdom and the princes @of.

2:3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of @: he
hath drawn back his @c hand from @	 the enemy, and he burned
@
 @] like a flaming fire, @ devoureth round @+.

2:4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his @c hand
as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.

2:5 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up @, he hath
swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and
hath increased in the daughter of @ mourning and lamentation.

2:6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of
a garden: he hath destroyed his @'s of the assembly: the LORD hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and
hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the @6.

2:7 The LORD hath cast off his @\, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
he hath @= up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;
they have made a noise in the @ of the LORD, as in the day of a
solemn feast.

2:8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand
from destroying: @fore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
they languished @?.

2:9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken
her bars: her king and her princes are @ the Gentiles: the law is
no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.

2:10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep
silence: they have cast up dust upon @ heads; they have girded
@T with sackcloth: the virgins of @  hang down @
heads to the ground.

2:11 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is
poured upon the @, for the destruction of the daughter of my
@; @ the @ and the sucklings swoon in the streets of
the city.

2:12 They say to @ m@Cs, Where is corn and wine? when they
swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when @ soul was
poured out into @ m@Cs' bosom.

2:13 What @7 @ I take to witness for thee? what @7 @ I
liken to thee, O daughter of @ ? what @ I equal to thee,
that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is
@ like the sea: who can heal thee?  2:14 Thy prophets have seen
vain and foolish @ for thee: and they have not discovered @
iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false
burdens and causes of banishment.

2:15 All that pass by clap @ @D at thee; they hiss and wag
@ head at the daughter of @ , @, Is this the city that
men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole @?  2:16
All @ enemies have opened @ @P @
 thee: they hiss and
gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is
the day that we looked for; we have @V, we have seen it.

2:17 The LORD hath done that @ he had devised; he hath fulfilled
his word that he had @M in the days of old: he hath thrown
down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused @ enemy to rejoice
over thee, he hath set up the horn of @ adversaries.

2:18 Their @ cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,
let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest;
let not the apple of @ eye cease.

2:19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
out @ @ like @Z @	 the face of the LORD: lift up thy
@D toward him for the life of thy young @, that faint for
hunger in the top of @ street.

2:20 @., O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall
the women eat @ fruit, and @ of a span long? @ the
@6 and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?  2:21
The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and
my young men are fallen by the @Q; thou hast slain them in the day
of @ anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.

2:22 Thou hast @, as in a solemn day my terrors round @+, so
that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: @J
that I have swaddled and @ up hath mine enemy consumed.

3:1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

3:2 He hath led me, and @ me into darkness, but not into light.

3:3 Surely @
 me is he turned; he turneth his hand @
 me all
the day.

3:4 My @R and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

3:5 He hath builded @
 me, and compassed me with gall and
travail.

3:6 He hath set me in dark @'s, as they that be dead of old.

3:7 He hath hedged me @+, that I cannot get out: he hath made my
chain heavy.

3:8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

3:9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
crooked.

3:10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
@'s.

3:11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
made me desolate.

3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

3:13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

3:14 I was a derision to all my @; and @ song all the day.

3:15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
wormwood.

3:16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
me with ashes.

3:17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from @U: I forgat
prosperity.

3:18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
3:19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
gall.

3:20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

3:21 This I recall to my mind, @fore have I hope.

3:22 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, @ his
compassions fail not.

3:23 They are new @ morning: @ is thy faithfulness.

3:24 The LORD is my portion, @
 my soul; @fore will I hope in
him.

3:25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
seeketh him.

3:26 It is good that a man @# both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the LORD.

3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

3:28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, @ he hath borne it
upon him.

3:29 He putteth his @P in the dust; if so be @ may be hope.

3:30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
with reproach.

3:31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever: 3:32 But though he cause
grief, yet will he have compassion @$ to the multitude of his
mercies.

3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the @ of men.

3:34 To crush @[ his feet all the prisoners of the @.

3:35 To turn aside the @c of a man @	 the face of the most
High, 3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

3:37 Who is he that @
, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
commandeth it not?  3:38 Out of the @P of the most High proceedeth
not evil and good?  3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man
for the punishment of his sins?  3:40 Let us search and try our ways,
and turn @* to the LORD.

3:41 Let us lift up our @ with our @D unto God in the @1s.

3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

3:43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
thou hast not pitied.

3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer @#

3:45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the @a of
the @.

3:46 All our enemies have opened @ @Ps @

3:47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

3:48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of @Z for the destruction of
the daughter of my @.

3:49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, @S any

3:50 Till the LORD look down, and @% from @1.

3:51 Mine eye affecteth mine @ @ of all the daughters of my

3:52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, @S cause.

3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon

3:54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

3:55 I @, upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

3:56 Thou hast @) my @;: hide not @ ear at my brea@7, at

3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I @, upon thee: thou
saidst, Fear not.

3:58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
redeemed my life.

3:59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

3:60 Thou hast seen all @ vengeance and all @ imaginations

3:61 Thou hast @) @ reproach, O LORD, and all @

3:63 @. @ sitting down, and @ rising up; I am @

3:64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, @$ to the work of
@ @D.

3:65 Give them sorrow of @, thy curse unto them.

3:66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from @[ the @1s of the

4:1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the
stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of @ street.

4:2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
esteemed as @en pitchers, the work of the @D of the potter!
4:3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to @
young ones: the daughter of my @ is become cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness.

4:4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his @P
for thirst: the young @ ask @d, and no man breaketh it unto
them.

4:5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they
that were @ up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

4:6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my @ is
@er than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown
as in a moment, and no @D stayed on her.

4:7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,
they were more ruddy in body than rubies, @ polishing was of
sapphire: 4:8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known
in the streets: @ skin cleaveth to @ bones; it is wi@d, it
is become like a stick.

4:9 They that be slain with the @Q are better than they that be
slain with hunger: for @ pine away, stricken @E for want of
the fruits of the field.

4:10 The @D of the pitiful women have sodden @ own @:
they were @ meat in the destruction of the daughter of my @.

4:11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured
the @Vations @of.

4:12 The kings of the @, and all the inhabitants of the world,
@L not have believed that the adversary and the enemy @# have
entered into the gates of @ .

4:13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her @6s,
that have shed the @I of the just in the @a of her, 4:14 They
have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted
@T with @I, so that men could not touch @ garments.

4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said @ the
heathen, They @ no more sojourn @.

4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the @6s, they favoured not
the elders.

4:17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

4:18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

4:19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the @1: they
pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness.

4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken
in @ pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we @ live @

4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the

4:22 The punishment of @ iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of

5:1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and @% our

5:2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our @s to aliens.

5:3 We are orphans and @less, our m@Cs are as widows.

5:4 We have drunken our @Z for money; our wood is sold unto us.

5:5 Our necks are @[ persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

5:6 We have @= the hand to the @-ians, and to the Assyrians, to

5:7 Our @s have sinned, and are not; and we have borne @
iniquities.

5:8 Servants have ruled over us: @ is none that doth deliver us
out of @ hand.

5:9 We gat our @d with the peril of our lives @ of the @Q

5:10 Our skin was black like an oven @ of the terrible famine.

5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the @G of
@.

5:12 Princes are hanged up by @ hand: the faces of elders were not

5:13 They took the young men to grind, and the @ fell @[ the

5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from @
musick.

5:15 The joy of our @ is ceased; our dance is turned into

5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have

5:18 Because of the mountain of Zion, @ is desolate, the foxes

5:19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to

5:20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long

renew our days as of old.

5:22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth @

The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel


1:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,
in the fifth day of the month, as I was @ the captives by the river
of Chebar, that the @1s were opened, and I saw visions of God.

1:2 In the fifth day of the month, @ was the fifth year of king
Jehoiachin's captivity, 1:3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto
Ezekiel the @6, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by
the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was @ upon him.

1:4 And I looked, and, @%, a whirlwind came out of the north, a
@ cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a b@cness was @+
it, and out of the @a @of as the colour of amber, out of the
@a of the fire.

1:5 Also out of the @a @of came the likeness of four living
creatures. And this was @ appearance; they had the likeness of a
man.

1:6 And @ one had four faces, and @ one had four wings.

1:7 And @ feet were straight feet; and the sole of @ feet was
like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of
burnished brass.

1:8 And they had the @D of a man @[ @ wings on @ four
sides; and they four had @ faces and @ wings.

1:9 Their wings were joined one to @F; they turned not when they
went; they went @ one straight forward.

1:10 As for the likeness of @ faces, they four had the face of a
man, and the face of a lion, on the @c side: and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an
eagle.

1:11 Thus were @ faces: and @ wings were stretched upward; two
wings of @ one were joined one to @F, and two covered @
bodies.

1:12 And they went @ one straight forward: whither the spirit was
to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, @ appearance was
like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went
up and down @ the living creatures; and the fire was b@c, and
out of the fire went @ lightning.

1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning.

1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, @% one wheel upon the
@ by the living creatures, with his four faces.

1:16 The appearance of the wheels and @ work was like unto the
colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and @
appearance and @ work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a
wheel.

1:17 When they went, they went upon @ four sides: and they turned
not when they went.

1:18 As for @ rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
and @ rings were full of eyes round @+ them four.

1:19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and
when the living creatures were lifted up from the @, the wheels
were lifted up.

1:20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was @
spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over @
 them: for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

1:21 When @J went, @ went; and when @J stood, @ stood;
and when @J were lifted up from the @, the wheels were lifted
up over @
 them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels.

1:22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched @
over @ heads above.

1:23 And @[ the firmament were @ wings straight, the one toward
the @C: @ one had two, @ covered on this side, and @
one had two, @ covered on that side, @ bodies.

1:24 And when they went, I @) the noise of @ wings, like the
noise of @ @Zs, as the @; of the Al@By, the @; of
speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down @
wings.

1:25 And @ was a @; from the firmament that was over @
heads, when they stood, and had let down @ wings.

1:26 And above the firmament that was over @ heads was the
likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man
above upon it.

1:27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round
@+ within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and
from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the
appearance of fire, and it had b@cness round @+.

1:28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
rain, so was the appearance of the b@cness round @+. This was
the appearance of the likeness of the @Y of the LORD. And when I
saw it, I fell upon my face, and I @) a @; of one that @0.

2:1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will
@K unto thee.

2:2 And the spirit entered into me when he @0 unto me, and set me
upon my feet, that I @) him that @0 unto me.

2:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the @ of
@, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled @
 me: they and
@ @s have transgressed @
 me, even unto this very day.

2:4 For they are impudent @ and stiff@ed. I do send thee
unto them; and thou @ say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD.

2:5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
(for they are a rebellious @,) yet @ know that @ hath been
a prophet @ them.

2:6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, @" be afraid of
@ @5, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost
dwell @ scorpions: be not afraid of @ @5, nor be dismayed
at @ looks, though they be a rebellious @.

2:7 And thou @ @K my @5 unto them, whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.

2:8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
rebellious like that rebellious @: open thy @P, and eat that I
give thee.

2:9 And when I looked, @%, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a
roll of a book was @in; 2:10 And he spread it @	 me; and it
was written within and @S: and @ was written @in
lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat
this roll, and go @K unto the @ of @.

3:2 So I opened my @P, and he caused me to eat that roll.

3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill
thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it
was in my @P as honey for sweetness.

3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the @ of
@, and @K with my @5 unto them.

3:5 For thou art not sent to a @ of a strange speech and of an
hard language, but to the @ of @; 3:6 Not to many @ of a
strange speech and of an hard language, whose @5 thou canst not
@[stand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they @L have hearkened
unto thee.

3:7 But the @ of @ will not hearken unto thee; for they will
not hearken unto me: for all the @ of @ are impudent and
hard@ed.

3:8 @., I have made thy face strong @
 @ faces, and thy
forehead strong @
 @ foreheads.

3:9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
them not, @" be dismayed at @ looks, though they be a
rebellious @.

3:10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my @5 that I @
@K unto thee receive in @ @, and hear with @ ears.

3:11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the @ of
thy @, and @K unto them, and tell them, Thus @
 the Lord
GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

3:12 Then the spirit took me up, and I @) behind me a @; of a
@ rushing, @, Blessed be the @Y of the LORD from his
@'.

3:13 I @) also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
touched one @F, and the noise of the wheels over @
 them,
and a noise of a @ rushing.

3:14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was
strong upon me.

3:15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained @
astonished @ them @H days.

3:16 And it came to pass at the end of @H days, that the word of
the LORD came unto me, @, 3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a
watchman unto the @ of @: @fore hear the word at my
@P, and give them warning from me.

3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou @ surely die; and thou
givest him not warning, nor @Kest to warn the wicked from his
wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man @ die in his
iniquity; but his @I will I require at @ hand.

3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,
nor from his wicked way, he @ die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul.

3:20 Again, When a @ceous man doth turn from his @ceousness, and
commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block @	 him, he @ die:
@ thou hast not @= him warning, he @ die in his sin, and
his @ceousness @ he hath done @ not be remembered; but his
@I will I require at @ hand.

3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the @ceous man, that the @ceous
sin not, and he doth not sin, he @ surely live, @ he is
warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

3:22 And the hand of the LORD was @ upon me; and he said unto me,
Arise, go @ into the plain, and I will @ talk with thee.

3:23 Then I arose, and went @ into the plain: and, @%, the
@Y of the LORD stood @, as the @Y @ I saw by the river
of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

3:24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
@0 with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within @ @.

3:25 But thou, O son of man, @%, they @ put bands upon thee,
and @ bind thee with them, and thou @ not go out @ them:
3:26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy @P, that
thou @ be dumb, and @ not be to them a reprover: for they are
a rebellious @.

3:27 But when I @K with thee, I will open thy @P, and thou @
say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear;
and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious
@.

4:1 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it @	 thee,
and pourtray upon it the city, even @ : 4:2 And lay siege
@
 it, and build a fort @
 it, and cast a mount @
 it;
set the camp also @
 it, and set battering rams @
 it round
@+.

4:3 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of
iron between thee and the city: and set thy face @
 it, and it

4:4 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the

4:5 For I have laid upon thee the @8 of @ iniquity, @$

4:6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie @* on thy @c side,

have appointed thee each day for a year.

4:7 @N thou @ set thy face toward the siege of @ ,
and @ arm @ be uncovered, and thou @ prophesy @
 it.

4:8 And, @%, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou @ not turn
thee from one side to @F, till thou hast ended the days of thy
siege.

4:9 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and
make thee @d @of, @$ to the number of the days that thou
@ lie upon thy side, @@ @/ and ninety days @ thou eat
@of.

4:10 And thy meat @ thou @ eat @ be by weight, twenty
shekels a day: from time to time @ thou eat it.

4:11 Thou @ @b also @Z by measure, the sixth part of an hin:
from time to time @ thou @b.

4:12 And thou @ eat it as barley cakes, and thou @ bake it
with dung that cometh out of man, in @ sight.

4:13 And the LORD said, Even thus @ the @ of @ eat
@ defiled @d @ the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.

4:14 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! @%, my soul hath not been polluted:
for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that @
dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; @" came @ abominable
@R into my @P.

4:15 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have @= thee cow's dung for man's
dung, and thou @ prepare thy @d @with.

4:16 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, @%, I will break the
staff of @d in @ : and they @ eat @d by weight, and
with care; and they @ @b @Z by measure, and with
astonishment: 4:17 That they may want @d and @Z, and be astonied
one with @F, and consume away for @ iniquity.

5:1 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon @ head and upon thy
beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.

5:2 Thou @ burn with fire a third part in the @a of the city,
when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou @ take a third
part, and smite @+ it with a knife: and a third part thou @
scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a @Q @ them.

5:3 Thou @ also take @of a few in number, and bind them in thy
skirts.

5:4 Then take of them @*, and cast them into the @a of the fire,
and burn them in the fire; for @of @ a fire come @ into
all the @ of @.

5:5 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; This is @ : I have set it in the
@a of the nations and countries that are round @+ her.

5:6 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round @+
her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not
walked in them.

5:7 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than
the nations that are round @+ you, and have not walked in my
statutes, @" have kept my judgments, @" have done @$
to the judgments of the nations that are round @+ you; 5:8
@N thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I, even I, am @
 thee,
and will execute judgments in the @a of thee in the sight of the
nations.

5:9 And I will do in thee that @ I have not done, and whereunto I
will not do any more the like, @ of all @ abominations.

5:10 @N the @s @ eat the sons in the @a of thee,
and the sons @ eat @ @s; and I will execute judgments in
thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.

5:11 Wherefore, as I live, @
 the Lord GOD; Surely, @ thou
hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable @, and with all
@ abominations, @fore will I also diminish thee; @" @
mine eye spare, @" will I have any pity.

5:12 A third part of thee @ die with the pestilence, and with
famine @ they be consumed in the @a of thee: and a third part
@ fall by the @Q round @+ thee; and I will scatter a third
part into all the winds, and I will draw out a @Q @ them.

5:13 Thus @ mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury
to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they @ know that I
the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury
in them.

5:14 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach @ the nations
that are round @+ thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

5:15 So it @ be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
astonishment unto the nations that are round @+ thee, when I @
execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.
I the LORD have spoken it.

5:16 When I @ send upon them the evil arrows of famine, @
@ be for @ destruction, and @ I will send to destroy you:
and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of
@d: 5:17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they
@ bereave thee: and pestilence and @I @ pass @E thee;
and I will @( the @Q upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.

6:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 6:2 Son of man, set
thy face toward the mountains of @, and prophesy @
 them,
6:3 And say, Ye mountains of @, hear the word of the Lord GOD;
Thus @
 the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the
rivers, and to the valleys; @., I, even I, will @( a @Q upon
you, and I will destroy your high @'s.

6:4 And your @\s @ be desolate, and your images @ be
broken: and I will cast down your slain men @	 your idols.

6:5 And I will lay the dead carcases of the @ of @ @	
@ idols; and I will scatter your bones round @+ your @\s.

6:6 In all your dwelling@'s the @G @ be laid waste, and the
high @'s @ be desolate; that your @\s may be laid waste and
made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images
may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.

6:7 And the slain @ fall in the @a of you, and ye @ know
that I am the LORD.

6:8 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that @
escape the @Q @ the nations, when ye @ be scattered @E
the countries.

6:9 And they that escape of you @ remember me @ the nations
whither they @ be carried captives, @ I am broken with @
whorish @, @ hath departed from me, and with @ eyes, @
go a whoring @ @ idols: and they @ lothe @T for
the evils @ they have committed in all @ abominations.

6:10 And they @ know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said
in vain that I @L do this evil unto them.

6:11 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Smite with @ hand, and stamp with
thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the @ of
@! for they @ fall by the @Q, by the famine, and by the
pestilence.

6:12 He that is far off @ die of the pestilence; and he that is
near @ fall by the @Q; and he that remaineth and is besieged
@ die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.

6:13 Then @ ye know that I am the LORD, when @ slain men @
be @ @ idols round @+ @ @\s, upon @ high hill,
in all the tops of the mountains, and @[ @ green tree, and
@[ @ thick oak, the @' where they did offer sweet savour to
all @ idols.

6:14 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in
all @ habitations: and they @ know that I am the LORD.

7:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 7:2 Also, thou
son of man, thus @
 the Lord GOD unto the land of @; An end,
the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

7:3 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
thee, and will judge thee @$ to thy ways, and will recompense
upon thee all @ abominations.

7:4 And mine eye @ not spare thee, @" will I have pity: but I
will recompense thy ways upon thee, and @ abominations @ be in
the @a of thee: and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

7:5 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, @%, is come.

7:6 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; @%, it
is come.

7:7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding
@* of the mountains.

7:8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
anger upon thee: and I will judge thee @$ to thy ways, and will
recompense thee for all @ abominations.

7:9 And mine eye @ not spare, @" will I have pity: I will
recompense thee @$ to thy ways and @ abominations that are
in the @a of thee; and ye @ know that I am the LORD that
smiteth.

7:10 @. the day, @%, it is come: the morning is gone @;
the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

7:11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them @
remain, nor of @ multitude, nor of any of @'s: @" @
@ be wailing for them.

7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude
@of.

7:13 For the seller @ not return to that @ is sold, although
they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude
@of, @ @ not return; @" @ any strengthen @9
in the iniquity of his life.

7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude @of.

7:15 The @Q is @S, and the pestilence and the famine within:
he that is in the field @ die with the @Q; and he that is in
the city, famine and pestilence @ devour him.

7:16 But they that escape of them @ escape, and @ be on the
mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, @ one
for his iniquity.

7:17 All @D @ be feeble, and all knees @ be weak as @Z.

7:18 They @ also gird @T with sackcloth, and horror @
cover them; and shame @ be upon all faces, and baldness upon all
@ heads.

7:19 They @ cast @ silver in the streets, and @ gold @
be removed: @ silver and @ gold @ not be able to deliver
them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they @ not satisfy @
souls, @" fill @ bowels: @ it is the stumblingblock of
@ iniquity.

7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
made the images of @ abominations and of @ detestable @
@in: @fore have I set it far from them.

7:21 And I will give it into the @D of the strangers for a prey,
and to the wicked of the @ for a spoil; and they @ pollute it.

7:22 My face will I turn also from them, and they @ pollute my
secret @': for the robbers @ enter into it, and defile it.

7:23 Make a chain: for the land is full of @Iy crimes, and the city
is full of violence.

7:24 Wherefore I will @( the worst of the heathen, and they @
possess @ @s: I will also make the pomp of the strong to
cease; and @ holy @'s @ be defiled.

7:25 Destruction cometh; and they @ seek @U, and @ @ be
none.

7:26 Mischief @ come upon mischief, and rumour @ be upon
rumour; then @ they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law
@ perish from the @6, and counsel from the ancients.

7:27 The king @ mourn, and the prince @ be clothed with
desolation, and the @D of the @ of the land @ be troubled:
I will do unto them @ @ way, and @$ to @ deserts
will I judge them; and they @ know that I am the LORD.

8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine @, and the elders of
@ sat @	 me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell @ upon me.

8:2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from
the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins
even upward, as the appearance of b@cness, as the colour of amber.

8:3 And he put @ the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the @ and the
@1, and @ me in the visions of God to @ , to the door
of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of
the image of jealousy, @ provoketh to jealousy.

8:4 And, @%, the @Y of the God of @ was @, @$
to the vision that I saw in the plain.

8:5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up @ eyes now the way
toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north,
and @% northward at the gate of the @\ this image of jealousy
in the entry.

8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?
even the @ abominations that the @ of @ committeth here,
that I @# go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet @*,
and thou @ see @er abominations.

8:7 And he @ me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
@% a hole in the wall.

8:8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I
had digged in the wall, @% a door.

8:9 And he said unto me, Go in, and @% the wicked abominations
that they do here.

8:10 So I went in and saw; and @% @ form of creeping @,
and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the @ of @,
pourtrayed upon the wall round @+.

8:11 And @ stood @	 them @Hty men of the ancients of the
@ of @, and in the @a of them stood Jaazaniah the son of
Shaphan, with @ man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of
incense went up.

8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ancients of the @ of @ do in the dark, @ man in the
chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD
hath forsaken the @.

8:13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet @*, and thou @ see
@er abominations that they do.

8:14 Then he @ me to the door of the gate of the LORD's @
@ was toward the north; and, @%, @ sat women weeping for
Tammuz.

8:15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
thee yet @*, and thou @ see @er abominations than @.

8:16 And he @ me into the inner court of the LORD's @, and,
@%, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and
the @\, were @+ five and twenty men, with @ backs toward the
temple of the LORD, and @ faces toward the east; and they
worshipped the sun toward the east.

8:17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a
light @7 to the @ of @ that they commit the abominations
@ they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence,
and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch
to @ nose.

8:18 @N will I also deal in fury: mine eye @ not spare,
@" will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
@;, yet will I not hear them.

9:1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud @;, @, Cause them
that have charge over the city to draw near, even @ man with his
destroying weapon in his hand.

9:2 And, @%, six men came from the way of the higher gate, @
lieth toward the north, and @ man a slaughter weapon in his hand;
and one man @ them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn
by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen @\.

9:3 And the @Y of the God of @ was gone up from the cherub,
whereupon he was, to the threshold of the @. And he @, to the
man clothed with linen, @ had the writer's inkhorn by his side;
9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go @E the @a of the city,
@E the @a of @ , and set a mark upon the foreheads of
the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done
in the @a @of.

9:5 And to the @Cs he said in mine hearing, Go ye @ him @E
the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, @" have ye pity: 9:6
Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little @, and
women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at
my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men @ were @	 the
@.

9:7 And he said unto them, Defile the @, and fill the courts with
the slain: go ye @. And they went @, and slew in the city.

9:8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou
destroy all the residue of @ in thy pouring out of thy fury upon
@ ?  9:9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the @ of
@ and @ is exceeding @, and the land is full of @I,
and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath
forsaken the @, and the LORD seeth not.

9:10 And as for me also, mine eye @ not spare, @" will I have
pity, but I will recompense @ way upon @ head.

9:11 And, @%, the man clothed with linen, @ had the inkhorn by
his side, reported the matter, @, I have done as thou hast
@M me.

10:1 Then I looked, and, @%, in the firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims @ appeared over them as it were a sapphire
stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

10:2 And he @0 unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
between the wheels, even @[ the cherub, and fill @ hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the
city. And he went in in my sight.

10:3 Now the cherubims stood on the @c side of the @, when the
man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

10:4 Then the @Y of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
over the threshold of the @; and the @ was filled with the
cloud, and the court was full of the b@cness of the LORD's @Y.

10:5 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was @) even to the outer
court, as the @; of the Al@By God when he @Keth.

10:6 And it came to pass, that when he had @M the man clothed
with linen, @, Take fire from between the wheels, from between
the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

10:7 And one cherub stretched @ his hand from between the
cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took
@of, and put it into the @D of him that was clothed with linen:
who took it, and went out.

10:8 And @ appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand
@[ @ wings.

10:9 And when I looked, @% the four wheels by the cherubims, one
wheel by one cherub, and @F wheel by @F cherub: and the
appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.

10:10 And as for @ appearances, they four had one likeness, as if
a wheel had been in the @a of a wheel.

10:11 When they went, they went upon @ four sides; they turned not
as they went, but to the @' whither the head looked they followed
it; they turned not as they went.

10:12 And @ whole body, and @ backs, and @ @D, and
@ wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round @+, even the
wheels that they four had.

10:13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
wheel.

10:14 And @ one had four faces: the @O face was the face of a
cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the
face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

10:15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
that I saw by the river of Chebar.

10:16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
the cherubims lifted up @ wings to mount up from the @, the
same wheels also turned not from beside them.

10:17 When they stood, @ stood; and when they were lifted up,
@ lifted up @T also: for the spirit of the living creature
was in them.

10:18 Then the @Y of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
the @, and stood over the cherubims.

10:19 And the cherubims lifted up @ wings, and mounted up from the
@ in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside
them, and @ one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's
@; and the @Y of the God of @ was over them above.

10:20 This is the living creature that I saw @[ the God of @
by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.

10:21 Every one had four faces apiece, and @ one four wings; and
the likeness of the @D of a man was @[ @ wings.

10:22 And the likeness of @ faces was the same faces @ I saw
by the river of Chebar, @ appearances and @T: they went
@ one straight forward.

11:1 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and @ me unto the east
gate of the LORD's @, @ looketh eastward: and @% at the
door of the gate five and twenty men; @ whom I saw Jaazaniah the
son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the @.

11:2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, @ are the men that devise
mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 11:3 Which say, It is
not near; let us build @s: this city is the caldron, and we be the
@R.

11:4 @N prophesy @
 them, prophesy, O son of man.

11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
Thus @
 the LORD; Thus have ye said, O @ of @: for I know
the @ that come into your mind, @ one of them.

11:6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
the streets @of with the slain.

11:7 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid
in the @a of it, they are the @R, and this city is the caldron:
but I will @( you @ out of the @a of it.

11:8 Ye have feared the @Q; and I will @( a @Q upon you,
@
 the Lord GOD.

11:9 And I will @( you out of the @a @of, and deliver you
into the @D of strangers, and will execute judgments @ you.

11:10 Ye @ fall by the @Q; I will judge you in the border of
@; and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

11:11 This city @ not be your caldron, @" @ ye be the
@R in the @a @of; but I will judge you in the border of
@: 11:12 And ye @ know that I am the LORD: for ye have not
walked in my statutes, @" executed my judgments, but have done
@ the manners of the heathen that are round @+ you.

11:13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud
@;, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant
of @?  11:14 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @,
11:15 Son of man, thy @3, even thy @3, the men of thy
kindred, and all the @ of @ wholly, are they unto whom the
inhabitants of @  have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us
is this land @= in possession.

11:16 @N say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
them far off @ the heathen, and although I have scattered them
@ the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in
the countries where they @ come.

11:17 @N say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
from the @, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have
been scattered, and I will give you the land of @.

11:18 And they @ come thither, and they @ take away all the
detestable @ @of and all the abominations @of from
thence.

11:19 And I will give them one @, and I will put a new spirit
within you; and I will take the stony @ out of @ @R, and
will give them an @ of @R: 11:20 That they may walk in my
statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they @ be my
@, and I will be @ God.

11:21 But as for them whose @ walketh @ the @ of @
detestable @ and @ abominations, I will recompense @ way
upon @ own heads, @
 the Lord GOD.

11:22 Then did the cherubims lift up @ wings, and the wheels
beside them; and the @Y of the God of @ was over them above.

11:23 And the @Y of the LORD went up from the @a of the city,
and stood upon the mountain @ is on the east side of the city.

11:24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and @ me in a vision by
the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the
vision that I had seen went up from me.

11:25 Then I @0 unto them of the captivity all the @ that the
LORD had shewed me.

12:1 The word of the LORD also came unto me, @, 12:2 Son of man,
thou dwellest in the @a of a rebellious @, @ have eyes to
see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a
rebellious @.

12:3 @N, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
remove by day in @ sight; and thou @ remove from thy @' to
@F @' in @ sight: it may be they will consider, though
they be a rebellious @.

12:4 Then @ thou @( @ thy stuff by day in @ sight, as
stuff for removing: and thou @ go @ at even in @ sight, as
they that go @ into captivity.

12:5 Dig thou @E the wall in @ sight, and carry out @by.

12:6 In @ sight @ thou bear it upon thy @#ers, and carry
it @ in the twilight: thou @ cover thy face, that thou see not
the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the @ of @.

12:7 And I did so as I was @M: I @ @ my stuff by day,
as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged @E the wall with
mine hand; I @ it @ in the twilight, and I bare it upon my
@#er in @ sight.

12:8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, @,
12:9 Son of man, hath not the @ of @, the rebellious @,
said unto thee, What doest thou?  12:10 Say thou unto them, Thus @

the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in @ , and all
the @ of @ that are @ them.

12:11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so @ it be done
unto them: they @ remove and go into captivity.

12:12 And the prince that is @ them @ bear upon his @#er
in the twilight, and @ go @: they @ dig @E the wall
to carry out @by: he @ cover his face, that he see not the

12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he @ be taken in my
snare: and I will @( him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans;
yet @ he not see it, though he @ die @.

12:14 And I will scatter toward @ wind all that are @+ him to

12:15 And they @ know that I am the LORD, when I @ scatter
them @ the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

12:16 But I will leave a few men of them from the @Q, from the
famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all @
abominations @ the heathen whither they come; and they @ know
that I am the LORD.

12:17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, @, 12:18 Son of
man, eat thy @d with quaking, and @b thy @Z with trembling
and with carefulness; 12:19 And say unto the @ of the land, Thus
@
 the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of @ , and of the land of
@; They @ eat @ @d with carefulness, and @b @
@Z with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that

12:20 And the @G that are inhabited @ be laid waste, and the
land @ be desolate; and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

12:21 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 12:22 Son of man,
what is that proverb that ye have in the land of @, @, The
days are prolonged, and @ vision faileth?  12:23 Tell them
@fore, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease,
and they @ no more use it as a proverb in @; but say unto
them, The days are at hand, and the effect of @ vision.

12:24 For @ @ be no more any vain vision nor flattering

12:25 For I am the LORD: I will @K, and the word that I @ @K
@ come to pass; it @ be no more prolonged: for in your days, O
rebellious @, will I say the word, and will perform it, @
 the
Lord GOD.

12:26 Again the word of the LORD came to me, @.

12:27 Son of man, @%, they of the @ of @ say, The vision
that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the
times that are far off.

12:28 @N say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; There @
none of my @5 be prolonged any more, but the word @ I have

 the Lord GOD.

13:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 13:2 Son of man,
prophesy @
 the prophets of @ that prophesy, and say thou
unto them that prophesy out of @ own @s, Hear ye the word of

 the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets,
that follow @ own spirit, and have seen no@7!  13:4 O @,
thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

13:5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, @" made up the hedge for
the @ of @ to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

13:6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, @, The LORD
@
: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made @Cs to
hope that they @L confirm the word.

13:7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
divination, whereas ye say, The LORD @
 it; albeit I have not
spoken?  13:8 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because ye have
spoken vanity, and seen lies, @fore, @%, I am @
 you,
@
 the Lord GOD.

13:9 And mine hand @ be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
that divine lies: they @ not be in the assembly of my @,
@" @ they be written in the writing of the @ of @,
@" @ they enter into the land of @; and ye @ know
that I am the Lord GOD.

13:10 Because, even @ they have seduced my @, @,
Peace; and @ was no @U; and one built up a wall, and, lo,
@Cs daubed it with untempered morter: 13:11 Say unto them @
daub it with untempered morter, that it @ fall: @ @ be an
overflowing shower; and ye, O @ hailstones, @ fall; and a
stormy wind @ rend it.

13:12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, @ it not be said unto you,
Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?  13:13 @N
thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my
fury; and @ @ be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and
@ hailstones in my fury to consume it.

13:14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
untempered morter, and @( it down to the ground, so that the
@Vation @of @ be discovered, and it @ fall, and ye
@ be consumed in the @a @of: and ye @ know that I am
the LORD.

13:15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The
wall is no more, @" they that daubed it; 13:16 To wit, the
prophets of @ @ prophesy concerning @ , and @ see
visions of @U for her, and @ is no @U, @
 the Lord GOD.

13:17 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face @
 the daughters of
thy @, @ prophesy out of @ own @; and prophesy thou
@
 them, 13:18 And say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Woe to the women
that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of
@ stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my @, and
will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?  13:19 And will ye
pollute me @ my @ for handfuls of barley and for pieces of
@d, to slay the souls that @# not die, and to save the souls
alive that @# not live, by your lying to my @ that hear your
lies?  13:20 Wherefore thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I am @

your pillows, wherewith ye @ hunt the souls to make them fly, and
I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the
souls that ye hunt to make them fly.

13:21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my @ out of
your hand, and they @ be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye
@ know that I am the LORD.

13:22 Because with lies ye have made the @ of the @ceous sad,
whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the @D of the wicked,
that he @# not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
13:23 @N ye @ see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
for I will deliver my @ out of your hand: and ye @ know that
I am the LORD.

14:1 Then came certain of the elders of @ unto me, and sat @

14:2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 14:3 Son of man,
@ men have set up @ idols in @ @, and put the

14:5 That I may take the @ of @ in @ own @, @

14:6 @N say unto the @ of @, Thus @
 the Lord GOD;
Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces

14:7 For @ one of the @ of @, or of the stranger that

@
 that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will
cut him off from the @a of my @; and ye @ know that I am
the LORD.

14:9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a @7, I the
LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the @a of my @ @.

14:10 And they @ bear the punishment of @ iniquity: the
punishment of the prophet @ be even as the punishment of him that
seeketh unto him; 14:11 That the @ of @ may go no more astray

but that they may be my @, and I may be @ God, @
 the Lord

14:12 The word of the LORD came @* to me, @, 14:13 Son of man,
when the land sinneth @
 me by trespassing grievously, then will
I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the @d

14:15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass @E the land, and they

14:17 Or if I @( a @Q upon that land, and say, Sword, go @E

14:21 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four

15:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 15:2 Son of man,
what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch @ is
@ the trees of the forest?  15:3 Shall wood be taken @of to do

15:4 @., it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
both the ends of it, and the @a of it is burned. Is it meet for any

much less @ it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath

15:7 And I will set my face @

15:8 And I will make the land desolate, @ they have committed a

16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 16:2 Son of man,
cause @  to know her abominations, 16:3 And say, Thus @
 the
Lord GOD unto @ ; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of
Canaan; thy @ was an Amorite, and thy m@C an Hittite.

16:4 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was
not cut, @" wast thou washed in @Z to supple thee; thou wast
not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

16:5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of @ unto thee, to have
compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
lo@7 of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

16:6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in @ own
@I, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy @I, Live; yea, I said
unto thee when thou wast in thy @I, Live.

16:7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
hast increased and waxen @, and thou art come to excellent
ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and @ hair is grown, whereas
thou wast naked and bare.

16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, @%, thy time
was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
thee, @
 the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.

16:9 Then washed I thee with @Z; yea, I @Ely washed away thy
@I from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

16:10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
badgers' skin, and I girded thee @+ with fine linen, and I covered
thee with silk.

16:11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
@D, and a chain on thy neck.

16:12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in @ ears,
and a beautiful crown upon @ head.

16:13 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was
of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine
flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou
didst prosper into a kingdom.

16:14 And thy renown went @ @ the heathen for thy beauty: for
it was perfect @E my comeliness, @ I had put upon thee, @

the Lord GOD.

16:15 But thou didst trust in @ own beauty, and playedst the
harlot @ of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on
@ one that passed by; his it was.

16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
@'s with divers colours, and playedst the harlot @upon: the

16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my

16:19 My meat also @ I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it @	 them for a sweet

 the Lord GOD.

16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou

devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 16:21 That thou
hast slain my @, and delivered them to cause them to pass
@E the fire for them?  16:22 And in all @ abominations and

16:23 And it came to pass @ all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto

16:25 Thou hast built thy high @' at @ head of the way, and

16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the @-ians thy

provoke me to anger.

16:27 @., @fore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
have diminished @ ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will
of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, @ are
ashamed of thy lewd way.

16:28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, @ thou
wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet
couldest not be satisfied.

16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied @with.

16:30 How weak is @ @, @
 the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
all @ @, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 16:31 In
that thou buildest @ eminent @' in the head of @ way, and
makest @ high @' in @ street; and hast not been as an
harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 16:32 But as a wife that
committeth adultery, @ taketh strangers instead of her husband!
16:33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all

side for thy whoredom.

16:34 And the contrary is in thee from @C women in thy whoredoms,
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou
givest a reward, and no reward is @= unto thee, @fore thou art
contrary.

16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36 Thus @

the Lord GOD; Because thy fil@ss was poured out, and thy nakedness
discovered @E thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the
idols of thy abominations, and by the @I of thy @, @
thou didst give unto them; 16:37 @., @fore I will gather all

hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather
them round @+ @
 thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto
them, that they may see all thy nakedness.

16:38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
@I are judged; and I will give thee @I in fury and jealousy.

16:39 And I will also give thee into @ hand, and they @ throw
down @ eminent @', and @ break down thy high @'s: they
@ strip thee also of thy clothes, and @ take thy fair jewels,

16:40 They @ also @( up a company @

stone thee with stones, and thrust thee @E with @ @Qs.

16:41 And they @ burn @ @s with fire, and execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee
to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also @ give no hire any
more.

16:42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
@ depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more
angry.

16:43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
fretted me in all @ @; @%, @fore I also will
recompense thy way upon @ head, @
 the Lord GOD: and thou @
not commit this lewdness above all @ abominations.

16:44 @., @ one that useth proverbs @ use this proverb
@

16:45 Thou art thy m@C's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
@; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, @ lothed @
husbands and @ @: your m@C was an Hittite, and your

16:46 And @ elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy
@c hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

16:47 Yet hast thou not walked @ @ ways, nor done @ @
abominations: but, as if that were a very little @7, thou wast
corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

16:48 As I live, @
 the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

16:49 @., this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
fulness of @d, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
daughters, @" did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

16:50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination @	 me:
@fore I took them away as I saw good.

16:51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
multiplied @ abominations more than they, and hast justified thy
sisters in all @ abominations @ thou hast done.

16:52 Thou also, @ hast judged thy sisters, bear @ own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they
are more @ceous than thou: yea, be thou con@Ved also, and bear
thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.

16:53 When I @ @( @* @ captivity, the captivity of Sodom
and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,
then will I @( @* the captivity of thy captives in the @a of
them: 16:54 That thou mayest bear @ own shame, and mayest be
con@Ved in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto
them.

16:55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, @ return to @
former estate, and Samaria and her daughters @ return to @
former estate, then thou and thy daughters @ return to your former
estate.

16:56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy @P in the day
of thy pride, 16:57 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the
time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round
@+ her, the daughters of the Philistines, @ despise thee round
@+.

16:58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and @ abominations, @
 the
LORD.

16:59 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
hast done, @ hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

16:60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

16:61 Then thou @ remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
@ receive thy sisters, @ elder and thy younger: and I will
give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

16:62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou @ know
that I am the LORD: 16:63 That thou mayest remember, and be
con@Ved, and never open thy @P any more @ of thy shame,
when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, @

17:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 17:2 Son of man,

Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 17:4 He cropped off
the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he
set it in a city of merchants.

17:5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
fruitful field; he @'d it by @ @Zs, and set it as a willow
tree.

17:6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
branches turned toward him, and the roots @of were @[ him: so
it became a vine, and @ @ branches, and shot @ sprigs.

17:7 There was also @F @ eagle with @ wings and many

shot @ her branches toward him, that he @B @Z it by the
furrows of her plantation.

17:8 It was planted in a good soil by @ @Zs, that it @B
@( @ branches, and that it @B bear fruit, that it @B be a
goodly vine.

17:9 Say thou, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? @ he not
pull up the roots @of, and cut off the fruit @of, that it
wither? it @ wither in all the leaves of her spring, even @S
@ power or many @ to pluck it up by the roots @of.

17:10 Yea, @%, being planted, @ it prosper? @ it not
utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it @ wither in the
furrows where it grew.

17:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 17:12 Say
now to the rebellious @, Know ye not what @ @ mean?  tell
them, @., the king of Babylon is come to @ , and hath taken
the king @of, and the princes @of, and led them with him to
Babylon; 17:13 And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant
with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the @By
of the land: 17:14 That the kingdom @B be base, that it @B not
lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it @B stand.

17:15 But he rebelled @
 him in sending his ambassadors into
@-, that they @B give him horses and much @. Shall he
prosper? @ he escape that doeth such @? or @ he break the
covenant, and be delivered?  17:16 As I live, @
 the Lord GOD,
surely in the @' where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose
oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the
@a of Babylon he @ die.

17:17 Neither @ Pharaoh with his @By army and @ company
make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to
cut off many persons: 17:18 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking
the covenant, when, lo, he had @= his hand, and hath done all @
@, he @ not escape.

17:19 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it
will I recompense upon his own head.

17:20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he @ be taken in my
snare, and I will @( him to Babylon, and will plead with him @
for his trespass that he hath trespassed @
 me.

17:21 And all his fugitives with all his bands @ fall by the
@Q, and they that remain @ be scattered toward all winds: and
ye @ know that I the LORD have spoken it.

17:22 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch
of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of
his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain
and eminent: 17:23 In the mountain of the height of @ will I
plant it: and it @ @( @ boughs, and bear fruit, and be a
goodly cedar: and @[ it @ dwell all fowl of @ wing; in the
shadow of the branches @of @ they dwell.

17:24 And all the trees of the field @ know that I the LORD have
@ down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up
the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD
have spoken and have done it.

18:1 The word of the LORD came unto me @*, @, 18:2 What mean
ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of @, @,
The @s have eaten sour grapes, and the @'s teeth are set
on edge?  18:3 As I live, @
 the Lord GOD, ye @ not have
occasion any more to use this proverb in @.

18:4 @., all souls are mine; as the soul of the @, so also
the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it @ die.

18:5 But if a man be just, and do that @ is lawful and @c, 18:6
And hath not eaten upon the mountains, @" hath lifted up his eyes
to the idols of the @ of @, @" hath defiled his
neighbour's wife, @" hath come near to a menstruous woman, 18:7
And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his
pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath @= his @d to the
hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 18:8 He that hath
not @= @ upon usury, @" hath taken any increase, that hath
withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between
man and man, 18:9 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my
judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he @ surely live, @
 the
Lord GOD.

18:10 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of @I, and that
doeth the like to any one of @ @, 18:11 And that doeth not
any of @J duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and
defiled his neighbour's wife, 18:12 Hath oppressed the poor and needy,
hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath
lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 18:13
Hath @= @ upon usury, and hath taken increase: @ he then
live? he @ not live: he hath done all @ abominations; he @
surely die; his @I @ be upon him.

18:14 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his @'s sins
@ he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 18:15
That hath not eaten upon the mountains, @" hath lifted up his
eyes to the idols of the @ of @, hath not defiled his
neighbour's wife, 18:16 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not
withholden the pledge, @" hath spoiled by violence, but hath
@= his @d to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a
garment, 18:17 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath
not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
walked in my statutes; he @ not die for the iniquity of his
@, he @ surely live.

18:18 As for his @, @ he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
@X by violence, and did that @ is not good @ his @,
lo, even he @ die in his iniquity.

18:19 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
@?  When the son hath done that @ is lawful and @c, and
hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he @ surely live.

18:20 The soul that sinneth, it @ die. The son @ not bear the
iniquity of the @, @" @ the @ bear the iniquity of
the son: the @ceousness of the @ceous @ be upon him, and the
wickedness of the wicked @ be upon him.

18:21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that @ is lawful and
@c, he @ surely live, he @ not die.

18:22 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they @ not be
mentioned unto him: in his @ceousness that he hath done he @
live.

18:23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked @# die? @
 the
Lord GOD: and not that he @# return from his ways, and live?
18:24 But when the @ceous turneth away from his @ceousness, and
committeth iniquity, and doeth @$ to all the abominations that
the wicked man doeth, @ he live? All his @ceousness that he
hath done @ not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them @ he die.

18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O @
of @; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?  18:26 When
a @ceous man turneth away from his @ceousness, and committeth
iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done @
he die.

18:27 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that
he hath committed, and doeth that @ is lawful and @c, he @
save his soul alive.

18:28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
transgressions that he hath committed, he @ surely live, he @
not die.

18:29 Yet @
 the @ of @, The way of the LORD is not equal.
O @ of @, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
18:30 @N I will judge you, O @ of @, @ one
@$ to his ways, @
 the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves
from all your transgressions; so iniquity @ not be your ruin.

18:31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
transgressed; and make you a new @ and a new spirit: for why will
ye die, O @ of @?  18:32 For I have no pleasure in the @^
of him that dieth, @
 the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and
live ye.

19:1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of @,
19:2 And say, What is thy m@C? A lioness: she lay down @ lions,
she nourished her whelps @ young lions.

19:3 And she @ up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and
it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

19:4 The nations also @) of him; he was taken in @ pit, and
they @ him with chains unto the land of @-.

19:5 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then
she took @F of her whelps, and made him a young lion.

19:6 And he went up and down @ the lions, he became a young lion,
and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

19:7 And he knew @ desolate palaces, and he laid waste @
@G; and the land was desolate, and the fulness @of, by the
noise of his roaring.

19:8 Then the nations set @
 him on @ side from the
provinces, and spread @ net over him: he was taken in @ pit.

19:9 And they put him in ward in chains, and @ him to the king
of Babylon: they @ him into holds, that his @; @# no more
be @) upon the mountains of @.

19:10 Thy m@C is like a vine in thy @I, planted by the @Zs:
she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many @Zs.

19:11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
and her stature was exalted @ the thick branches, and she appeared
in her height with the multitude of her branches.

19:12 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and
wi@d; the fire consumed them.

19:13 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
ground.

19:14 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, @ hath
devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to
rule. This is a lamentation, and @ be for a lamentation.

20:1 And it came to pass in the @Hth year, in the fifth month, the
tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of @ came to
enquire of the LORD, and sat @	 me.

20:2 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, @, 20:3 Son of man,
@K unto the elders of @, and say unto them, Thus @
 the
Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, @
 the Lord GOD,
I will not be enquired of by you.

20:4 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
them to know the abominations of @ @s: 20:5 And say unto
them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose @, and
lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the @ of @], and made
myself known unto them in the land of @-, when I lifted up mine
hand unto them, @, I am the LORD your God; 20:6 In the day that I
lifted up mine hand unto them, to @( them @ of the land of
@- into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and
honey, @ is the @Y of all lands: 20:7 Then said I unto them,
Cast ye away @ man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not
yourselves with the idols of @-: I am the LORD your God.

20:8 But they rebelled @
 me, and @L not hearken unto me: they
did not @ man cast away the abominations of @ eyes, @"
did they forsake the idols of @-: then I said, I will pour out my
fury upon them, to accomplish my anger @
 them in the @a of
the land of @-.

20:9 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it @# not be polluted
@	 the heathen, @ whom they were, in whose sight I made myself
known unto them, in @(ing them @ out of the land of @-.

20:10 Wherefore I caused them to go @ out of the land of @-,
and @ them into the wilderness.

20:11 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, @
if a man do, he @ even live in them.

20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
and them, that they @B know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.

20:13 But the @ of @ rebelled @
 me in the wilderness:
they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, @
if a man do, he @ even live in them; and my sabbaths they @ly
polluted: then I said, I @L pour out my fury upon them in the
wilderness, to consume them.

20:14 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it @# not be polluted
@	 the heathen, in whose sight I @ them out.

20:15 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
@L not @( them into the land @ I had @= them, flowing
with milk and honey, @ is the @Y of all lands; 20:16 Because
they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but
polluted my sabbaths: for @ @ went @ @ idols.

20:17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, @"
did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

20:18 But I said unto @ @ in the wilderness, Walk ye not in
the statutes of your @s, @" observe @ judgments, nor
defile yourselves with @ idols: 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk
in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; 20:20 And hallow
my sabbaths; and they @ be a sign between me and you, that ye may
know that I am the LORD your God.

20:21 Notwithstanding the @ rebelled @
 me: they walked
not in my statutes, @" kept my judgments to do them, @ if a
man do, he @ even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I
said, I @L pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger
@
 them in the wilderness.

20:22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's
sake, that it @# not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in
whose sight I @ them @.

20:23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
@L scatter them @ the heathen, and disperse them @E the
countries; 20:24 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had
despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and @ eyes
were @ @ @s' idols.

20:25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
judgments whereby they @# not live; 20:26 And I polluted them in
@ own gifts, in that they caused to pass @E the fire all that
openeth the womb, that I @B make them desolate, to the end that
they @B know that I am the LORD.

20:27 @N, son of man, @K unto the @ of @, and say
unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Yet in this your @s have
blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass @
 me.

20:28 For when I had @ them into the land, for the @ I
lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw @ high hill,
and all the thick trees, and they offered @ @ sacrifices, and
@ they presented the provocation of @ @&: @ also
they made @ sweet savour, and poured out @ @ @b
@&s.

20:29 Then I said unto them, What is the high @' whereunto ye go?
And the name whereof is @, Bamah unto this day.

20:30 Wherefore say unto the @ of @, Thus @
 the Lord GOD;
Are ye polluted @ the manner of your @s? and commit ye
whoredom @ @ abominations?  20:31 For when ye offer your
gifts, when ye make your sons to pass @E the fire, ye pollute
yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and @ I be
enquired of by you, O @ of @? As I live, @
 the Lord GOD,
I will not be enquired of by you.

20:32 And that @ cometh into your mind @ not be at all, that
ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries,
to serve wood and stone.

20:33 As I live, @
 the Lord GOD, surely with a @By hand, and
with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over
you: 20:34 And I will @( you out from the @, and will gather
you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a @By hand,
and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

20:35 And I will @( you into the wilderness of the @, and
@ will I plead with you face to face.

20:36 Like as I pleaded with your @s in the wilderness of the
land of @-, so will I plead with you, @
 the Lord GOD.

20:37 And I will cause you to pass @[ the rod, and I will @( you
into the bond of the covenant: 20:38 And I will purge out from @
you the rebels, and them that transgress @
 me: I will @( them
@ out of the country where they sojourn, and they @ not enter
into the land of @: and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

20:39 As for you, O @ of @, thus @
 the Lord GOD; Go ye,
serve ye @ one his idols, and here@ also, if ye will not
hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts,
and with your idols.

20:40 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
@, @
 the Lord GOD, @ @ all the @ of @, all
of them in the land, serve me: @ will I accept them, and @
will I require your @&s, and the @Ofruits of your oblations,
with all your holy @.

20:41 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I @( you out
from the @, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have
been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you @	 the heathen.

20:42 And ye @ know that I am the LORD, when I @ @( you
into the land of @, into the country for the @ I lifted up
mine hand to give it to your @s.

20:43 And @ @ ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
wherein ye have been defiled; and ye @ lothe yourselves in your
own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

20:44 And ye @ know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
you for my name's sake, not @$ to your wicked ways, nor
@$ to your corrupt doings, O ye @ of @, @
 the Lord
GOD.

20:45 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 20:46 Son of
man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the
south, and prophesy @
 the forest of the south field; 20:47 And
say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus @

the Lord GOD; @., I will kindle a fire in thee, and it @
devour @ green tree in thee, and @ dry tree: the flaming flame
@ not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north @
be burned @in.

20:48 And all @R @ see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
@ not be quenched.

20:49 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not @K
parables?  21:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 21:2
Son of man, set thy face toward @ , and drop thy word toward
the holy @'s, and prophesy @
 the land of @, 21:3 And say
to the land of @, Thus @
 the LORD; @., I am @
 thee,
and will draw @ my @Q out of his sheath, and will cut off from
thee the @ceous and the wicked.

21:4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the @ceous and the
wicked, @fore @ my @Q go @ out of his sheath @

all @R from the south to the north: 21:5 That all @R may know
that I the LORD have drawn @ my @Q out of his sheath: it @
not return any more.

21:6 Sigh @fore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;
and with bitterness sigh @	 @ eyes.

21:7 And it @ be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
that thou @ answer, For the tidings; @ it cometh: and @
@ @ melt, and all @D @ be feeble, and @ spirit
@ faint, and all knees @ be weak as @Z: @%, it cometh,
and @ be @ to pass, @
 the Lord GOD.

21:8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 21:9 Son of man,
prophesy, and say, Thus @
 the LORD; Say, A @Q, a @Q is
sharpened, and also furbished: 21:10 It is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: @# we then make
mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as @ tree.

21:11 And he hath @= it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
this @Q is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand
of the slayer.

21:12 Cry and howl, son of man: for it @ be upon my @, it
@ be upon all the princes of @: terrors by reason of the
@Q @ be upon my @: smite @fore upon thy thigh.

21:13 Because it is a trial, and what if the @Q contemn even the
rod?  it @ be no more, @
 the Lord GOD.

21:14 Thou @fore, son of man, prophesy, and smite @ @D
@?. and let the @Q be doubled the third time, the @Q of
the slain: it is the @Q of the @ men that are slain, @
entereth into @ privy chambers.

21:15 I have set the point of the @Q @
 all @ gates, that
@ @ may faint, and @ ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made
b@c, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

21:16 Go thee one way or @C, either on the @c hand, or on the
left, whithersoever thy face is set.

21:17 I will also smite mine @D @?, and I will cause my fury
to rest: I the LORD have said it.

21:18 The word of the LORD came unto me @*, @, 21:19 Also,
thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the @Q of the king of
Babylon may come: both twain @ come @ out of one land: and
choose thou a @', choose it at the head of the way to the city.

21:20 Appoint a way, that the @Q may come to Rabbath of the
Ammonites, and to @ in @  the defenced.

21:21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the
head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows b@c, he
consulted with images, he looked in the liver.

21:22 At his @c hand was the divination for @ , to appoint
captains, to open the @P in the slaughter, to lift up the @;
with shouting, to appoint battering rams @
 the gates, to cast a
mount, and to build a fort.

21:23 And it @ be unto them as a false divination in @ sight,
to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the
iniquity, that they may be taken.

21:24 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered,
so that in all your doings your sins do appear; @, I say, that
ye are come to remembrance, ye @ be taken with the hand.

21:25 And thou, profane wicked prince of @, whose day is come,
when iniquity @ have an end, 21:26 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Remove
the diadem, and take off the crown: this @ not be the same: exalt
him that is low, and abase him that is high.

21:27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it @ be no
more, until he come whose @c it is; and I will give it him.

21:28 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD
concerning the Ammonites, and concerning @ reproach; even say
thou, The @Q, the @Q is drawn: for the slaughter it is
furbished, to consume @ of the glittering: 21:29 Whiles they see
vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to @( thee
upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is
come, when @ iniquity @ have an end.

21:30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in
the @' where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.

21:31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
@
 thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand
of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

21:32 Thou @ be for fuel to the fire; thy @I @ be in the
@a of the land; thou @ be no more remembered: for I the LORD
have spoken it.

22:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 22:2 Now,
thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the @Iy city?
yea, thou @ shew her all her abominations.

22:3 Then say thou, Thus @
 the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth @I
in the @a of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols @

herself to defile herself.

22:4 Thou art become guilty in thy @I that thou hast shed; and hast
defiled thyself in @ idols @ thou hast made; and thou hast
caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy @8:
@fore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking

22:5 Those that be near, and @J that be far from thee, @ mock
thee, @ art infamous and much vexed.

22:6 @., the princes of @, @ one were in thee to @
power to shed @I.

22:7 In thee have they set light by @ and m@C: in the @a of
thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have
they vexed the @less and the widow.

22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy @, and hast profaned my
sabbaths.

22:9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed @I: and in thee they
eat upon the mountains: in the @a of thee they commit lewdness.

22:10 In thee have they discovered @ @s' nakedness: in thee
have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

22:11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife;
and @F hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and @F in
thee hath humbled his sister, his @'s daughter.

22:12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed @I; thou hast taken
usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
extortion, and hast forgotten me, @
 the Lord GOD.

22:13 @., @fore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
@ thou hast made, and at thy @I @ hath been in the @a of
thee.

22:14 Can @ @ endure, or can @ @D be strong, in the
days that I @ deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will
do it.

22:15 And I will scatter thee @ the heathen, and disperse thee in
the countries, and will consume thy fil@ss out of thee.

22:16 And thou @ take @ inheritance in thyself in the sight of
the heathen, and thou @ know that I am the LORD.

22:17 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 22:18 Son of man,
the @ of @ is to me become dross: all they are brass, and
tin, and iron, and lead, in the @a of the furnace; they are even
the dross of silver.

22:19 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
dross, @%, @fore I will gather you into the @a of
@ .

22:20 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
into the @a of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;
so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave
you @, and melt you.

22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
wrath, and ye @ be melted in the @a therof.

22:22 As silver is melted in the @a of the furnace, so @ ye be
melted in the @a @of; and ye @ know that I the LORD have
poured out my fury upon you.

22:23 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 22:24 Son of man,
say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon
in the day of indignation.

22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the @a @of, like
a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have
taken the treasure and precious @; they have made her many widows
in the @a @of.

22:26 Her @6s have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
@: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,
@" have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean,
and have hid @ eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned @
them.

22:27 Her princes in the @a @of are like wolves ravening the
prey, to shed @I, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing
vanity, and divining lies unto them, @, Thus @
 the Lord GOD,
when the LORD hath not spoken.

22:29 The @ of the land have used oppression, and exercised
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed
the stranger wrongfully.

22:30 And I sought for a man @ them, that @# make up the
hedge, and stand in the gap @	 me for the land, that I @# not
destroy it: but I @V none.

22:31 @N have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: @ own way have I
recompensed upon @ heads, @
 the Lord GOD.

23:1 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 23:2 Son of man,
@ were two women, the daughters of one m@C: 23:3 And they
committed whoredoms in @-; they committed whoredoms in @ youth:
@ were @ breasts pressed, and @ they bruised the teats of
@ virginity.

23:4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus
were @ names; Samaria is Aholah, and @  Aholibah.

23:5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on
her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 23:6 Which were clothed
with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men,
horsemen riding upon horses.

23:7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with
all @ idols she defiled herself.

23:8 Neither left she her whoredoms @ from @-: for in her
youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her
virginity, and poured @ whoredom upon her.

23:9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into
the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

23:10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
daughters, and slew her with the @Q: and she became famous @
women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

23:11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her
sister in her whoredoms.

23:12 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them
desirable young men.

23:13 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
23:14 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with
vermilion, 23:15 Girded with girdles upon @ loins, exceeding in
dyed attire upon @ heads, all of them princes to look to, @
the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of @ nativity:
23:16 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,
and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
defiled her with @ whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and
her mind was alienated from them.

23:18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated
from her sister.

23:19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the
days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of
@-.

23:20 For she doted upon @ paramours, whose @R is as the @R
of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

23:21 Thus thou @,st to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
bruising thy teats by the @-ians for the paps of thy youth.

23:22 @N, O Aholibah, thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will
raise up thy lovers @
 thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and
I will @( them @
 thee on @ side; 23:23 The Babylonians,
and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians
with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, @
lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.

23:24 And they @ come @
 thee with chariots, wagons, and
wheels, and with an assembly of @, @ @ set @
 thee
buckler and shield and helmet round @+: and I will set judgment
@	 them, and they @ judge thee @$ to @ judgments.

23:25 And I will set my jealousy @
 thee, and they @ deal
furiously with thee: they @ take away thy nose and @ ears; and
thy remnant @ fall by the @Q: they @ take thy sons and thy
daughters; and thy residue @ be devoured by the fire.

23:26 They @ also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy
fair jewels.

23:27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
whoredom @ from the land of @-: so that thou @ not lift
up @ eyes unto them, nor remember @- any more.

23:28 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will deliver thee into
the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy
mind is alienated: 23:29 And they @ deal with thee hatefully, and
@ take away all thy labour, and @ leave thee naked and bare:
and the nakedness of thy whoredoms @ be discovered, both thy
lewdness and thy whoredoms.

23:30 I will do @ @ unto thee, @ thou hast gone a
whoring @ the heathen, and @ thou art polluted with @
idols.

23:31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; @fore will I give
her cup into @ hand.

23:32 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Thou @ @b of thy sister's cup
deep and large: thou @ be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it
containeth much.

23:33 Thou @ be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

23:34 Thou @ even @b it and suck it out, and thou @ break
the sherds @of, and pluck off @ own breasts: for I have spoken
it, @
 the Lord GOD.

23:35 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
me, and cast me behind thy back, @fore bear thou also thy lewdness
and thy whoredoms.

23:36 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them @ abominations; 23:37
That they have committed adultery, and @I is in @ @D, and
with @ idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused
@ sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them @E the fire,
to devour them.

23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

23:39 For when they had slain @ @ to @ idols, then they
came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have
they done in the @a of mine @.

23:40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou
didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with
ornaments, 23:41 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared
@	 it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

23:42 And a @; of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with
the men of the common sort were @ Sabeans from the wilderness,
@ put bracelets upon @ @D, and beautiful crowns upon @
heads.

23:43 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  23:44 Yet they went in
unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went
they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.

23:45 And the @ceous men, they @ judge them @ the manner of
adulteresses, and @ the manner of women that shed @I; @
they are adulteresses, and @I is in @ @D.

23:46 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will @( up a company upon
them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

23:47 And the company @ stone them with stones, and dispatch them
with @ @Qs; they @ slay @ sons and @ daughters, and
burn up @ @s with fire.

23:48 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
women may be taught not to do @ your lewdness.

23:49 And they @ recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye @
bear the sins of your idols: and ye @ know that I am the Lord GOD.

24:1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 24:2 Son of man,
write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of
Babylon set @9 @
 @  this same day.

24:3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious @, and say unto them,
Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour @Z
into it: 24:4 Gather the pieces @of into it, even @ good
piece, the thigh, and the @#er; fill it with the choice bones.

24:5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones @[ it,
and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it @in.

24:6 Wherefore thus @
 the Lord GOD; Woe to the @Iy city, to the
pot whose scum is @in, and whose scum is not gone out of it! @(
it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

24:7 For her @I is in the @a of her; she set it upon the top of
a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 24:8
That it @B cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her
@I upon the top of a rock, that it @# not be covered.

24:9 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Woe to the @Iy city! I will
even make the pile for fire @.

24:10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the @R, and spice it
well, and let the bones be burned.

24:11 Then set it empty upon the coals @of, that the brass of it
may be hot, and may burn, and that the fil@ss of it may be molten
in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

24:12 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her @ scum went not
@ out of her: her scum @ be in the fire.

24:13 In thy fil@ss is lewdness: @ I have purged thee, and
thou wast not purged, thou @ not be purged from thy fil@ss any
more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.

24:14 I the LORD have spoken it: it @ come to pass, and I will do
it; I will not go back, @" will I spare, @" will I repent;
@$ to thy ways, and @$ to thy doings, @ they judge
thee, @
 the Lord GOD.

24:15 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 24:16 Son of
man, @%, I take away from thee the desire of @ eyes with a
stroke: yet @" @ thou mourn nor weep, @" @ thy tears
run down.

24:17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of
@ head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover
not thy lips, and eat not the @d of men.

24:18 So I @0 unto the @ in the morning: and at even my wife
died; and I did in the morning as I was @M.

24:19 And the @ said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what @
@ are to us, that thou doest so?  24:20 Then I @> them, The
word of the LORD came unto me, @, 24:21 Speak unto the @ of
@, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will profane my sanctuary,
the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that
@ your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have
left @ fall by the @Q.

24:22 And ye @ do as I have done: ye @ not cover your lips,
nor eat the @d of men.

24:23 And your tires @ be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
your feet: ye @ not mourn nor weep; but ye @ pine away for
your iniquities, and mourn one toward @F.

24:24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: @$ to all that he hath
done @ ye do: and when this cometh, ye @ know that I am the
Lord GOD.

24:25 Also, thou son of man, @ it not be in the day when I take
from them @ strength, the joy of @ @Y, the desire of @
eyes, and that whereupon they set @ minds, @ sons and @
daughters, 24:26 That he that escapeth in that day @ come unto
thee, to cause thee to hear it with @ ears?  24:27 In that day
@ thy @P be opened to him @ is escaped, and thou @
@K, and be no more dumb: and thou @ be a sign unto them; and
they @ know that I am the LORD.

25:1 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 25:2 Son of man,
set thy face @
 the Ammonites, and prophesy @
 them; 25:3
And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus @

the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, @
 my sanctuary, when it
was profaned; and @
 the land of @, when it was desolate;
and @
 the @ of @, when they went into captivity; 25:4
@., @fore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a
possession, and they @ set @ palaces in thee, and make @
dwellings in thee: they @ eat thy fruit, and they @ @b thy
milk.

25:5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
couching @' for flocks: and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

25:6 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped @
@D, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in @ with all thy
despite @
 the land of @; 25:7 @., @fore I will
stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to
the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the @, and I will cause
thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou
@ know that I am the LORD.

25:8 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
@., the @ of @ is like unto all the heathen; 25:9
@N, @%, I will open the side of Moab from the @G, from
his @G @ are on his frontiers, the @Y of the country,
Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim, 25:10 Unto the men of the
east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the
Ammonites may not be remembered @ the nations.

25:11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they @ know that
I am the LORD.

25:12 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt @

the @ of @ by taking vengeance, and hath @ly offended, and
revenged @9 upon them; 25:13 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; I
will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and
beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of
Dedan @ fall by the @Q.

25:14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my @
@: and they @ do in Edom @$ to mine anger and
@$ to my fury; and they @ know my vengeance, @
 the Lord
GOD.

25:15 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful @, to destroy
it for the old hatred; 25:16 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD;
@., I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will
cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

25:17 And I will execute @ vengeance upon them with furious
rebukes; and they @ know that I am the LORD, when I @ lay my
vengeance upon them.

26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the @O day of the
month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 26:2 Son of
man, @ that Tyrus hath said @
 @ , Aha, she is
broken that was the gates of the @: she is turned unto me: I
@ be replenished, now she is laid waste: 26:3 @N thus @

the Lord GOD; @., I am @
 thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many
nations to come up @
 thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come
up.

26:4 And they @ destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the
top of a rock.

26:5 It @ be a @' for the spreading of nets in the @a of the
sea: for I have spoken it, @
 the Lord GOD: and it @ become a
spoil to the nations.

26:6 And her daughters @ are in the field @ be slain by the
@Q; and they @ know that I am the LORD.

26:7 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will @( upon Tyrus
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with
horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much
@.

26:8 He @ slay with the @Q thy daughters in the field: and he
@ make a fort @
 thee, and cast a mount @
 thee, and
lift up the buckler @
 thee.

26:9 And he @ set engines of war @
 thy walls, and with his
axes he @ break down thy towers.

26:10 By reason of the abundance of his horses @ dust @ cover
thee: thy walls @ shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the
wheels, and of the chariots, when he @ enter into thy gates, as
men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.

26:11 With the hoofs of his horses @ he tread down all thy
streets: he @ slay thy @ by the @Q, and thy strong
garrisons @ go down to the ground.

26:12 And they @ make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
thy merchandise: and they @ break down thy walls, and destroy thy
pleasant @s: and they @ lay thy stones and thy timber and thy
dust in the @a of the @Z.

26:13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound
of thy harps @ be no more @).

26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou @ be a
@' to spread nets upon; thou @ be built no more: for I the LORD
have spoken it, @
 the Lord GOD.

26:15 Thus @
 the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is
made in the @a of thee?  26:16 Then all the princes of the sea
@ come down from @ thrones, and lay away @ robes, and put
off @ broidered garments: they @ clothe @T with
trembling; they @ sit upon the ground, and @ tremble at @
moment, and be astonished at thee.

26:17 And they @ take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,
How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the
renowned city, @ wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants,
@ cause @ terror to be on all that haunt it!  26:18 Now @
the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in
the sea @ be troubled at thy departure.

26:19 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; When I @ make thee a desolate
city, like the @G that are not inhabited; when I @ @( up
the deep upon thee, and @ @Zs @ cover thee; 26:20 When I
@ @( thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the
@ of old time, and @ set thee in the low parts of the @,
in @'s desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that
thou be not inhabited; and I @ set @Y in the land of the
living; 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou @ be no more:
though thou be sought for, yet @ thou never be @V @*, @

the Lord GOD.

27:1 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 27:2 Now, thou
son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 27:3 And say unto Tyrus,
O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, @ art a merchant
of the @ for many isles, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou
hast said, I am of perfect beauty.

27:4 Thy borders are in the @a of the seas, thy builders have
perfected thy beauty.

27:5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

27:6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made @ oars; the company of
the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, @ out of the isles
of Chittim.

27:7 Fine linen with broidered work from @- was that @ thou
spreadest @ to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of
Elishah was that @ covered thee.

27:8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

27:9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men @of were in thee thy
calkers: all the ships of the sea with @ mariners were in thee to
occupy thy merchandise.

27:10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in @ army, thy
men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set @
thy comeliness.

27:11 The men of Arvad with @ army were upon thy walls round
@+, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged @ shields
upon thy walls round @+; they have made thy beauty perfect.

27:12 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind
of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded
the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

27:14 They of the @ of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
and horsemen and mules.

27:15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
merchandise of @ hand: they @ thee for a present horns of
ivory and ebony.

27:16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares

broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

27:17 @, and the land of @, they were thy merchants: they
traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil,
and balm.

27:18 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and
white wool.

27:19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
b@c iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

27:20 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

27:21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in
lambs, and rams, and goats: in @ were they thy merchants.

27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they
occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious
stones, and gold.

27:23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and
Chilmad, were thy merchants.

27:24 These were thy merchants in all sorts of @, in blue
clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with
cords, and made of cedar, @ thy merchandise.

27:25 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
wast replenished, and made very glorious in the @a of the seas.

27:26 Thy rowers have @ thee into @ @Zs: the east wind
hath broken thee in the @a of the seas.

27:27 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all
thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company @ is in
the @a of thee, @ fall into the @a of the seas in the day of
thy ruin.

27:28 The suburbs @ shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

27:29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of
the sea, @ come down from @ ships, they @ stand upon the
land; 27:30 And @ cause @ @; to be @) @

@ cry bitterly, and @ cast up dust upon @ heads, they
@ wallow @T in the ashes: 27:31 And they @ make
@T utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and
they @ weep for thee with bitterness of @ and bitter wailing.

27:32 And in @ wailing they @ take up a lamentation for thee,
and lament over thee, @, What city is like Tyrus, like the
destroyed in the @a of the sea?  27:33 When thy wares went @
out of the seas, thou filledst many @; thou didst enrich the
kings of the @ with the multitude of thy riches and of thy
merchandise.

27:34 In the time when thou @ be broken by the seas in the depths
of the @Zs thy merchandise and all thy company in the @a of thee
@ fall.

27:35 All the inhabitants of the isles @ be astonished at thee,

countenance.

27:36 The merchants @ the @ @ hiss at thee; thou @ be
a terror, and never @ be any more.

28:1 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 28:2 Son of man,
say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because @
@ is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat
of God, in the @a of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God,
though thou set @ @ as the @ of God: 28:3 @., thou art
wiser than Daniel; @ is no secret that they can hide from thee:
28:4 With thy wisdom and with @ @[standing thou hast gotten
thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 28:5
By thy @ wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy
riches, and @ @ is lifted up @ of thy riches: 28:6
@N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set @ @
as the @ of God; 28:7 @., @fore I will @( strangers
upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they @ draw @
@Qs @
 the beauty of thy wisdom, and they @ defile thy
b@cness.

28:8 They @ @( thee down to the pit, and thou @ die the
@^s of them that are slain in the @a of the seas.

28:9 Wilt thou yet say @	 him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
thou @ be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.

28:10 Thou @ die the @^s of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers: for I have spoken it, @
 the Lord GOD.

28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 28:12 Son of
man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him,
Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and
perfect in beauty.

28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; @ precious stone
was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the
onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle,
and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared
in thee in the day that thou wast created.

28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and
down in the @a of the stones of fire.

28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created, till iniquity was @V in thee.

28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the @a
of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: @fore I will cast
thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O
covering cherub, from the @a of the stones of fire.

28:17 Thine @ was lifted up @ of thy beauty, thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy b@cness: I will cast thee to
the ground, I will lay thee @	 kings, that they may @% thee.

28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of @
iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; @fore will I @(
@ a fire from the @a of thee, it @ devour thee, and I will
@( thee to ashes upon the @ in the sight of all them that
@% thee.

28:19 All they that know thee @ the @ @ be astonished at
thee: thou @ be a terror, and never @ thou be any more.

28:20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 28:21 Son of
man, set thy face @
 Zidon, and prophesy @
 it, 28:22 And
say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I am @
 thee, O Zidon; and
I will be glorified in the @a of thee: and they @ know that I
am the LORD, when I @ have executed judgments in her, and @ be
sanctified in her.

28:23 For I will send into her pestilence, and @I into her streets;
and the wounded @ be judged in the @a of her by the @Q upon
her on @ side; and they @ know that I am the LORD.

28:24 And @ @ be no more a pricking brier unto the @ of
@, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round @+ them, that
despised them; and they @ know that I am the Lord GOD.

28:25 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; When I @ have ga@d the @ of
@ from the @ @ whom they are scattered, and @ be
sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then @ they dwell
in @ land that I have @= to my @< @].

28:26 And they @ dwell safely @in, and @ build @s, and
plant vineyards; yea, they @ dwell with confidence, when I have
executed judgments upon all @J that despise them round @+ them;
and they @ know that I am the LORD @ God.

29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
month, the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 29:2 Son of man, set
thy face @
 Pharaoh king of @-, and prophesy @
 him, and
@
 all @-: 29:3 Speak, and say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD;
@., I am @
 thee, Pharaoh king of @-, the @ dragon
that lieth in the @a of his rivers, @ hath said, My river is
mine own, and I have made it for myself.

29:4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will @( thee up out of
the @a of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers @ stick
unto thy scales.

29:5 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
the fish of thy rivers: thou @ fall upon the open fields; thou
@ not be @ @?, nor ga@d: I have @= thee for
meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the @1.

29:6 And all the inhabitants of @- @ know that I am the LORD,
@ they have been a staff of reed to the @ of @.

29:7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
rend all @ @#er: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest,
and madest all @ loins to be at a stand.

29:8 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will @( a @Q
upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

29:9 And the land of @- @ be desolate and waste; and they @
know that I am the LORD: @ he hath said, The river is mine, and
I have made it.

29:10 @., @fore I am @
 thee, and @
 thy rivers, and
I will make the land of @- utterly waste and desolate, from the
tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

29:11 No foot of man @ pass @E it, nor foot of beast @
pass @E it, @" @ it be inhabited forty @8.

29:12 And I will make the land of @- desolate in the @a of the
countries that are desolate, and her @G @ the @G that are
laid waste @ be desolate forty @8: and I will scatter the
@-ians @ the nations, and will disperse them @E the
countries.

29:13 Yet thus @
 the Lord GOD; At the end of forty @8 will I
gather the @-ians from the @ whither they were scattered:
29:14 And I will @( @* the captivity of @-, and will cause
them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of @
habitation; and they @ be @ a base kingdom.

29:15 It @ be the basest of the kingdoms; @" @ it exalt
itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they
@ no more rule over the nations.

29:16 And it @ be no more the confidence of the @ of @,
@ @(eth @ iniquity to remembrance, when they @ look
@ them: but they @ know that I am the Lord GOD.

29:17 And it came to pass in the @H and twentieth year, in the
@O month, in the @O day of the month, the word of the LORD came
unto me, @, 29:18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
caused his army to serve a @ service @
 Tyrus: @ head was
made bald, and @ @#er was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his
army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served @
 it: 29:19
@N thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will give the land of
@- unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he @ take her
multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it @ be the
wages for his army.

29:20 I have @= him the land of @- for his labour wherewith he
served @
 it, @ they wrought for me, @
 the Lord GOD.

29:21 In that day will I cause the horn of the @ of @ to bud
@, and I will give thee the opening of the @P in the @a of
them; and they @ know that I am the LORD.

30:1 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 30:2 Son of man,
prophesy and say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!
30:3 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy
day; it @ be the time of the heathen.

30:4 And the @Q @ come upon @-, and @ pain @ be in
Ethiopia, when the slain @ fall in @-, and they @ take away
her multitude, and her @Vations @ be broken down.

30:5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled @, and
Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, @ fall with them
by the @Q.

30:6 Thus @
 the LORD; They also that uphold @- @ fall; and
the pride of her power @ come down: from the tower of Syene @
they fall in it by the @Q, @
 the Lord GOD.

30:7 And they @ be desolate in the @a of the countries that are
desolate, and her @G @ be in the @a of the @G that are
wasted.

30:8 And they @ know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
@-, and when all her helpers @ be destroyed.

30:9 In that day @ messengers go @ from me in ships to make
the careless Ethiopians afraid, and @ pain @ come upon them,
as in the day of @-: for, lo, it cometh.

30:10 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of @-
to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

30:11 He and his @ with him, the terrible of the nations, @
be @ to destroy the land: and they @ draw @ @Qs
@
 @-, and fill the land with the slain.

30:12 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is
@in, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.

30:13 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
will cause @ images to cease out of Noph; and @ @ be no
more a prince of the land of @-: and I will put a fear in the land
of @-.

30:14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
will execute judgments in No.

30:15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of @-; and I
will cut off the multitude of No.

30:16 And I will set fire in @-: Sin @ have @ pain, and No
@ be rent as@[, and Noph @ have distresses daily.

30:17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth @ fall by the @Q:
and @ @G @ go into captivity.

30:18 At Tehaphnehes also the day @ be darkened, when I @
break @ the yokes of @-: and the pomp of her strength @
cease in her: as for her, a cloud @ cover her, and her daughters
@ go into captivity.

30:19 Thus will I execute judgments in @-: and they @ know that
I am the LORD.

30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the @O month, in
the @Hth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
@, 30:21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of
@-; and, lo, it @ not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller
to bind it, to make it strong to hold the @Q.

30:22 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I am @
 Pharaoh
king of @-, and will break his arms, the strong, and that @ was
broken; and I will cause the @Q to fall out of his hand.

30:23 And I will scatter the @-ians @ the nations, and will
disperse them @E the countries.

30:24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
my @Q in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he @
groan @	 him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

30:25 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
arms of Pharaoh @ fall down; and they @ know that I am the
LORD, when I @ put my @Q into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and he @ stretch it out upon the land of @-.

30:26 And I will scatter the @-ians @ the nations, and disperse
them @ the countries; and they @ know that I am the LORD.

31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
the @O day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
@, 31:2 Son of man, @K unto Pharaoh king of @-, and to his
multitude; Whom art thou like in thy @ness?  31:3 @., the
Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a
shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was @ the
thick boughs.

31:4 The @Zs made him @, the deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round @+ his plants, and sent her little rivers unto
all the trees of the field.

31:5 @N his height was exalted above all the trees of the
field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long
@ of the multitude of @Zs, when he shot @.

31:6 All the fowls of @1 made @ nests in his boughs, and @[
his branches did all the beasts of the field @( @ @ young,
and @[ his shadow dwelt all @ nations.

31:7 Thus was he fair in his @ness, in the length of his branches:
for his root was by @ @Zs.

31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his
beauty.

31:9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.

31:10 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top @ the thick boughs,
and his @ is lifted up in his height; 31:11 I have @fore
delivered him into the hand of the @By one of the heathen; he @
surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.

31:12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of
the land; and all the @ of the @ are gone down from his
shadow, and have left him.

31:13 Upon his ruin @ all the fowls of the @1 remain, and all
the beasts of the field @ be upon his branches: 31:14 To the end
that none of all the trees by the @Zs exalt @T for @
height, @" shoot up @ top @ the thick boughs, @"
@ trees stand up in @ height, all that @b @Z: for they
are all delivered unto @^, to the nether parts of the @, in the
@a of the @ of men, with them that go down to the pit.

31:15 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
restrained the floods @of, and the @ @Zs were stayed: and I
caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field
fainted for him.

31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the
trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that @b @Z,
@ be comforted in the nether parts of the @.

31:17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
with the @Q; and they that were his arm, that dwelt @[ his
shadow in the @a of the heathen.

31:18 To whom art thou thus like in @Y and in @ness @ the
trees of Eden? yet @ thou be @ down with the trees of Eden
unto the nether parts of the @: thou @ lie in the @a of the
uncircumcised with them that be slain by the @Q. This is Pharaoh
and all his multitude, @
 the Lord GOD.

32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in
the @O day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
@, 32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of
@-, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,
and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest @ with thy
rivers, and troubledst the @Zs with thy feet, and fouledst @
rivers.

32:3 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will @fore spread out my net over
thee with a company of many @; and they @ @( thee up in my
net.

32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee @ upon
the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the @1 to remain
upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole @ with thee.

32:5 And I will lay thy @R upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
with thy height.

32:6 I will also @Z with thy @I the land wherein thou swimmest,
even to the mountains; and the rivers @ be full of thee.

32:7 And when I @ put thee out, I will cover the @1, and make
the stars @of dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the
moon @ not give her light.

32:8 All the b@c lights of @1 will I make dark over thee, and
set darkness upon thy land, @
 the Lord GOD.

32:9 I will also vex the @s of many @, when I @ @( thy
destruction @ the nations, into the countries @ thou hast not
known.

32:10 Yea, I will make many @ amazed at thee, and @ kings
@ be horribly afraid for thee, when I @ brandish my @Q
@	 them; and they @ tremble at @ moment, @ man for his
own life, in the day of thy fall.

32:11 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; The @Q of the king of Babylon
@ come upon thee.

32:12 By the @Qs of the @By will I cause thy multitude to fall,
the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they @ spoil the
pomp of @-, and all the multitude @of @ be destroyed.

32:13 I will destroy also all the beasts @of from beside the @
@Zs; @" @ the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the
hoofs of beasts trouble them.

32:14 Then will I make @ @Zs deep, and cause @ rivers to
run like oil, @
 the Lord GOD.

32:15 When I @ make the land of @- desolate, and the country
@ be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I @ smite all
them that dwell @in, then @ they know that I am the LORD.

32:16 This is the lamentation wherewith they @ lament her: the
daughters of the nations @ lament her: they @ lament for her,
even for @-, and for all her multitude, @
 the Lord GOD.

32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 32:18
Son of man, wail for the multitude of @-, and cast them down, even
her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of
the @, with them that go down into the pit.

32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
the uncircumcised.

32:20 They @ fall in the @a of them that are slain by the
@Q: she is delivered to the @Q: draw her and all her multitudes.

32:21 The strong @ the @By @ @K to him out of the @a
of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie
uncircumcised, slain by the @Q.

32:22 Asshur is @ and all her company: his graves are @+ him:
all of them slain, fallen by the @Q: 32:23 Whose graves are set in
the sides of the pit, and her company is round @+ her grave: all of
them slain, fallen by the @Q, @ caused terror in the land of
the living.

32:24 There is Elam and all her multitude round @+ her grave, all
of them slain, fallen by the @Q, @ are gone down uncircumcised
into the nether parts of the @, @ caused @ terror in the
land of the living; yet have they borne @ shame with them that go
down to the pit.

32:25 They have set her a bed in the @a of the slain with all her
multitude: her graves are round @+ him: all of them uncircumcised,
slain by the @Q: though @ terror was caused in the land of the
living, yet have they borne @ shame with them that go down to the
pit: he is put in the @a of them that be slain.

32:26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
round @+ him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the @Q, though
they caused @ terror in the land of the living.

32:27 And they @ not lie with the @By that are fallen of the

and they have laid @ @Qs @[ @ heads, but @
iniquities @ be upon @ bones, though they were the terror of

32:28 Yea, thou @ be broken in the @a of the uncircumcised, and
@ lie with them that are slain with the @Q.

32:29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, @ with @

32:30 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
Zidonians, @ are gone down with the slain; with @ terror they
are ashamed of @ @B; and they lie uncircumcised with them that

32:31 Pharaoh @ see them, and @ be comforted over all his

32:32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he

33:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 33:2 Son of man,
@K to the @ of thy @, and say unto them, When I @(
the @Q upon a land, if the @ of the land take a man of @
coasts, and set him for @ watchman: 33:3 If when he seeth the
@Q come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the @;
33:4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
warning; if the @Q come, and take him away, his @I @ be upon
his own head.

33:5 He @) the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
@I @ be upon him. But he that taketh warning @ deliver his
soul.

33:6 But if the watchman see the @Q come, and blow not the trumpet,
and the @ be not warned; if the @Q come, and take any person
from @ them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his @I will
I require at the watchman's hand.

33:7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the @
of @; @fore thou @ hear the word at my @P, and warn
them from me.

33:8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou @ surely die;
if thou dost not @K to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked
man @ die in his iniquity; but his @I will I require at @
hand.

33:9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
if he do not turn from his way, he @ die in his iniquity; but thou
hast delivered thy soul.

33:10 @N, O thou son of man, @K unto the @ of @;
Thus ye @K, @, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us,
and we pine away in them, how @# we then live?  33:11 Say unto
them, As I live, @
 the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the @^
of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn
ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O @ of
@?  33:12 @N, thou son of man, say unto the @ of
thy @, The @ceousness of the @ceous @ not deliver him
in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked,
he @ not fall @by in the day that he turneth from his
wickedness; @" @ the @ceous be able to live for his
@ceousness in the day that he sinneth.

33:13 When I @ say to the @ceous, that he @ surely live; if
he trust to his own @ceousness, and commit iniquity, all his
@ceousnesses @ not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he
hath committed, he @ die for it.

33:14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou @ surely die; if he
turn from his sin, and do that @ is lawful and @c; 33:15 If the
wicked restore the pledge, give @* that he had robbed, walk in the
statutes of life, @S committing iniquity; he @ surely live,
he @ not die.

33:16 None of his sins that he hath committed @ be mentioned unto
him: he hath done that @ is lawful and @c; he @ surely
live.

33:17 Yet the @ of thy @ say, The way of the Lord is not
equal: but as for them, @ way is not equal.

33:18 When the @ceous turneth from his @ceousness, and
committeth iniquity, he @ even die @by.

33:19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that @ is
lawful and @c, he @ live @by.

33:20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye @ of
@, I will judge you @ one @ his ways.

33:21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped
out of @  came unto me, @, The city is smitten.

33:22 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
that was escaped came; and had opened my @P, until he came to me in
the morning; and my @P was opened, and I was no more dumb.

33:23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 33:24 Son of
man, they that inhabit @J wastes of the land of @ @K,
@, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many;
the land is @= us for inheritance.

33:25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
the @I, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed @I:
and @ ye possess the land?  33:26 Ye stand upon your @Q, ye
work abomination, and ye defile @ one his neighbour's wife: and
@ ye possess the land?  33:27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus @

the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes @ fall
by the @Q, and him that is in the open field will I give to the
beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves
@ die of the pestilence.

33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
strength @ cease; and the mountains of @ @ be desolate,
that none @ pass @E.

33:29 Then @ they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
land most desolate @ of all @ abominations @ they have
committed.

33:30 Also, thou son of man, the @ of thy @ still are
talking @
 thee by the walls and in the doors of the @s, and
@K one to @F, @ one to his @X, @, Come, I pray
you, and hear what is the word that cometh @ from the LORD.

33:31 And they come unto thee as the @ cometh, and they sit
@	 thee as my @, and they hear thy @5, but they will not
do them: for with @ @P they shew much love, but @ @
goeth @ @ covetousness.

33:32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
hath a pleasant @;, and can play well on an instrument: for they
hear thy @5, but they do them not.

33:33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then @
they know that a prophet hath been @ them.

34:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 34:2 Son of man,
prophesy @
 the shepherds of @, prophesy, and say unto them,
Thus @
 the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of
@ that do feed @T! @# not the shepherds feed the
flocks?  34:3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill
them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

34:4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, @" have ye healed
that @ was sick, @" have ye bound up that @ was broken,
@" have ye @ @* that @ was driven away, @" have
ye sought that @ was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye
ruled them.

34:5 And they were scattered, @ @ is no shepherd: and they
became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.

34:6 My sheep wandered @E all the mountains, and upon @ high
hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the @, and
none did search or seek @ them.

34:7 @N, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8 As I
live, @
 the Lord GOD, surely @ my flock became a prey, and
my flock became meat to @ beast of the field, @ @ was no
shepherd, @" did my shepherds search for my flock, but the
shepherds fed @T, and fed not my flock; 34:9 @N, O ye
shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:10 Thus @
 the Lord GOD;
@., I am @
 the shepherds; and I will require my flock at
@ hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; @"
@ the shepherds feed @T any more; for I will deliver my
flock from @ @P, that they may not be meat for them.

34:11 For thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I, even I, will both search
my sheep, and seek them out.

34:12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is @
his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will
deliver them out of all @'s where they have been scattered in the
cloudy and dark day.

34:13 And I will @( them out from the @, and gather them from
the countries, and will @( them to @ own land, and feed them
upon the mountains of @ by the rivers, and in all the inhabited
@'s of the country.

34:14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
of @ @ @ fold be: @ @ they lie in a good fold,
and in a fat pasture @ they feed upon the mountains of @.

34:15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, @

the Lord GOD.

34:16 I will seek that @ was lost, and @( @* that @ was
driven away, and will bind up that @ was broken, and will
strengthen that @ was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the
strong; I will feed them with judgment.

34:17 And as for you, O my flock, thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I
judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.

34:18 Seemeth it a small @7 unto you to have eaten up the good
pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your
pastures? and to have drunk of the deep @Zs, but ye must foul the
residue with your feet?  34:19 And as for my flock, they eat that
@ ye have trodden with your feet; and they @b that @ ye
have fouled with your feet.

34:20 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD unto them; @., I, even I,
will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.

34:21 Because ye have thrust with side and with @#er, and pushed
all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
34:22 @N will I save my flock, and they @ no more be a
prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

34:23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he @ feed
them, even my @< @; he @ feed them, and he @ be @
shepherd.

34:24 And I the LORD will be @ God, and my @< @ a prince
@ them; I the LORD have spoken it.

34:25 And I will make with them a covenant of @U, and will cause
the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they @ dwell safely
in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

34:26 And I will make them and the @'s round @+ my hill a
blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;
@ @ be showers of blessing.

34:27 And the tree of the field @ yield her fruit, and the @
@ yield her increase, and they @ be safe in @ land, and
@ know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of @
yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of @J that served
@T of them.

34:28 And they @ no more be a prey to the heathen, @" @
the beast of the land devour them; but they @ dwell safely, and
none @ make them afraid.

34:29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they @
be no more consumed with hunger in the land, @" bear the shame of
the heathen any more.

34:30 Thus @ they know that I the LORD @ God am with them, and
that they, even the @ of @, are my @, @
 the Lord
GOD.

34:31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
God, @
 the Lord GOD.

35:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 35:2 Son of
man, set thy face @
 mount Seir, and prophesy @
 it, 35:3
And say unto it, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., O mount Seir, I am
@
 thee, and I will stretch out mine hand @
 thee, and I
will make thee most desolate.

35:4 I will lay thy @G waste, and thou @ be desolate, and thou
@ know that I am the LORD.

35:5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the @I
of the @ of @ by the force of the @Q in the time of
@ calamity, in the time that @ iniquity had an end: 35:6
@N, as I live, @
 the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto
@I, and @I @ pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated @I,
even @I @ pursue thee.

35:7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
him that passeth out and him that returneth.

35:8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,
and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, @ they fall that are
slain with the @Q.

35:9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy @G @ not
return: and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

35:10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and @ two
countries @ be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was
@: 35:11 @N, as I live, @
 the Lord GOD, I will even do
@$ to @ anger, and @$ to @ envy @ thou hast
used out of thy hatred @
 them; and I will make myself known
@ them, when I have judged thee.

35:12 And thou @ know that I am the LORD, and that I have @)
all thy blasphemies @ thou hast spoken @
 the mountains of
@, @, They are laid desolate, they are @= us to consume.

35:13 Thus with your @P ye have boasted @
 me, and have
multiplied your @5 @
 me: I have @) them.

35:14 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; When the whole @ rejoiceth, I will
make thee desolate.

35:15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the @ of @,
@ it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou @ be
desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they @
know that I am the LORD.

36:1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of @, and
say, Ye mountains of @, hear the word of the LORD: 36:2 Thus
@
 the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said @
 you, Aha, even
the ancient high @'s are ours in possession: 36:3 @N
prophesy and say, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because they have made you
desolate, and swallowed you up on @ side, that ye @B be a
possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the
lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the @: 36:4 @N, ye
mountains of @, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus @
 the
Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the
valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the @G that are forsaken,
@ became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that
are round @+; 36:5 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Surely in the
fire of my jealousy have I spoken @
 the residue of the heathen,
and @
 all Idumea, @ have appointed my land into @
possession with the joy of all @ @, with despiteful minds, to
cast it out for a prey.

36:6 Prophesy @fore concerning the land of @, and say unto
the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys,
Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I have spoken in my jealousy and in
my fury, @ ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 36:7
@N thus @
 the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely
the heathen that are @+ you, they @ bear @ shame.

36:8 But ye, O mountains of @, ye @ shoot @ your
branches, and yield your fruit to my @ of @; for they are at
hand to come.

36:9 For, @%, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye @
be tilled and sown: 36:10 And I will multiply men upon you, all the
@ of @, even all of it: and the @G @ be inhabited,
and the wastes @ be builded: 36:11 And I will multiply upon you
man and beast; and they @ increase and @( fruit: and I will
settle you @ your old estates, and will do better unto you than at
your beginnings: and ye @ know that I am the LORD.

36:12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my @ @;
and they @ possess thee, and thou @ be @ inheritance, and
thou @ no more hence@ bereave them of men.

36:13 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations: 36:14 @N thou
@ devour men no more, @" bereave thy nations any more, @

the Lord GOD.

36:15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more, @" @ thou bear the reproach of the @
any more, @" @ thou cause thy nations to fall any more, @

the Lord GOD.

36:16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 36:17 Son of
man, when the @ of @ dwelt in @ own land, they defiled it
by @ own way and by @ doings: @ way was @	 me as the
uncleanness of a removed woman.

36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the @I that they had
shed upon the land, and for @ idols wherewith they had polluted
it: 36:19 And I scattered them @ the heathen, and they were
dispersed @E the countries: @$ to @ way and @$
to @ doings I judged them.

36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the @ of
the LORD, and are gone @ out of his land.

36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, @ the @ of @ had
profaned @ the heathen, whither they went.

36:22 @N say unto the @ of @, thus @
 the Lord GOD;
I do not this for your sakes, O @ of @, but for mine holy
name's sake, @ ye have profaned @ the heathen, whither ye
went.

36:23 And I will sanctify my @ name, @ was profaned @ the
heathen, @ ye have profaned in the @a of them; and the heathen
@ know that I am the LORD, @
 the Lord GOD, when I @ be
sanctified in you @	 @ eyes.

36:24 For I will take you from @ the heathen, and gather you out
of all countries, and will @( you into your own land.

36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean @Z upon you, and ye @ be
clean: from all your fil@ss, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you.

36:26 A new @ also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
within you: and I will take away the stony @ out of your @R,
and I will give you an @ of @R.

36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye @ keep my judgments, and do them.

36:28 And ye @ dwell in the land that I gave to your @s; and
ye @ be my @, and I will be your God.

36:29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.

36:30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
the field, that ye @ receive no more reproach of famine @ the
heathen.

36:31 Then @ ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
were not good, and @ lothe yourselves in your own sight for your
iniquities and for your abominations.

36:32 Not for your sakes do I this, @
 the Lord GOD, be it known
unto you: be ashamed and con@Ved for your own ways, O @ of
@.

36:33 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; In the day that I @ have cleansed
you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the
@G, and the wastes @ be builded.

36:34 And the desolate land @ be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
in the sight of all that passed by.

36:35 And they @ say, This land that was desolate is become like
the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined @G are
become fenced, and are inhabited.

36:36 Then the heathen that are left round @+ you @ know that I
the LORD build the ruined @'s, and plant that that was desolate: I
the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

36:37 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
the @ of @, to do it for them; I will increase them with men
like a flock.

36:38 As the holy flock, as the flock of @  in her solemn
feasts; so @ the waste @G be filled with flocks of men: and
they @ know that I am the LORD.

37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the @a of the valley @
was full of bones, 37:2 And caused me to pass by them round @+:
and, @%, @ were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they
were very dry.

37:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can @ bones live? And I
@>, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

37:4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon @ bones, and say unto
them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

37:5 Thus @
 the Lord GOD unto @ bones; @., I will cause
breath to enter into you, and ye @ live: 37:6 And I will lay
sinews upon you, and will @( up @R upon you, and cover you with
skin, and put breath in you, and ye @ live; and ye @ know that
I am the LORD.

37:7 So I prophesied as I was @M: and as I prophesied, @
was a noise, and @% a shaking, and the bones came @?, bone
to his bone.

37:8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the @R came up upon
them, and the skin covered them above: but @ was no breath in
them.

37:9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
man, and say to the wind, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Come from the four
winds, O breath, and breathe upon @ slain, that they may live.

37:10 So I prophesied as he @M me, and the breath came into
them, and they lived, and stood up upon @ feet, an exceeding @
army.

37:11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, @ bones are the whole
@ of @: @%, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope
is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

37:12 @N prophesy and say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD;
@., O my @, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up
out of your graves, and @( you into the land of @.

37:13 And ye @ know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
graves, O my @, and @ you up out of your graves, 37:14 And
@ put my spirit in you, and ye @ live, and I @ @' you
in your own land: then @ ye know that I the LORD have spoken it,
and performed it, @
 the LORD.

37:15 The word of the LORD came @* unto me, @, 37:16 Moreover,
thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For @,
and for the @ of @ his companions: then take @F
stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all
the @ of @ his companions: 37:17 And join them one to @F
into one stick; and they @ become one in @ hand.

37:18 And when the @ of thy @ @ @K unto thee,
@, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by @?  37:19 Say
unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will take the stick of
Joseph, @ is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of @ his
fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of @, and
make them one stick, and they @ be one in mine hand.

37:20 And the sticks whereon thou writest @ be in @ hand
@	 @ eyes.

37:21 And say unto them, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; @., I will take
the @ of @ from @ the heathen, whither they be gone,
and will gather them on @ side, and @( them into @ own
land: 37:22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the
mountains of @; and one king @ be king to them all: and they
@ be no more two nations, @" @ they be divided into two
kingdoms any more at all.

37:23 Neither @ they defile @T any more with @ idols,
nor with @ detestable @, nor with any of @
transgressions: but I will save them out of all @ dwelling@'s,
wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so @ they be my
@, and I will be @ God.

37:24 And @ my @< @ be king over them; and they all @
have one shepherd: they @ also walk in my judgments, and observe
my statutes, and do them.

37:25 And they @ dwell in the land that I have @= unto @] my
@<, wherein your @s have dwelt; and they @ dwell
@in, even they, and @ @, and @ @'s @
for ever: and my @< @ @ be @ prince for ever.

37:26 Moreover I will make a covenant of @U with them; it @ be
an everlasting covenant with them: and I will @' them, and multiply
them, and will set my sanctuary in the @a of them for evermore.

37:27 My tabernacle also @ be with them: yea, I will be @ God,
and they @ be my @.

37:28 And the heathen @ know that I the LORD do sanctify @,
when my sanctuary @ be in the @a of them for evermore.

38:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 38:2 Son of man,
set thy face @
 Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of
Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy @
 him, 38:3 And say, Thus @

the Lord GOD; @., I am @
 thee, O Gog, the chief prince of
Meshech and Tubal: 38:4 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into
thy jaws, and I will @( thee @, and all @ army, horses and
horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a @
company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling @Qs: 38:5
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and
helmet: 38:6 Gomer, and all his bands; the @ of Togarmah of the
north quarters, and all his bands: and many @ with thee.

38:7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy

38:8 After many days thou @ be visited: in the latter @8 thou
@ come into the land that is @ back from the @Q, and is
ga@d out of many @, @
 the mountains of @, @
have been always waste: but it is @ @ out of the nations,
and they @ dwell safely all of them.

38:9 Thou @ ascend and come like a storm, thou @ be like a

thee.

38:10 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; It @ also come to pass, that at the

evil thought: 38:11 And thou @ say, I will go up to the land of

hand upon the desolate @'s that are now inhabited, and upon the
@ that are ga@d out of the nations, @ have gotten cattle

38:13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the

38:14 @N, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus @
 the
Lord GOD; In that day when my @ of @ dwelleth safely, @
thou not know it?  38:15 And thou @ come from thy @' out of the

be in the latter days, and I will @( thee @
 my land, that the
heathen may know me, when I @ be sanctified in thee, O Gog, @	
@ eyes.

38:17 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
old time by my @<s the prophets of @, @ prophesied in
@J days many @8 that I @L @( thee @
 them?  38:18 And
it @ come to pass at the same time when Gog @ come @
 the
land of @, @
 the Lord GOD, that my fury @ come up in my
face.

38:19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
Surely in that day @ @ be a @ shaking in the land of
@; 38:20 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the
@1, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping @ that
creep upon the @, and all the men that are upon the face of the
@, @ shake at my presence, and the mountains @ be thrown
down, and the steep @'s @ fall, and @ wall @ fall to

38:21 And I will call for a @Q @
 him @Eout all my

 the Lord GOD: @ man's @Q @ be @
 his

38:22 And I will plead @
 him with pestilence and with @I; and
I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many @
that are with him, an overflowing rain, and @ hailstones, fire,
and brimstone.

38:23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
known in the eyes of many nations, and they @ know that I am the
LORD.

39:1 @N, thou son of man, prophesy @
 Gog, and say, Thus
@
 the Lord GOD; @., I am @
 thee, O Gog, the chief prince
of Meshech and Tubal: 39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but
the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north
parts, and will @( thee upon the mountains of @: 39:3 And I
will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause @ arrows
to fall out of thy @c hand.

39:4 Thou @ fall upon the mountains of @, thou, and all thy
bands, and the @ that is with thee: I will give thee unto the
ravenous birds of @ sort, and to the beasts of the field to be
devoured.

39:5 Thou @ fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, @

the Lord GOD.

39:6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and @ them that dwell
carelessly in the isles: and they @ know that I am the LORD.

39:7 So will I make my holy name known in the @a of my @
@; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the
heathen @ know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in @.

39:8 @., it is come, and it is done, @
 the Lord GOD; this is
the day whereof I have spoken.

39:9 And they that dwell in the @G of @ @ go @, and
@ set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the
bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the @Dtaves, and the spears,
and they @ burn them with fire @H @8: 39:10 So that they
@ take no wood out of the field, @" cut down any out of the
forests; for they @ burn the weapons with fire: and they @
spoil @J that spoiled them, and rob @J that robbed them, @

the Lord GOD.

39:11 And it @ come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog
a @' @ of graves in @, the valley of the passengers on the
east of the sea: and it @ stop the noses of the passengers: and
@ @ they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they @ call
it The valley of H@og.

39:12 And @H months @ the @ of @ be burying of them,
that they may cleanse the land.

39:13 Yea, all the @ of the land @ bury them; and it @ be
to them a renown the day that I @ be glorified, @
 the Lord
GOD.

39:14 And they @ sever out men of continual employment, passing
@E the land to bury with the passengers @J that remain upon
the face of the @, to cleanse it: @ the end of @H months
@ they search.

39:15 And the passengers that pass @E the land, when any seeth a
man's bone, then @ he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have
buried it in the valley of H@og.

39:16 And also the name of the city @ be Hamonah. Thus @ they
cleanse the land.

39:17 And, thou son of man, thus @
 the Lord GOD; Speak unto @
fea@d fowl, and to @ beast of the field, Assemble yourselves,
and come; gather yourselves on @ side to my sacrifice that I do
sacrifice for you, even a @ sacrifice upon the mountains of
@, that ye may eat @R, and @b @I.

39:18 Ye @ eat the @R of the @By, and @b the @I of the
princes of the @, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks,
all of them fatlings of Bashan.

39:19 And ye @ eat fat till ye be full, and @b @I till ye be
drunken, of my sacrifice @ I have sacrificed for you.

39:20 Thus ye @ be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
with @By men, and with all men of war, @
 the Lord GOD.

39:21 And I will set my @Y @ the heathen, and all the heathen
@ see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have
laid upon them.

39:22 So the @ of @ @ know that I am the LORD @ God
from that day and forward.

39:23 And the heathen @ know that the @ of @ went into
captivity for @ iniquity: @ they trespassed @
 me,
@fore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of
@ enemies: so fell they all by the @Q.

39:24 According to @ uncleanness and @$ to @
transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.

39:25 @N thus @
 the Lord GOD; Now will I @( @* the
captivity of @], and have mercy upon the whole @ of @, and
will be jealous for my holy name; 39:26 After that they have borne
@ shame, and all @ trespasses whereby they have trespassed
@
 me, when they dwelt safely in @ land, and none made them
afraid.

39:27 When I have @ them @* from the @, and ga@d
them out of @ enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the
sight of many nations; 39:28 Then @ they know that I am the LORD
@ God, @ caused them to be led into captivity @ the
heathen: but I have ga@d them unto @ own land, and have left
none of them any more @.

39:29 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
poured out my spirit upon the @ of @, @
 the Lord GOD.

40:1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year
@ that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the
LORD was upon me, and @ me thither.

40:2 In the visions of God @ he me into the land of @, and
set me upon a very high mountain, by @ was as the frame of a city
on the south.

40:3 And he @ me thither, and, @%, @ was a man, whose
appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in
his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

40:4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, @% with @ eyes, and
hear with @ ears, and set @ @ upon all that I @ shew
thee; for to the intent that I @B shew them unto thee art thou
@ hither: declare all that thou seest to the @ of @.

40:5 And @% a wall on the outside of the @ round @+, and in
the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an
hand @dth: so he measured the @dth of the building, one reed;
and the height, one reed.

40:6 Then came he unto the gate @ looketh toward the east, and
went up the stairs @of, and measured the threshold of the gate,
@ was one reed broad; and the @C threshold of the gate, @
was one reed broad.

40:7 And @ little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;
and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of
the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.

40:8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

40:9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
posts @of, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.

40:10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were @@ on this
side, and @@ on that side; they @@ were of one measure: and the
posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

40:11 And he measured the @dth of the entry of the gate, ten
cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

40:12 The space also @	 the little chambers was one cubit on this
side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little
chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

40:13 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to
the roof of @F: the @dth was five and twenty cubits, door
@
 door.

40:14 He made also posts of @@score cubits, even unto the post of
the court round @+ the gate.

40:15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

40:16 And @ were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
@ posts within the gate round @+, and likewise to the arches:
and windows were round @+ inward: and upon each post were palm
trees.

40:17 Then @ he me into the outward court, and, lo, @ were
chambers, and a pavement made for the court round @+: thirty
chambers were upon the pavement.

40:18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over @
 the
length of the gates was the lower pavement.

40:19 Then he measured the @dth from the forefront of the lower
gate unto the forefront of the inner court @S, an @/ cubits
eastward and northward.

40:20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north,
he measured the length @of, and the @dth @of.

40:21 And the little chambers @of were @@ on this side and
@@ on that side; and the posts @of and the arches @of were
@ the measure of the @O gate: the length @of was fifty

40:22 And @ windows, and @ arches, and @ palm trees, were
@ the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they
went up unto it by @H steps; and the arches @of were @

40:23 And the gate of the inner court was over @
 the gate toward
the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an
@/ cubits.

40:24 After that he @ me toward the south, and @% a gate
toward the south: and he measured the posts @of and the arches
@of @$ to @ measures.

40:25 And @ were windows in it and in the arches @of round
@+, like @J windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the
@dth five and twenty cubits.

40:26 And @ were @H steps to go up to it, and the arches
@of were @	 them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and
@F on that side, upon the posts @of.

40:27 And @ was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
measured from gate to gate toward the south an @/ cubits.

40:28 And he @ me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
measured the south gate @$ to @ measures; 40:29 And the
little chambers @of, and the posts @of, and the arches
@of, @$ to @ measures: and @ were windows in it and
in the arches @of round @+: it was fifty cubits long, and five

40:30 And the arches round @+ were five and twenty cubits long, and
five cubits broad.

40:31 And the arches @of were toward the utter court; and palm
trees were upon the posts @of: and the going up to it had eight
steps.

40:32 And he @ me into the inner court toward the east: and he
measured the gate @$ to @ measures.

40:33 And the little chambers @of, and the posts @of, and the
arches @of, were @$ to @ measures: and @ were
windows @in and in the arches @of round @+: it was fifty

40:34 And the arches @of were toward the outward court; and palm
trees were upon the posts @of, on this side, and on that side: and
the going up to it had eight steps.

40:35 And he @ me to the north gate, and measured it @$
to @ measures; 40:36 The little chambers @of, the posts
@of, and the arches @of, and the windows to it round @+:
the length was fifty cubits, and the @dth five and twenty cubits.

40:37 And the posts @of were toward the utter court; and palm
trees were upon the posts @of, on this side, and on that side: and
the going up to it had eight steps.

40:38 And the chambers and the entries @of were by the posts of
the gates, where they washed the @_ @&.

40:39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
two tables on that side, to slay @on the @_ @& and the
sin @& and the trespass @&.

40:40 And at the side @S, as one goeth up to the entry of the
north gate, were two tables; and on the @C side, @ was at the
porch of the gate, were two tables.

40:41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by
the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew @
sacrifices.

40:42 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the @_ @&,
of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one
cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they
slew the @_ @& and the sacrifice.

40:43 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round @+: and
upon the tables was the @R of the @&.

40:44 And @S the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
the inner court, @ was at the side of the north gate; and @
prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having
the prospect toward the north.

40:45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
south, is for the @6s, the keepers of the charge of the @.

40:46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
@6s, the keepers of the charge of the @\: @ are the sons of
Zadok @ the sons of Levi, @ come near to the LORD to minister
unto him.

40:47 So he measured the court, an @/ cubits long, and an @/
cubits broad, foursquare; and the @\ that was @	 the @.

40:48 And he @ me to the porch of the @, and measured each
post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that
side: and the @dth of the gate was @@ cubits on this side, and
@@ cubits on that side.

40:49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the @dth
eleven cubits, and he @ me by the steps whereby they went up to
it: and @ were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and @F
on that side.

41:1 Afterward he @ me to the temple, and measured the posts,
six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the @C
side, @ was the @dth of the tabernacle.

41:2 And the @dth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the
door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the @C
side: and he measured the length @of, forty cubits: and the
@dth, twenty cubits.

41:3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the @dth of the door, @H
cubits.

41:4 So he measured the length @of, twenty cubits; and the
@dth, twenty cubits, @	 the temple: and he said unto me, This
is the most holy @'.

41:5 After he measured the wall of the @, six cubits; and the
@dth of @ side chamber, four cubits, round @+ the @ on
@ side.

41:6 And the side chambers were @@, one over @F, and thirty in
order; and they entered into the wall @ was of the @ for the
side chambers round @+, that they @B have hold, but they had not
hold in the wall of the @.

41:7 And @ was an enlarging, and a winding @+ still upward to
the side chambers: for the winding @+ of the @ went still
upward round @+ the @: @fore the @dth of the @ was
still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest
by the @a.

41:8 I saw also the height of the @ round @+: the @Vations
of the side chambers were a full reed of six @ cubits.

41:9 The thickness of the wall, @ was for the side chamber
@S, was five cubits: and that @ was left was the @' of the
side chambers that were within.

41:10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
@+ the @ on @ side.

41:11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the @' that
was left, one door toward the north, and @F door toward the
south: and the @dth of the @' that was left was five cubits
round @+.

41:12 Now the building that was @	 the separate @' at the end
toward the west was @Hty cubits broad; and the wall of the building
was five cubits thick round @+, and the length @of ninety
cubits.

41:13 So he measured the @, an @/ cubits long; and the
separate @', and the building, with the walls @of, an @/
cubits long; 41:14 Also the @dth of the face of the @, and of
the separate @' toward the east, an @/ cubits.

41:15 And he measured the length of the building over @
 the
separate @' @ was behind it, and the galleries @of on the
one side and on the @C side, an @/ cubits, with the inner
temple, and the porches of the court; 41:16 The door posts, and the
narrow windows, and the galleries round @+ on @ @@ stories,
over @
 the door, cieled with wood round @+, and from the
ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; 41:17 To that
above the door, even unto the inner @, and @S, and by all the
wall round @+ within and @S, by measure.

41:18 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and @ cherub had two
faces; 41:19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the
one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
@C side: it was made @E all the @ round @+.

41:20 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

41:21 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the @C.

41:22 The @\ of wood was @@ cubits high, and the length @of
two cubits; and the corners @of, and the length @of, and the
walls @of, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table
that is @	 the LORD.

41:23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

41:24 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the @C door.

41:25 And @ were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and @
were thick planks upon the face of the porch @S.

41:26 And @ were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and
on the @C side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side
chambers of the @, and thick planks.

42:1 Then he @ me @ into the utter court, the way toward the
north: and he @ me into the chamber that was over @
 the
separate @', and @ was @	 the building toward the north.

42:2 Before the length of an @/ cubits was the north door, and
the @dth was fifty cubits.

42:3 Over @
 the twenty cubits @ were for the inner court,
and over @
 the pavement @ was for the utter court, was
gallery @
 gallery in @@ stories.

42:4 And @	 the chambers was a walk to ten cubits @dth inward,
a way of one cubit; and @ doors toward the north.

42:5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
higher than @, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
building.

42:6 For they were in @@ stories, but had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts: @fore the building was straitened more than
the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

42:7 And the wall that was @S over @
 the chambers, toward
the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length @of
was fifty cubits.

42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
fifty cubits: and, lo, @	 the temple were an @/ cubits.

42:9 And from @[ @ chambers was the entry on the east side, as
one goeth into them from the utter court.

42:10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
toward the east, over @
 the separate @', and over @
 the
building.

42:11 And the way @	 them was like the appearance of the chambers
@ were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they:
and all @ goings out were both @$ to @ fashions, and
@$ to @ doors.

42:12 And @$ to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly @	
the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.

42:13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
@ are @	 the separate @', they be holy chambers, where the
@6s that approach unto the LORD @ eat the most holy @:
@ @ they lay the most holy @, and the meat @&, and
the sin @&, and the trespass @&; for the @' is holy.

42:14 When the @6s enter @in, then @ they not go out of
the holy @' into the utter court, but @ they @ lay @
garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and @ put on
@C garments, and @ approach to @J @ @ are for the

42:15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner @, he
@ me @ toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east,
and measured it round @+.

42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five @/
reeds, with the measuring reed round @+.

42:17 He measured the north side, five @/ reeds, with the
measuring reed round @+.

42:18 He measured the south side, five @/ reeds, with the
measuring reed.

42:19 He turned @+ to the west side, and measured five @/
reeds with the measuring reed.

42:20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round @+,
five @/ reeds long, and five @/ broad, to make a separation
between the sanctuary and the profane @'.

43:1 Afterward he @ me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
toward the east: 43:2 And, @%, the @Y of the God of @ came
from the way of the east: and his @; was like a noise of many
@Zs: and the @ shined with his @Y.

43:3 And it was @$ to the appearance of the vision @ I saw,
even @$ to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the
city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river
Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

43:4 And the @Y of the LORD came into the @ by the way of the
gate whose prospect is toward the east.

43:5 So the spirit took me up, and @ me into the inner court;
and, @%, the @Y of the LORD filled the @.

43:6 And I @) him @King unto me out of the @; and the man
stood by me.

43:7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the @' of my throne, and the
@' of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the @a of the
@ of @ for ever, and my holy name, @ the @ of
@ no more defile, @" they, nor @ kings, by @
whoredom, nor by the carcases of @ kings in @ high @'s.

43:8 In @ setting of @ threshold by my thresholds, and @
post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even
defiled my holy name by @ abominations that they have committed:
wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

43:9 Now let them put away @ whoredom, and the carcases of @
kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the @a of them for ever.

43:10 Thou son of man, shew the @ to the @ of @, that
they may be ashamed of @ iniquities: and let them measure the
pattern.

43:11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
form of the @, and the fashion @of, and the goings out
@of, and the comings in @of, and all the forms @of, and
all the ordinances @of, and all the forms @of, and all the
laws @of: and write it in @ sight, that they may keep the
whole form @of, and all the ordinances @of, and do them.

43:12 This is the law of the @; Upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit @of round @+ @ be most holy. @., this is
the law of the @.

43:13 And @ are the measures of the @\ @ the cubits: The
cubit is a cubit and an hand @dth; even the bottom @ be a
cubit, and the @dth a cubit, and the border @of by the edge
@of round @+ @ be a span: and this @ be the higher
@' of the @\.

43:14 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
@ be two cubits, and the @dth one cubit; and from the lesser
settle even to the @er settle @ be four cubits, and the
@dth one cubit.

43:15 So the @\ @ be four cubits; and from the @\ and upward
@ be four horns.

43:16 And the @\ @ be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
in the four squares @of.

43:17 And the settle @ be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
in the four squares @of; and the border @+ it @ be half a
cubit; and the bottom @of @ be a cubit @+; and his stairs
@ look toward the east.

43:18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus @
 the Lord GOD; These
are the ordinances of the @\ in the day when they @ make it, to
offer @_ @&s @on, and to sprinkle @I @on.

43:19 And thou @ give to the @6s the Levites that be of the
seed of Zadok, @ approach unto me, to minister unto me, @
 the
Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin @&.

43:20 And thou @ take of the @I @of, and put it on the four
horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the
border round @+: thus @ thou cleanse and purge it.

43:21 Thou @ take the bullock also of the sin @&, and he
@ burn it in the appointed @' of the @, @S the
sanctuary.

43:22 And on the second day thou @ offer a kid of the goats
@S blemish for a sin @&; and they @ cleanse the @\,
as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

43:23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou @ offer a
young bullock @S blemish, and a ram out of the flock @S
blemish.

43:24 And thou @ offer them @	 the LORD, and the @6s @
cast salt upon them, and they @ offer them up for a @_ @&
unto the LORD.

43:25 Seven days @ thou prepare @ day a goat for a sin
@&: they @ also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of
the flock, @S blemish.

43:26 Seven days @ they purge the @\ and purify it; and they
@ consecrate @T.

43:27 And when @ days are expired, it @ be, that upon the
eighth day, and so forward, the @6s @ make your @_
@&s upon the @\, and your @U @&s; and I will accept
you, @
 the Lord GOD.

44:1 Then he @ me back the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary @ looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

44:2 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate @ be shut, it @ not
be opened, and no man @ enter in by it; @ the LORD, the God
of @, hath entered in by it, @fore it @ be shut.

44:3 It is for the prince; the prince, he @ sit in it to eat @d
@	 the LORD; he @ enter by the way of the porch of that gate,
and @ go out by the way of the same.

44:4 Then @ he me the way of the north gate @	 the @:
and I looked, and, @%, the @Y of the LORD filled the @ of
the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

44:5 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and @% with
@ eyes, and hear with @ ears all that I say unto thee
concerning all the ordinances of the @ of the LORD, and all the
laws @of; and mark well the entering in of the @, with @
going @ of the sanctuary.

44:6 And thou @ say to the rebellious, even to the @ of
@, Thus @
 the Lord GOD; O ye @ of @, let it suffice
you of all your abominations, 44:7 In that ye have @ into my
sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in @, and uncircumcised in
@R, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my @, when ye
offer my @d, the fat and the @I, and they have broken my
covenant @ of all your abominations.

44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy @: but ye have
set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

44:9 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in @, nor
uncircumcised in @R, @ enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger
that is @ the @ of @.

44:10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when @ went
astray, @ went astray away from me @ @ idols; they @
even bear @ iniquity.

44:11 Yet they @ be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
the gates of the @, and ministering to the @: they @ slay
the @_ @& and the sacrifice for the @, and they @
stand @	 them to minister unto them.

44:12 Because they ministered unto them @	 @ idols, and caused
the @ of @ to fall into iniquity; @fore have I lifted up
mine hand @
 them, @
 the Lord GOD, and they @ bear @
iniquity.

44:13 And they @ not come near unto me, to do the office of a
@6 unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy @, in the most
holy @': but they @ bear @ shame, and @ abominations
@ they have committed.

44:14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the @, for all
the service @of, and for all that @ be done @in.

44:15 But the @6s the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the @ of @ went astray from
me, they @ come near to me to minister unto me, and they @
stand @	 me to offer unto me the fat and the @I, @
 the Lord
GOD: 44:16 They @ enter into my sanctuary, and they @ come
near to my table, to minister unto me, and they @ keep my charge.

44:17 And it @ come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
of the inner court, they @ be clothed with linen garments; and no
wool @ come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the
inner court, and within.

44:18 They @ have linen bonnets upon @ heads, and @ have
linen breeches upon @ loins; they @ not gird @T with
any @7 that causeth sweat.

44:19 And when they go @ into the utter court, even into the utter
court to the @, they @ put off @ garments wherein they
ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they @ put on
@C garments; and they @ not sanctify the @ with @
garments.

44:20 Neither @ they shave @ heads, nor suffer @ locks to
grow long; they @ only poll @ heads.

44:21 Neither @ any @6 @b wine, when they enter into the
inner court.

44:22 Neither @ they take for @ wives a widow, nor her that is
put away: but they @ take maidens of the seed of the @ of
@, or a widow that had a @6 @	.

44:23 And they @ teach my @ the difference between the holy
and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the
clean.

44:24 And in controversy they @ stand in judgment; and they @
judge it @$ to my judgments: and they @ keep my laws and my
statutes in all mine assemblies; and they @ hallow my sabbaths.

44:25 And they @ come at no dead person to defile @T: but
for @, or for m@C, or for son, or for daughter, for @X,
or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile @T.

44:26 And @ he is cleansed, they @ reckon unto him @H days.

44:27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner
court, to minister in the sanctuary, he @ offer his sin @&,
@
 the Lord GOD.

44:28 And it @ be unto them for an inheritance: I am @
inheritance: and ye @ give them no possession in @: I am
@ possession.

44:29 They @ eat the meat @&, and the sin @&, and the
trespass @&: and @ dedicated @7 in @ @ be
@s.

44:30 And the @O of all the @Ofruits of all @, and @
oblation of all, of @ sort of your oblations, @ be the
@6's: ye @ also give unto the @6 the @O of your dough,
that he may cause the blessing to rest in @ @.

44:31 The @6s @ not eat of any @7 that is dead of itself,
or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

45:1 Moreover, when ye @ divide by lot the land for inheritance,
ye @ offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land:
the length @ be the length of five and twenty @: reeds, and
the @dth @ be ten @:. This @ be holy in all the
borders @of round @+.

45:2 Of this @ @ be for the sanctuary five @/ in length,
with five @/ in @dth, square round @+; and fifty cubits
round @+ for the suburbs @of.

45:3 And of this measure @ thou measure the length of five and
twenty @:, and the @dth of ten @:: and in it @ be
the sanctuary and the most holy @'.

45:4 The holy portion of the land @ be for the @6s the
ministers of the sanctuary, @ @ come near to minister unto the
LORD: and it @ be a @' for @ @s, and an holy @' for
the sanctuary.

45:5 And the five and twenty @: of length, and the ten @:
of @dth @ also the Levites, the ministers of the @, have
for @T, for a possession for twenty chambers.

45:6 And ye @ appoint the possession of the city five @:
broad, and five and twenty @: long, over @
 the oblation of
the holy portion: it @ be for the whole @ of @.

45:7 And a portion @ be for the prince on the one side and on the
@C side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession
of the city, @	 the oblation of the holy portion, and @	 the
possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east
side eastward: and the length @ be over @
 one of the
portions, from the west border unto the east border.

45:8 In the land @ be his possession in @: and my princes
@ no more oppress my @; and the rest of the land @ they
give to the @ of @ @$ to @ tribes.

45:9 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of @:
remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away
your exactions from my @, @
 the Lord GOD.

45:10 Ye @ have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

45:11 The ephah and the bath @ be of one measure, that the bath
may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part
of an homer: the measure @of @ be @ the homer.

45:12 And the shekel @ be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and
twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, @ be your maneh.

45:13 This is the oblation that ye @ offer; the sixth part of an
ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye @ give the sixth part of an
ephah of an homer of barley: 45:14 Concerning the ordinance of oil,
the bath of oil, ye @ offer the tenth part of a bath out of the
cor, @ is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: 45:15
And one lamb out of the flock, out of two @/, out of the fat
pastures of @; for a meat @&, and for a @_ @&, and
for @U @&s, to make reconciliation for them, @
 the Lord
GOD.

45:16 All the @ of the land @ give this oblation for the
prince in @.

45:17 And it @ be the prince's part to give @_ @&s, and
meat @&s, and @b @&s, in the feasts, and in the new
moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the @ of @:
he @ prepare the sin @&, and the meat @&, and the
@_ @&, and the @U @&s, to make reconciliation for
the @ of @.

45:18 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; In the @O month, in the @O day of
the month, thou @ take a young bullock @S blemish, and
cleanse the sanctuary: 45:19 And the @6 @ take of the @I of
the sin @&, and put it upon the posts of the @, and upon the
four corners of the settle of the @\, and upon the posts of the
gate of the inner court.

45:20 And so thou @ do the @Hth day of the month for @ one
that erreth, and for him that is simple: so @ ye reconcile the
@.

45:21 In the @O month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye @
have the passover, a feast of @H days; unleavened @d @ be
eaten.

45:22 And upon that day @ the prince prepare for @9 and for
all the @ of the land a bullock for a sin @&.

45:23 And @H days of the feast he @ prepare a @_ @& to
the LORD, @H bullocks and @H rams @S blemish daily the
@H days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin @&.

45:24 And he @ prepare a meat @& of an ephah for a bullock,
and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.

45:25 In the @Hth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, @
he do the like in the feast of the @H days, @$ to the sin
@&, @$ to the @_ @&, and @$ to the meat
@&, and @$ to the oil.

46:1 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh
toward the east @ be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath
it @ be opened, and in the day of the new moon it @ be opened.

46:2 And the prince @ enter by the way of the porch of that gate
@S, and @ stand by the post of the gate, and the @6s
@ prepare his @_ @& and his @U @&s, and he @
worship at the threshold of the gate: then he @ go @; but the
gate @ not be shut until the evening.

46:3 Likewise the @ of the land @ worship at the door of this
gate @	 the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.

46:4 And the @_ @& that the prince @ offer unto the LORD
in the sabbath day @ be six lambs @S blemish, and a ram
@S blemish.

46:5 And the meat @& @ be an ephah for a ram, and the meat
@& for the lambs as he @ be able to give, and an hin of oil
to an ephah.

46:6 And in the day of the new moon it @ be a young bullock
@S blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they @ be @S
blemish.

46:7 And he @ prepare a meat @&, an ephah for a bullock, and
an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs @$ as his hand @
attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

46:8 And when the prince @ enter, he @ go in by the way of the
porch of that gate, and he @ go @ by the way @of.

46:9 But when the @ of the land @ come @	 the LORD in the
solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to
worship @ go out by the way of the south gate; and he that
entereth by the way of the south gate @ go @ by the way of the
north gate: he @ not return by the way of the gate whereby he came
in, but @ go @ over @
 it.

46:10 And the prince in the @a of them, when they go in, @ go
in; and when they go @, @ go @.

46:11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat @& @
be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as
he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

46:12 Now when the prince @ prepare a voluntary @_ @& or
@U @&s voluntarily unto the LORD, one @ then open him the
gate that looketh toward the east, and he @ prepare his @_
@& and his @U @&s, as he did on the sabbath day: then
he @ go @; and @ his going @ one @ shut the gate.

46:13 Thou @ daily prepare a @_ @& unto the LORD of a
lamb of the @O year @S blemish: thou @ prepare it @
morning.

46:14 And thou @ prepare a meat @& for it @ morning, the
sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper
with the fine flour; a meat @& continually by a perpetual
ordinance unto the LORD.

46:15 Thus @ they prepare the lamb, and the meat @&, and the
oil, @ morning for a continual @_ @&.

46:16 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
his sons, the inheritance @of @ be his sons'; it @ be
@ possession by inheritance.

46:17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his @<s,
then it @ be his to the year of liberty; @ it @ return to
the prince: but his inheritance @ be his sons' for them.

46:18 Moreover the prince @ not take of the @'s inheritance
by oppression, to thrust them out of @ possession; but he @
give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my @ be
not scattered @ man from his possession.

46:19 After he @ me @E the entry, @ was at the side of
the gate, into the holy chambers of the @6s, @ looked toward
the north: and, @%, @ was a @' on the two sides westward.

46:20 Then said he unto me, This is the @' where the @6s @
boil the trespass @& and the sin @&, where they @ bake
the meat @&; that they bear them not out into the utter court,
to sanctify the @.

46:21 Then he @ me @ into the utter court, and caused me to
pass by the four corners of the court; and, @%, in @ corner of
the court @ was a court.

46:22 In the four corners of the court @ were courts joined of
forty cubits long and thirty broad: @ four corners were of one
measure.

46:23 And @ was a row of building round @+ in them, round @+
them four, and it was made with boiling @'s @[ the rows round
@+.

46:24 Then said he unto me, These are the @'s of them that boil,
where the ministers of the @ @ boil the sacrifice of the
@.

47:1 Afterward he @ me @* unto the door of the @; and,
@%, @Zs issued out from @[ the threshold of the @
eastward: for the forefront of the @ stood toward the east, and
the @Zs came down from @[ from the @c side of the @, at
the south side of the @\.

47:2 Then @ he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led
me @+ the way @S unto the utter gate by the way that looketh
eastward; and, @%, @ ran out @Zs on the @c side.

47:3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went @
eastward, he measured a @: cubits, and he @ me @E the
@Zs; the @Zs were to the ankles.

47:4 Again he measured a @:, and @ me @E the @Zs;
the @Zs were to the knees. Again he measured a @:, and
@ me @E; the @Zs were to the loins.

47:5 Afterward he measured a @:; and it was a river that I could
not pass over: for the @Zs were risen, @Zs to swim in, a river
that could not be passed over.

47:6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
@ me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

47:7 Now when I had returned, @%, at the bank of the river were
very many trees on the one side and on the @C.

47:8 Then said he unto me, These @Zs issue out toward the east
country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: @ being
@ @ into the sea, the @Zs @ be healed.

47:9 And it @ come to pass, that @ @7 that liveth, @
moveth, whithersoever the rivers @ come, @ live: and @
@ be a very @ multitude of fish, @ @ @Zs @
come thither: for they @ be healed; and @ @7 @ live
whither the river cometh.

47:10 And it @ come to pass, that the fishers @ stand upon it
from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they @ be a @' to spread @
nets; @ fish @ be @$ to @ kinds, as the fish of the
@ sea, exceeding many.

47:11 But the miry @'s @of and the marishes @of @ not
be healed; they @ be @= to salt.

47:12 And by the river upon the bank @of, on this side and on that
side, @ grow all trees for meat, whose leaf @ not fade,
@" @ the fruit @of be consumed: it @ @( @ new
fruit @$ to his months, @ @ @Zs they issued out of
the sanctuary: and the fruit @of @ be for meat, and the leaf
@of for medicine.

47:13 Thus @
 the Lord GOD; This @ be the border, whereby ye
@ inherit the land @$ to the twelve tribes of @:
Joseph @ have two portions.

47:14 And ye @ inherit it, one as well as @F: concerning the
@ I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your @s: and this
land @ fall unto you for inheritance.

47:15 And this @ be the border of the land toward the north side,
from the @ sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 47:16
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, @ is between the border of Damascus and
the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, @ is by the coast of Hauran.

47:17 And the border from the sea @ be Hazarenan, the border of
Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this
is the north side.

47:18 And the east side ye @ measure from Hauran, and from
Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of @ by Jordan, from
the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.

47:19 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the @Zs of
strife in Kadesh, the river to the @ sea. And this is the south
side southward.

47:20 The west side also @ be the @ sea from the border, till
a man come over @
 Hamath. This is the west side.

47:21 So @ ye divide this land unto you @$ to the tribes of
@.

47:22 And it @ come to pass, that ye @ divide it by lot for an
inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn @ you,
@ @ beget @ @ you: and they @ be unto you as

The Book of Daniel


1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of @ came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto @ , and besieged it.

1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of @ into his hand, with part
of the vessels of the @ of God: @ he carried into the land of
Shinar to the @ of his god; and he @ the vessels into the
treasure @ of his god.

1:3 And the king @0 unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that
he @# @( certain of the @ of @, and of the king's
seed, and of the princes; 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but
well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge,
and @[standing science, and such as had ability in them to stand in
the king's palace, and whom they @B teach the learning and the
tongue of the Chaldeans.

1:5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat,
and of the wine @ he drank: so nourishing them @@ @8, that
at the end @of they @B stand @	 the king.

1:6 Now @ @ were of the @ of @, Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah: 1:7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave
names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to
Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
Abednego.

1:8 But Daniel purposed in his @ that he @L not defile @9
with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine @ he drank:
@fore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he @B not
defile @9.

1:9 Now God had @ Daniel into favour and tender love with the
prince of the eunuchs.

1:10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
the king, who hath appointed your meat and your @b: for why @#
he see your faces worse liking than the @ @ are of your
sort? then @ ye make me endanger my head to the king.

1:11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 1:12 Prove thy
@<s, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat,
and @Z to @b.

1:13 Then let our countenances be looked upon @	 thee, and the
countenance of the @ that eat of the portion of the king's
meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy @<s.

1:14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.

1:15 And at the end of ten days @ countenances appeared fairer and
fatter in @R than all the @ @ did eat the portion of the
king's meat.

1:16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of @ meat, and the wine
that they @# @b; and gave them pulse.

1:17 As for @ four @, God gave them knowledge and skill in
all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had @[standing in all visions
and dreams.

1:18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he @# @(
them in, then the prince of the eunuchs @ them in @	
Nebuchadnezzar.

1:19 And the king communed with them; and @ them all was @V
none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: @fore stood they
@	 the king.

1:20 And in all matters of wisdom and @[standing, that the king
enquired of them, he @V them ten times better than all the
magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

1:21 And Daniel continued even unto the @O year of king Cyrus.

2:1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and
his sleep brake from him.

2:2 Then the king @M to call the magicians, and the
astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the
king his dreams. So they came and stood @	 the king.

2:3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
was troubled to know the dream.

2:4 Then @0 the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for
ever: tell thy @<s the dream, and we will shew the
interpretation.

2:5 The king @> and said to the Chaldeans, The @7 is gone
from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
interpretation @of, ye @ be cut in pieces, and your @s
@ be made a dunghill.

2:6 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation @of, ye @
receive of me gifts and rewards and @ honour: @fore shew me
the dream, and the interpretation @of.

2:7 They @> @* and said, Let the king tell his @<s the
dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

2:8 The king @> and said, I know of certainty that ye @L gain
the time, @ ye see the @7 is gone from me.

2:9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, @ is but one
decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt @5 to @K
@	 me, till the time be changed: @fore tell me the dream, and
I @ know that ye can shew me the interpretation @of.

2:10 The Chaldeans @> @	 the king, and said, There is not a
man upon the @ that can shew the king's matter: @fore @ is
no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such @ at any magician, or
astrologer, or Chaldean.

2:11 And it is a rare @7 that the king requireth, and @ is none
@C that can shew it @	 the king, except the gods, whose
dwelling is not with @R.

2:12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and @M
to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

2:13 And the decree went @ that the wise men @# be slain; and
they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

2:14 Then Daniel @> with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the king's guard, @ was gone @ to slay the wise men
of Babylon: 2:15 He @> and said to Arioch the king's captain,
Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the @7
known to Daniel.

2:16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he @L give
him time, and that he @L shew the king the interpretation.

2:17 Then Daniel went to his @, and made the @7 known to
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 2:18 That they @L
desire mercies of the God of @1 concerning this secret; that
Daniel and his fellows @# not perish with the rest of the wise men
of Babylon.

2:19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then
Daniel blessed the God of @1.

2:20 Daniel @> and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and
ever: for wisdom and @B are his: 2:21 And he changeth the times and
the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom
unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know @[standing: 2:22 He
revealeth the deep and secret @: he knoweth what is in the
darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

2:23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my @s, who hast
@= me wisdom and @B, and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's
matter.

2:24 @N Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him;
Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: @( me in @	 the king, and
I will shew unto the king the interpretation.

2:25 Then Arioch @ in Daniel @	 the king in haste, and said
thus unto him, I have @V a man of the captives of @, that will
make known unto the king the interpretation.

2:26 The king @> and said to Daniel, whose name was
Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream @ I
have seen, and the interpretation @of?  2:27 Daniel @> in
the presence of the king, and said, The secret @ the king hath
demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the
soothsayers, shew unto the king; 2:28 But @ is a God in @1
that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar
what @ be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy
head upon thy bed, are @; 2:29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts
came into thy mind upon thy bed, what @# come to pass here@:
and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what @ come to
pass.

2:30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
that I have more than any living, but for @ sakes that @ make
known the interpretation to the king, and that thou @Best know the
thoughts of thy @.

2:31 Thou, O king, sawest, and @% a @ image. This @ image,
whose b@cness was excellent, stood @	 thee; and the form
@of was terrible.

2:32 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 2:33 His legs of iron, his
feet part of iron and part of clay.

2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out @S @D, @
smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
them to pieces.

2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
broken to pieces @?, and became like the chaff of the summer
threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no @' was
@V for them: and the stone that smote the image became a @
mountain, and filled the whole @.

2:36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation @of
@	 the king.

2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of @1 hath
@= thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and @Y.

2:38 And wheresoever the @ of men dwell, the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the @1 hath he @= into @ hand, and
hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.

2:39 And @ thee @ arise @F kingdom inferior to thee, and
@F third kingdom of brass, @ @ bear rule over all the
@.

2:40 And the fourth kingdom @ be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all @: and as iron that breaketh
all @, @ it break in pieces and bruise.

2:41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay,
and part of iron, the kingdom @ be divided; but @ @ be in
it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
mixed with miry clay.

2:42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
so the kingdom @ be partly strong, and partly broken.

2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they @
mingle @T with the seed of men: but they @ not cleave one
to @F, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

2:44 And in the days of @ kings @ the God of @1 set up a
kingdom, @ @ never be destroyed: and the kingdom @ not be
left to @C @, but it @ break in pieces and consume all
@ kingdoms, and it @ stand for ever.

2:45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain @S @D, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the
brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the @ God hath made
known to the king what @ come to pass here@: and the dream is
certain, and the interpretation @of sure.

2:46 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
Daniel, and @M that they @# offer an oblation and sweet
odours unto him.

2:47 The king @> unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that
your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of
secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

2:48 Then the king made Daniel a @ man, and gave him many @
gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and
chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

2:49 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel
sat in the gate of the king.

3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was
@@score cubits, and the @dth @of six cubits: he set it up in
the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather @? the princes,
the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the
counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to
come to the dedication of the image @ Nebuchadnezzar the king had
set up.

3:3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the
provinces, were ga@d @? unto the dedication of the image
that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood @	 the
image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

3:4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is @M, O @,
nations, and languages, 3:5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of
musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar

3:7 @N at that time, when all the @ @) the sound of the

3:8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused
the Jews.

3:9 They @0 and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for

3:10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that @ man that @ hear

3:12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; @ men, O

3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury @M to @(

3:14 Nebuchadnezzar @0 and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden

ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and
dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image
@ I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye @ be cast the

God that @ deliver you out of my @D?  3:16 Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, @> and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are
not careful to answer thee in this matter.

3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of @ hand, O
king.

3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
thy gods, nor worship the golden image @ thou hast set up.

3:19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage
was changed @
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: @fore he
@0, and @M that they @# heat the furnace one @H times
more than it was wont to be heated.

3:20 And he @M the most @By men that were in his army to

3:21 Then @ men were bound in @ coats, @ hosen, and @

3:22 @N @ the king's commandment was urgent, and the

3:23 And @ @@ men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down

3:24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,

bound into the @a of the fire? They @> and said unto the
king, True, O king.

3:25 He @> and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the

is like the Son of God.

3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the @P of the burning fiery
furnace, and @0, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye
@<s of the most high God, come @, and come hither. Then
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came @ of the @a of the fire.

3:27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's

the fire had no power, nor was an hair of @ head singed, @"
were @ coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar @0, and said, Blessed be the God of

delivered his @<s that trusted in him, and have changed the

3:29 @N I make a decree, That @ @, nation, and

3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the

4:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all @, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the @; Peace be multiplied unto you.

4:2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God

4:3 How @ are his signs! and how @By are his wonders! his

4:4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine @, and flourishing in my

4:6 @N made I a decree to @( in all the wise men of Babylon

4:7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and

4:8 But at the last Daniel came in @	 me, whose name was

unto @1, and the sight @of to the end of all the @: 4:12
The leaves @of were fair, and the fruit @of much, and in it
was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow @[ it, and the
fowls of the @1 dwelt in the boughs @of, and all @R was fed
of it.

4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, @%, a
watcher and an holy one came down from @1; 4:14 He cried aloud,
and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off
his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from @[
it, and the fowls from his branches: 4:15 Nevertheless leave the stump
of his roots in the @, even with a band of iron and brass, in the
tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of @1,
and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the @: 4:16
Let his @ be changed from man's, and let a beast's @ be @=
unto him; and let @H times pass over him.

4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by
the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that
the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.

4:18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation @of, forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the
interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is
in thee.

4:19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king @0, and said,
Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation @of,
trouble thee. Belteshazzar @> and said, My lord, the dream be to
them that hate thee, and the interpretation @of to @ enemies.

4:20 The tree that thou sawest, @ grew, and was strong, whose
height reached unto the @1, and the sight @of to all the
@; 4:21 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit @of much, and in
it was meat for all; @[ @ the beasts of the field dwelt, and
upon whose branches the fowls of the @1 had @ habitation: 4:22
It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
@ness is grown, and reacheth unto @1, and thy dominion to the
end of the @.

4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
from @1, and @, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave
the stump of the roots @of in the @, even with a band of iron
and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with
the dew of @1, and let his portion be with the beasts of the
field, till @H times pass over him; 4:24 This is the
interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, @
is come upon my lord the king: 4:25 That they @ drive thee from
men, and thy dwelling @ be with the beasts of the field, and they
@ make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they @ wet thee with the
dew of @1, and @H times @ pass over thee, till thou know
that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will.

4:26 And whereas they @M to leave the stump of the tree roots;
thy kingdom @ be sure unto thee, @ that thou @ have known
that the @1s do rule.

4:27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
break off thy sins by @ceousness, and @ iniquities by shewing
mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.

4:28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

4:29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
kingdom of Babylon.

4:30 The king @0, and said, Is not this @ Babylon, that I have
built for the @ of the kingdom by the @B of my power, and for
the honour of my majesty?  4:31 While the word was in the king's
@P, @ fell a @; from @1, @, O king Nebuchadnezzar,
to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

4:32 And they @ drive thee from men, and thy dwelling @ be
with the beasts of the field: they @ make thee to eat grass as
oxen, and @H times @ pass over thee, until thou know that the
most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
will.

4:33 The same hour was the @7 fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he
was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet
with the dew of @1, till his hairs were grown like eagles'
feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

4:34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
unto @1, and mine @[standing returned unto me, and I blessed
the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,
whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from
generation to generation: 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the @
are reputed as no@7: and he doeth @$ to his will in the army
of @1, and @ the inhabitants of the @: and none can stay
his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  4:36 At the same time my
reason returned unto me; and for the @Y of my kingdom, mine honour
and b@cness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords
sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent
majesty was added unto me.

4:37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
@1, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and @J
that walk in pride he is able to abase.

5:1 Belshazzar the king made a @ feast to a @: of his lords,
and drank wine @	 the @:.

5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, @M to @( the
golden and silver vessels @ his @ Nebuchadnezzar had taken
out of the temple @ was in @ ; that the king, and his
princes, his wives, and his concubines, @B @b @in.

5:3 Then they @ the golden vessels that were taken out of the
temple of the @ of God @ was at @ ; and the king, and
his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.

5:4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

5:5 In the same hour came @ fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
over @
 the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

5:6 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote
one @
 @F.

5:7 The king cried aloud to @( in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers. And the king @0, and said to the wise men of
Babylon, Whosoever @ read this writing, and shew me the
interpretation @of, @ be clothed with scarlet, and have a
chain of gold @+ his neck, and @ be the third ruler in the
kingdom.

5:8 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the
writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation @of.

5:9 Then was king Belshazzar @ly troubled, and his countenance was
changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

5:10 Now the queen by reason of the @5 of the king and his lords
came into the banquet @: and the queen @0 and said, O king,
live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy
countenance be changed: 5:11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy @ light and
@[standing and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was @V in
him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy @, the king, I say, thy
@, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and
soothsayers; 5:12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
@[standing, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences,
and dissolving of doubts, were @V in the same Daniel, whom the king
named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be @,, and he will shew the
interpretation.

5:13 Then was Daniel @ in @	 the king. And the king @0
and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, @ art of the @
of the captivity of @, whom the king my @ @ out of
Jewry?  5:14 I have even @) of thee, that the spirit of the gods is
in thee, and that light and @[standing and excellent wisdom is
@V in thee.

5:15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been @ in
@	 me, that they @# read this writing, and make known unto me
the interpretation @of: but they could not shew the interpretation
of the @7: 5:16 And I have @) of thee, that thou canst make
interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
writing, and make known to me the interpretation @of, thou @
be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold @+ thy neck, and
@ be the third ruler in the kingdom.

5:17 Then Daniel @> and said @	 the king, Let thy gifts be
to thyself, and give thy rewards to @F; yet I will read the
writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

5:18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy @ a
kingdom, and majesty, and @Y, and honour: 5:19 And for the majesty
that he gave him, all @, nations, and languages, trembled and
feared @	 him: whom he @L he slew; and whom he @L he kept
alive; and whom he @L he set up; and whom he @L he put down.

5:20 But when his @ was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his @Y from
him: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his @ was
made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they
fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of
@1; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of
men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.

5:22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled @ @,
though thou knewest all this; 5:23 But hast lifted up thyself @

the Lord of @1; and they have @ the vessels of his @
@	 thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines,
have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, @ see not, nor hear, nor
know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy
ways, hast thou not glorified: 5:24 Then was the part of the hand sent
from him; and this writing was written.

5:25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.

5:26 This is the interpretation of the @7: MENE; God hath numbered
thy kingdom, and finished it.

5:27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art @V wanting.

5:28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and @= to the Medes and
Persians.

5:29 Then @M Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
and put a chain of gold @+ his neck, and made a proclamation
concerning him, that he @# be the third ruler in the kingdom.

5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being @+ @@score
and two @8 old.

6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an @/ and twenty
princes, @ @# be over the whole kingdom; 6:2 And over @
@@ presidents; of whom Daniel was @O: that the princes @B
give accounts unto them, and the king @# have no damage.

6:3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
@ an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set
him over the whole realm.

6:4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion @

Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor
fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, @" was @ any error or
fault @V in him.

6:5 Then said @ men, We @ not find any occasion @
 this
Daniel, except we find it @
 him concerning the law of his God.

6:6 Then @ presidents and princes assembled @? to the king,
and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted @? to
establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever
@ ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee,
O king, he @ be cast into the den of lions.

6:8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it
be not changed, @$ to the law of the Medes and Persians, @
altereth not.

6:9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
his @; and his windows being open in his chamber toward @ ,
he kneeled upon his knees @@ times a day, and prayed, and gave
thanks @	 his God, as he did aforetime.

6:11 Then @ men assembled, and @V Daniel praying and making
supplication @	 his God.

6:12 Then they came near, and @0 @	 the king concerning the
king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that @ man that
@ ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of
thee, O king, @ be cast into the den of lions? The king @>
and said, The @7 is true, @$ to the law of the Medes and
Persians, @ altereth not.

6:13 Then @> they and said @	 the king, That Daniel, @
is of the @ of the captivity of @, regardeth not thee, O
king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition
@@ times a day.

6:14 Then the king, when he @) @ @5, was sore displeased
with @9, and set his @ on Daniel to deliver him: and he
laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

6:15 Then @ men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,
Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no
decree nor statute @ the king establisheth may be changed.

6:16 Then the king @M, and they @ Daniel, and cast him
into the den of lions. Now the king @0 and said unto Daniel, Thy
God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.

6:17 And a stone was @, and laid upon the @P of the den; and
the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his
lords; that the purpose @B not be changed concerning Daniel.

6:18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
@" were instruments of musick @ @	 him: and his sleep
went from him.

6:19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
unto the den of lions.

6:20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable @;
unto Daniel: and the king @0 and said to Daniel, O Daniel, @<
of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to
deliver thee from the lions?  6:21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O
king, live for ever.

6:22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' @Ps, that
they have not hurt me: forasmuch as @	 him innocency was @V in
me; and also @	 thee, O king, have I done no hurt.

6:23 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and @M that
they @# take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out
of the den, and no manner of hurt was @V upon him, @ he
believed in his God.

6:24 And the king @M, and they @ @J men @ had
accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, @
@, and @ wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and
brake all @ bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the
den.

6:25 Then king Darius wrote unto all @, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the @; Peace be multiplied unto you.

6:26 I make a decree, That in @ dominion of my kingdom men tremble
and fear @	 the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and
stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that @ @ not be destroyed,
and his dominion @ be even unto the end.

6:27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in
@1 and in @, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the
lions.

6:28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign
of Cyrus the Persian.

7:1 In the @O year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and
told the sum of the matters.

7:2 Daniel @0 and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, @%,
the four winds of the @1 strove upon the @ sea.

7:3 And four @ beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
@F.

7:4 The @O was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till
the wings @of were plucked, and it was lifted up from the @,
and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's @ was @= to
it.

7:5 And @% @F beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
up itself on one side, and it had @@ ribs in the @P of it
between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour
much @R.

7:6 After this I beheld, and lo @F, like a leopard, @ had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four
heads; and dominion was @= to it.

7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and @% a fourth beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had @ iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
@	 it; and it had ten horns.

7:8 I considered the horns, and, @%, @ came up @ them
@F little horn, @	 whom @ were @@ of the @O horns
plucked up by the roots: and, @%, in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man, and a @P @King @ @.

7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his
wheels as burning fire.

7:10 A fiery stream issued and came @ from @	 him: @:
@:s ministered unto him, and ten @: times ten @:
stood @	 him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.

7:11 I beheld then @ of the @; of the @ @5 @ the
horn @0: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and @= to the burning flame.

7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had @ dominion
taken away: yet @ lives were prolonged for a season and time.

7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, @%, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of @1, and came to the Ancient of days, and
they @ him near @	 him.

7:14 And @ was @= him dominion, and @Y, and a kingdom, that
all @, nations, and languages, @# serve him: his dominion is
an everlasting dominion, @ @ not pass away, and his kingdom
that @ @ not be destroyed.

7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the @a of my body, and
the visions of my head troubled me.

7:16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation
of the @.

7:17 These @ beasts, @ are four, are four kings, @ @
arise out of the @.

7:18 But the saints of the most High @ take the kingdom, and
possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

7:19 Then I @L know the truth of the fourth beast, @ was
diverse from all the @Cs, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of
iron, and his nails of brass; @ devoured, brake in pieces, and
stamped the residue with his feet; 7:20 And of the ten horns that were
in his head, and of the @C @ came up, and @	 whom @@
fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a @P that @0 very
@ @, whose look was more stout than his fellows.

7:21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
prevailed @
 them; 7:22 Until the Ancient of days came, and
judgment was @= to the saints of the most High; and the time came
that the saints possessed the kingdom.

7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast @ be the fourth kingdom upon
@, @ @ be diverse from all kingdoms, and @ devour the
whole @, and @ tread it down, and break it in pieces.

7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that @
arise: and @F @ rise @ them; and he @ be diverse from
the @O, and he @ subdue @@ kings.

7:25 And he @ @K @ @5 @
 the most High, and @
wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and
laws: and they @ be @= into his hand until a time and times and
the dividing of time.

7:26 But the judgment @ sit, and they @ take away his
dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

7:27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the @ness of the kingdom
@[ the whole @1, @ be @= to the @ of the saints of
the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all
dominions @ serve and obey him.

7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I
kept the matter in my @.

8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, @ that @ appeared unto
me at the @O.

8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
at Shushan in the palace, @ is in the province of Elam; and I saw
in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, @%, @ stood
@	 the river a ram @ had two horns: and the two horns were
high; but one was higher than the @C, and the higher came up last.

8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
that no beasts @B stand @	 him, @" was @ any that
could deliver out of his hand; but he did @$ to his will, and
became @.

8:5 And as I was considering, @%, an he goat came from the west on
the face of the whole @, and touched not the ground: and the goat
had a notable horn between his eyes.

8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, @ I had seen
standing @	 the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.

8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
choler @
 him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and
@ was no power in the ram to stand @	 him, but he cast him
down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and @ was none that
could deliver the ram out of his hand.

8:8 @N the he goat waxed very @: and when he was strong,
the @ horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward
the four winds of @1.

8:9 And out of one of them came @ a little horn, @ waxed
exceeding @, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
pleasant land.

8:10 And it waxed @, even to the host of @1; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
them.

8:11 Yea, he magnified @9 even to the prince of the host, and by
him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the @' of the sanctuary
was cast down.

8:12 And an host was @= him @
 the daily sacrifice by reason
of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practised, and prospered.

8:13 Then I @) one saint @King, and @F saint said unto that
certain saint @ @0, How long @ be the vision concerning the
daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden @[ foot?  8:14 And he said
unto me, Unto two @: and @@ @/ days; then @ the
sanctuary be cleansed.

8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
and sought for the meaning, then, @%, @ stood @	 me as the
appearance of a man.

8:16 And I @) a man's @; between the banks of Ulai, @
@,, and said, Gabriel, make this man to @[stand the vision.

8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man:
for at the time of the end @ be the vision.

8:18 Now as he was @King with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me up@c.

8:19 And he said, @., I will make thee know what @ be in the
last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end @
be.

8:20 The ram @ thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
and Persia.

8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the @ horn that
is between his eyes is the @O king.

8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
kingdoms @ stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.

8:23 And in the latter time of @ kingdom, when the transgressors
are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and @[standing
dark sentences, @ stand up.

8:24 And his power @ be @By, but not by his own power: and he
@ destroy wonderfully, and @ prosper, and practise, and @
destroy the @By and the holy @.

8:25 And @E his policy also he @ cause craft to prosper in
his hand; and he @ magnify @9 in his @, and by @U
@ destroy many: he @ also stand up @
 the Prince of
princes; but he @ be broken @S hand.

8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning @ was told is
true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it @ be for many
days.

8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; @ward I rose
up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision,
but none @[stood it.

9:1 In the @O year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
the Medes, @ was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 9:2 In
the @O year of his reign I Daniel @[stood by books the number of
the @8, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet,
that he @L accomplish @Hty @8 in the desolations of
@ .

9:3 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 9:4 And I
prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord,
the @ and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them
that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; 9:5 We have
sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have
rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
9:6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy @<s the prophets, @
@0 in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our @s, and to
all the @ of the land.

9:7 O LORD, @ceousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
of faces, as at this day; to the men of @, and to the inhabitants
of @ , and unto all @, that are near, and that are far
off, @E all the countries whither thou hast driven them, @
of @ trespass that they have trespassed @
 thee.

9:8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
princes, and to our @s, @ we have sinned @
 thee.

9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and for@=esses, though we
have rebelled @
 him; 9:10 Neither have we obeyed the @; of
the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, @ he set @	 us by his
@<s the prophets.

9:11 Yea, all @ have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
that they @B not obey thy @;; @fore the curse is poured upon
us, and the oath that is written in the law of @ the @< of
God, @ we have sinned @
 him.

9:12 And he hath confirmed his @5, @ he @0 @
 us, and
@
 our judges that judged us, by @(ing upon us a @ evil:
for @[ the whole @1 hath not been done as hath been done upon

9:13 As it is written in the law of @, all this evil is come upon
us: yet made we not our prayer @	 the LORD our God, that we @B
turn from our iniquities, and @[stand thy truth.

9:14 @N hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and @ it
upon us: for the LORD our God is @ceous in all his works @ he
doeth: for we obeyed not his @;.

9:15 And now, O Lord our God, that hast @ thy @ @ out
of the land of @- with a @By hand, and hast gotten thee renown,
as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.

9:16 O LORD, @$ to all thy @ceousness, I beseech thee, let
@ anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city @ , thy
holy mountain: @ for our sins, and for the iniquities of our
@s, @  and thy @ are become a reproach to all that
are @+ us.

9:17 Now @fore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy @<, and his
supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate, for the Lord's sake.

9:18 O my God, incline @ ear, and hear; open @ eyes, and
@% our desolations, and the city @ is @, by thy name: for
we do not present our supplications @	 thee for our
@ceousnesses, but for thy @ mercies.

9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
for @ own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy @ are @,
by thy name.

9:20 And whiles I was @King, and praying, and confessing my sin and
the sin of my @ @, and presenting my supplication @	 the
LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 9:21 Yea, whiles I was
@King in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me @+
the time of the evening oblation.

9:22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am
now come @ to give thee skill and @[standing.

9:23 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came @,
and I am come to shew thee; for thou art @ly beloved: @fore
@[stand the matter, and consider the vision.

9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy @ and upon thy holy
city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to
make reconciliation for iniquity, and to @( in everlasting
@ceousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint
the most Holy.

9:25 Know @fore and @[stand, that from the going @ of the
commandment to restore and to build @  unto the Messiah the
Prince @ be @H weeks, and @@score and two weeks: the street
@ be built @*, and the wall, even in troublous times.

9:26 And @ @@score and two weeks @ Messiah be cut off, but
not for @9: and the @ of the prince that @ come @
destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end @of @ be with
a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.

9:27 And he @ confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in
the @a of the week he @ cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he @ make it
desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined @ be
poured upon the desolate.

10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a @7 was revealed
unto Daniel, whose name was @, Belteshazzar; and the @7 was
true, but the time appointed was long: and he @[stood the @7,
and had @[standing of the vision.

10:2 In @J days I Daniel was mourning @@ full weeks.

10:3 I ate no pleasant @d, @" came @R nor wine in my @P,
@" did I anoint myself at all, till @@ whole weeks were
fulfilled.

10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the @O month, as I was by
the side of the @ river, @ is Hiddekel; 10:5 Then I lifted up
mine eyes, and looked, and @% a certain man clothed in linen,
whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 10:6 His body also
was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and
his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to
polished brass, and the @; of his @5 like the @; of a
multitude.

10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision; but a @ quaking fell upon them, so that they
fled to hide @T.

10:8 @N I was left alone, and saw this @ vision, and @
remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption, and I retained no strength.

10:9 Yet @) I the @; of his @5: and when I @) the @; of
his @5, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward
the ground.

10:10 And, @%, an hand touched me, @ set me upon my knees and
upon the palms of my @D.

10:11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man @ly beloved, @[stand
the @5 that I @K unto thee, and stand up@c: for unto thee am
I now sent.

And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.

10:12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the @O day
that thou didst set @ @ to @[stand, and to chasten thyself
@	 thy God, thy @5 were @), and I am come for thy @5.

10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained @ with the kings of Persia.

10:14 Now I am come to make thee @[stand what @ befall thy
@ in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.

10:15 And when he had spoken such @5 unto me, I set my face toward
the ground, and I became dumb.

10:16 And, @%, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
my lips: then I opened my @P, and @0, and said unto him that
stood @	 me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
me, and I have retained no strength.

10:17 For how can the @< of this my lord talk with this my lord?
for as for me, straightway @ remained no strength in me, @"
is @ breath left in me.

10:18 Then @ came @* and touched me one like the appearance of
a man, and he strengthened me, 10:19 And said, O man @ly beloved,
fear not: @U be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he
had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord @K;
for thou hast strengthened me.

10:20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone
@, lo, the prince of Grecia @ come.

10:21 But I will shew thee that @ is noted in the scripture of
truth: and @ is none that holdeth with me in @ @, but
Michael your prince.

11:1 Also I in the @O year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
confirm and to strengthen him.

11:2 And now will I shew thee the truth. @., @ @ stand up
yet @@ kings in Persia; and the fourth @ be far richer than
they all: and by his strength @E his riches he @ stir up all
@
 the realm of Grecia.

11:3 And a @By king @ stand up, that @ rule with @
dominion, and do @$ to his will.

11:4 And when he @ stand up, his kingdom @ be broken, and
@ be divided toward the four winds of @1; and not to his
posterity, nor @$ to his dominion @ he ruled: for his
kingdom @ be plucked up, even for @Cs beside @J.

11:5 And the king of the south @ be strong, and one of his
princes; and he @ be strong above him, and have dominion; his
dominion @ be a @ dominion.

11:6 And in the end of @8 they @ join @T @?; for
the king's daughter of the south @ come to the king of the north
to make an agreement: but she @ not retain the power of the arm;
@" @ he stand, nor his arm: but she @ be @= up, and
they that @ her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened
her in @ times.

11:7 But out of a branch of her roots @ one stand up in his
estate, @ @ come with an army, and @ enter into the
fortress of the king of the north, and @ deal @
 them, and
@ prevail: 11:8 And @ also carry captives into @- @
gods, with @ princes, and with @ precious vessels of silver
and of gold; and he @ continue more @8 than the king of the
north.

11:9 So the king of the south @ come into his kingdom, and @
return into his own land.

11:10 But his sons @ be stirred up, and @ assemble a multitude
of @ forces: and one @ certainly come, and overflow, and pass
@E: then @ he return, and be stirred up, even to his
fortress.

11:11 And the king of the south @ be moved with choler, and @
come @ and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he
@ set @ a @ multitude; but the multitude @ be @=
into his hand.

11:12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his @ @ be
lifted up; and he @ cast down many ten @:s: but he @ not
be strengthened by it.

11:13 For the king of the north @ return, and @ set @ a
multitude @er than the former, and @ certainly come @
certain @8 with a @ army and with much riches.

11:14 And in @J times @ @ many stand up @
 the king of
the south: also the robbers of thy @ @ exalt @T to
establish the vision; but they @ fall.

11:15 So the king of the north @ come, and cast up a mount, and
take the most fenced @G: and the arms of the south @ not
withstand, @" his chosen @, @" @ @ be any
strength to withstand.

11:16 But he that cometh @
 him @ do @$ to his own
will, and none @ stand @	 him: and he @ stand in the
glorious land, @ by his hand @ be consumed.

11:17 He @ also set his face to enter with the strength of his
whole kingdom, and up@c ones with him; thus @ he do: and he
@ give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she @
not stand on his side, @" be for him.

11:18 After this @ he turn his face unto the isles, and @ take
many: but a prince for his own behalf @ cause the reproach offered
by him to cease; @S his own reproach he @ cause it to turn
upon him.

11:19 Then he @ turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but
he @ stumble and fall, and not be @V.

11:20 Then @ stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the @Y
of the kingdom: but within few days he @ be destroyed, @" in
anger, nor in battle.

11:21 And in his estate @ stand up a vile person, to whom they
@ not give the honour of the kingdom: but he @ come in
@Uably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

11:22 And with the arms of a flood @ they be overflown from @	
him, and @ be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.

11:23 And @ the league made with him he @ work deceitfully:
for he @ come up, and @ become strong with a small @.

11:24 He @ enter @Uably even upon the fattest @'s of the
province; and he @ do that @ his @s have not done, nor
his @s' @s; he @ scatter @ them the prey, and spoil,
and riches: yea, and he @ forecast his devices @
 the strong
holds, even for a time.

11:25 And he @ stir up his power and his courage @
 the king
of the south with a @ army; and the king of the south @ be
stirred up to battle with a very @ and @By army; but he @
not stand: for they @ forecast devices @
 him.

11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat @ destroy
him, and his army @ overflow: and many @ fall down slain.

11:27 And both of @ kings' @s @ be to do mischief, and
they @ @K lies at one table; but it @ not prosper: for yet
the end @ be at the time appointed.

11:28 Then @ he return into his land with @ riches; and his
@ @ be @
 the holy covenant; and he @ do exploits,
and return to his own land.

11:29 At the time appointed he @ return, and come toward the
south; but it @ not be as the former, or as the latter.

11:30 For the ships of Chittim @ come @
 him: @fore he
@ be grieved, and return, and have indignation @
 the holy
covenant: so @ he do; he @ even return, and have intelligence
with them that forsake the holy covenant.

11:31 And arms @ stand on his part, and they @ pollute the
sanctuary of strength, and @ take away the daily sacrifice, and
they @ @' the abomination that maketh desolate.

11:32 And such as do wickedly @
 the covenant @ he corrupt by
flatteries: but the @ that do know @ God @ be strong, and
do exploits.

11:33 And they that @[stand @ the @ @ instruct many:
yet they @ fall by the @Q, and by flame, by captivity, and by
spoil, many days.

11:34 Now when they @ fall, they @ be holpen with a little
help: but many @ cleave to them with flatteries.

11:35 And some of them of @[standing @ fall, to try them, and
to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: @
it is yet for a time appointed.

11:36 And the king @ do @$ to his will; and he @ exalt
@9, and magnify @9 above @ god, and @ @K
marvellous @ @
 the God of gods, and @ prosper till the
indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined @ be
done.

11:37 Neither @ he regard the God of his @s, nor the desire
of women, nor regard any god: for he @ magnify @9 above all.

11:38 But in his estate @ he honour the God of forces: and a god
whom his @s knew not @ he honour with gold, and silver, and
with precious stones, and pleasant @.

11:39 Thus @ he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
whom he @ acknowledge and increase with @Y: and he @ cause
them to rule over many, and @ divide the land for gain.

11:40 And at the time of the end @ the king of the south push at
him: and the king of the north @ come @
 him like a
whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and
he @ enter into the countries, and @ overflow and pass over.

11:41 He @ enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
@ be overthrown: but @ @ escape out of his hand, even
Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the @ of Ammon.

11:42 He @ stretch @ his hand also upon the countries: and the
land of @- @ not escape.

11:43 But he @ have power over the treasures of gold and of
silver, and over all the precious @ of @-: and the Libyans and
the Ethiopians @ be at his steps.

11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north @ trouble
him: @fore he @ go @ with @ fury to destroy, and
utterly to make away many.

11:45 And he @ plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he @ come to his end, and
none @ help him.

12:1 And at that time @ Michael stand up, the @ prince @
standeth for the @ of thy @: and @ @ be a time of
trouble, such as never was since @ was a nation even to that same
time: and at that time thy @ @ be delivered, @ one that

12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the @ @ awake,
some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.

12:3 And they that be wise @ shine as the b@cness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to @ceousness as the stars for

12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the @5, and seal the book, even to
the time of the end: many @ run to and fro, and knowledge @ be
increased.

12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, @%, @ stood @C two, the one
on this side of the bank of the river, and the @C on that side of
the bank of the river.

12:6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, @ was upon the
@Zs of the river, How long @ it be to the end of @ wonders?
12:7 And I @) the man clothed in linen, @ was upon the @Zs
of the river, when he held up his @c hand and his left hand unto
@1, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it @ be for a

scatter the power of the holy @, all @ @ @ be
finished.

12:8 And I @), but I @[stood not: then said I, O my Lord, what
@ be the end of @ @?  12:9 And he said, Go thy way,
Daniel: for the @5 are closed up and sealed till the time of the
end.

12:10 Many @ be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
wicked @ do wickedly: and none of the wicked @ @[stand; but
the wise @ @[stand.

12:11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice @ be taken away,
and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, @ @ be a

12:12 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the @: @@

12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou @ rest,

Hosea


1:1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in
the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of @, and in
the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of @.

1:2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said
to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and @ of
whoredoms: for the land hath committed @ whoredom, departing from
the LORD.

1:3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; @
conceived, and bare him a son.

1:4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
little while, and I will avenge the @I of Jezreel upon the @ of
Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the @ of @.

1:5 And it @ come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow
of @, in the valley of Jezreel.

1:6 And she conceived @*, and bare a daughter. And God said unto
him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the
@ of @; but I will utterly take them away.

1:7 But I will have mercy upon the @ of @, and will save them
by the LORD @ God, and will not save them by bow, nor by @Q,
nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

1:8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.

1:9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my @, and
I will not be your God.

1:10 Yet the number of the @ of @ @ be as the sand of
the sea, @ cannot be measured nor numbered; and it @ come to
pass, that in the @' where it was said unto them, Ye are not my
@, @ it @ be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the
living God.

1:11 Then @ the @ of @ and the @ of @ be
ga@d @?, and appoint @T one head, and they @
come up out of the land: for @ @ be the day of Jezreel.

2:1 Say ye unto your @3, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

2:2 Plead with your m@C, plead: for she is not my wife, @" am
I her husband: let her @fore put away her whoredoms out of her
sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 2:3 Lest I strip
her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her
as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with
thirst.

2:4 And I will not have mercy upon her @; for they be the
@ of whoredoms.

2:5 For @ m@C hath played the harlot: she that conceived them
hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go @ my lovers, that
give me my @d and my @Z, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my
@b.

2:6 @N, @%, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a
wall, that she @ not find her paths.

2:7 And she @ follow @ her lovers, but she @ not overtake
them; and she @ seek them, but @ not find them: then @ she
say, I will go and return to my @O husband; for then was it better
with me than now.

2:8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
multiplied her silver and gold, @ they prepared for Baal.

2:9 @N will I return, and take away my corn in the time
@of, and my wine in the season @of, and will recover my wool
and my flax @= to cover her nakedness.

2:10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
and none @ deliver her out of mine hand.

2:11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new
moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

2:12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
said, These are my rewards that my lovers have @= me: and I will
make them a forest, and the beasts of the field @ eat them.

2:13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her
jewels, and she went @ her lovers, and forgat me, @
 the LORD.

2:14 @N, @%, I will allure her, and @( her into the
wilderness, and @K comfortably unto her.

2:15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of
Achor for a door of hope: and she @ sing @, as in the days of
her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
@-.

2:16 And it @ be at that day, @
 the LORD, that thou @ call
me Ishi; and @ call me no more Baali.

2:17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her @P, and
they @ no more be remembered by @ name.

2:18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
of the field and with the fowls of @1, and with the creeping
@ of the ground: and I will break the bow and the @Q and the
battle out of the @, and will make them to lie down safely.

2:19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
thee unto me in @ceousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness,
and in mercies.

2:20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou @
know the LORD.

2:21 And it @ come to pass in that day, I will hear, @
 the
LORD, I will hear the @1s, and they @ hear the @; 2:22 And
the @ @ hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they
@ hear Jezreel.

2:23 And I will sow her unto me in the @; and I will have mercy
upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them @
were not my @, Thou art my @; and they @ say, Thou art
my God.

3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her
friend, yet an adulteress, @$ to the love of the LORD toward
the @ of @, who look to @C gods, and love flagons of
wine.

3:2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 3:3 And I said unto her,
Thou @ abide for me many days; thou @ not play the harlot, and
thou @ not be for @F man: so will I also be for thee.

3:4 For the @ of @ @ abide many days @S a king,
and @S a prince, and @S a sacrifice, and @S an image,
and @S an ephod, and @S teraphim: 3:5 Afterward @ the
@ of @ return, and seek the LORD @ God, and @
@ king; and @ fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter
days.

4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye @ of @: for the LORD
hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, @ @ is
no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

4:2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
adultery, they break out, and @I toucheth @I.

4:3 @N @ the land mourn, and @ one that dwelleth
@in @ languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the
fowls of @1; yea, the fishes of the sea also @ be taken away.

4:4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove @F: for thy @ are as
they that strive with the @6.

4:5 @N @ thou fall in the day, and the prophet also @
fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy m@C.

4:6 My @ are destroyed for lack of knowledge: @ thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou @ be no
@6 to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will
also forget thy @.

4:7 As they were increased, so they sinned @
 me: @fore will
I change @ @Y into shame.

4:8 They eat up the sin of my @, and they set @ @ on
@ iniquity.

4:9 And @ @ be, like @, like @6: and I will punish
them for @ ways, and reward them @ doings.

4:10 For they @ eat, and not have enough: they @ commit
whoredom, and @ not increase: @ they have left off to take
heed to the LORD.

4:11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the @.

4:12 My @ ask counsel at @ stocks, and @ staff declareth
unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and
they have gone a whoring from @[ @ God.

4:13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense
upon the hills, @[ oaks and poplars and elms, @ the shadow
@of is good: @fore your daughters @ commit whoredom, and
your spouses @ commit adultery.

4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor
your spouses when they commit adultery: for @T are separated
with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: @fore the @
that doth not @[stand @ fall.

4:15 Though thou, @, play the harlot, yet let not @ offend;
and come not ye unto Gilgal, @" go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear,
The LORD liveth.

4:16 For @ slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
will feed them as a lamb in a large @'.

4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

4:18 Their @b is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

4:19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they @ be
ashamed @ of @ sacrifices.

5:1 Hear ye this, O @6s; and hearken, ye @ of @; and give
ye ear, O @ of the king; for judgment is toward you, @ ye
have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.

5:2 And the revolters are pro@V to make slaughter, though I have
been a rebuker of them all.

5:3 I know Ephraim, and @ is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
thou committest whoredom, and @ is defiled.

5:4 They will not frame @ doings to turn unto @ God: for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the @a of them, and they have not known
the LORD.

5:5 And the pride of @ doth testify to his face: @fore @
@ and Ephraim fall in @ iniquity: @ also @ fall with
them.

5:6 They @ go with @ flocks and with @ herds to seek the
LORD; but they @ not find him; he hath withdrawn @9 from
them.

5:7 They have dealt treacherously @
 the LORD: for they have
begotten strange @: now @ a month devour them with @
portions.

5:8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
at Bethaven, @ thee, O Benjamin.

5:9 Ephraim @ be desolate in the day of rebuke: @ the tribes
of @ have I made known that @ @ surely be.

5:10 The princes of @ were like them that remove the bound:
@fore I will pour out my wrath upon them like @Z.

5:11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, @ he willingly
walked @ the commandment.

5:12 @N will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the @ of
@ as rottenness.

5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and @ saw his wound, then went
Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal
you, nor cure you of your wound.

5:14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the
@ of @: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away,
and none @ rescue him.

5:15 I will go and return to my @', till they acknowledge @
offence, and seek my face: in @ affliction they will seek me
early.

6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he
will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise
us up, and we @ live in his sight.

6:3 Then @ we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going
@ is prepared as the morning; and he @ come unto us as the
rain, as the latter and former rain unto the @.

6:4 O Ephraim, what @ I do unto thee? O @, what @ I do
unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early
dew it goeth away.

6:5 @N have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by
the @5 of my @P: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth
@.

6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God
more than @_ @&s.

6:7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: @ have they
dealt treacherously @
 me.

6:8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with
@I.

6:9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of @6s
murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

6:10 I have seen an horrible @7 in the @ of @: @ is
the whoredom of Ephraim, @ is defiled.

6:11 Also, O @, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned
the captivity of my @.

7:1 When I @L have healed @, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood;
and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth @S.

7:2 And they consider not in @ @s that I remember all @
wickedness: now @ own doings have beset them @+; they are
@	 my face.

7:3 They make the king glad with @ wickedness, and the princes
with @ lies.

7:4 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
ceaseth from raising @ he hath kneaded the dough, until it be
leavened.

7:5 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

7:6 For they have made ready @ @ like an oven, whiles they lie
in wait: @ baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth
as a flaming fire.

7:7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured @ judges; all
@ kings are fallen: @ is none @ them that calleth unto me.

7:8 Ephraim, he hath mixed @9 @ the @; Ephraim is a cake
not turned.

7:9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,
gray hairs are here and @ upon him, yet he knoweth not.

7:10 And the pride of @ testifieth to his face: and they do not
return to the LORD @ God, nor seek him for all this.

7:11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove @S @: they call to
@-, they go to Assyria.

7:12 When they @ go, I will spread my net upon them; I will @(
them down as the fowls of the @1; I will chastise them, as @
@` hath @).

7:13 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!
@ they have transgressed @
 me: though I have redeemed
them, yet they have spoken lies @
 me.

7:14 And they have not cried unto me with @ @, when they
howled upon @ beds: they assemble @T for corn and wine,
and they rebel @
 me.

7:15 Though I have bound and strengthened @ arms, yet do they
imagine mischief @
 me.

7:16 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful
bow: @ princes @ fall by the @Q for the rage of @
tongue: this @ be @ derision in the land of @-.

8:1 Set the trumpet to thy @P. He @ come as an eagle @

the @ of the LORD, @ they have transgressed my covenant, and
trespassed @
 my law.

8:2 @ @ cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

8:3 @ hath cast off the @7 that is good: the enemy @
pursue him.

8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and
I knew it not: of @ silver and @ gold have they made them
idols, that they may be cut off.

8:5 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
@
 them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?  8:6
For from @ was it also: the workman made it; @fore it is not
God: but the calf of Samaria @ be broken in pieces.

8:7 For they have sown the wind, and they @ reap the whirlwind: it
hath no stalk; the bud @ yield no meal: if so be it yield, the
strangers @ swallow it up.

8:8 @ is swallowed up: now @ they be @ the Gentiles as a
vessel wherein is no pleasure.

8:9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by @9:
Ephraim hath hired lovers.

8:10 Yea, though they have hired @ the nations, now will I gather
them, and they @ sorrow a little for the burden of the king of
princes.

8:11 Because Ephraim hath made many @\s to sin, @\s @ be
unto him to sin.

8:12 I have written to him the @ @ of my law, but they were
counted as a strange @7.

8:13 They sacrifice @R for the sacrifices of mine @&s, and
eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember @
iniquity, and visit @ sins: they @ return to @-.

8:14 For @ hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
@ hath multiplied fenced @G: but I will send a fire upon his
@G, and it @ devour the palaces @of.

9:1 Rejoice not, O @, for joy, as @C @: for thou hast
gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon @
cornfloor.

9:2 The floor and the winepress @ not feed them, and the new wine
@ fail in her.

9:3 They @ not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim @ return
to @-, and they @ eat unclean @ in Assyria.

9:4 They @ not offer wine @&s to the LORD, @" @
they be pleasing unto him: @ sacrifices @ be unto them as the
@d of mourners; all that eat @of @ be polluted: for @
@d for @ soul @ not come into the @ of the LORD.

9:5 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of
the LORD?  9:6 For, lo, they are gone @ of destruction: @-
@ gather them up, Memphis @ bury them: the pleasant @'s for
@ silver, nettles @ possess them: thorns @ be in @
tabernacles.

9:7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come;
@ @ know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad,
for the multitude of @ iniquity, and the @ hatred.

9:8 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the @ of his God.

9:9 They have deeply corrupted @T, as in the days of Gibeah:
@fore he will remember @ iniquity, he will visit @ sins.

9:10 I @V @ like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your @s
as the @Oripe in the fig tree at her @O time: but they went to
Baalpeor, and separated @T unto that shame; and @
abominations were @$ as they loved.

9:11 As for Ephraim, @ @Y @ fly away like a bird, from the
birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

9:12 Though they @( up @ @, yet will I bereave them,
that @ @ not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I
depart from them!  9:13 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a
pleasant @': but Ephraim @ @( @ his @ to the
murderer.

9:14 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying
womb and dry breasts.

9:15 All @ wickedness is in Gilgal: for @ I hated them: for
the wickedness of @ doings I will drive them out of mine @, I
will love them no more: all @ princes are revolters.

9:16 Ephraim is smitten, @ root is dried up, they @ bear no
fruit: yea, though they @( @, yet will I slay even the beloved
fruit of @ womb.

9:17 My God will cast them away, @ they did not hearken unto
him: and they @ be wanderers @ the nations.

10:1 @ is an empty vine, he @(eth @ fruit unto @9:
@$ to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the @\s;
@$ to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.

10:2 Their @ is divided; now @ they be @V faulty: he @
break down @ @\s, he @ spoil @ images.

10:3 For now they @ say, We have no king, @ we feared not
the LORD; what then @# a king do to us?  10:4 They have spoken
@5, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth
up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria @ fear @ of the calves of
Bethaven: for the @ @of @ mourn over it, and the @6s
@of that rejoiced on it, for the @Y @of, @ it is
departed from it.

10:6 It @ be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
Jareb: Ephraim @ receive shame, and @ @ be ashamed of his
own counsel.

10:7 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the @Z.

10:8 The high @'s also of Aven, the sin of @, @ be
destroyed: the thorn and the thistle @ come up on @ @\s;
and they @ say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall
on us.

10:9 O @, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: @ they
stood: the battle in Gibeah @
 the @ of iniquity did not
overtake them.

10:10 It is in my desire that I @# chastise them; and the @
@ be ga@d @
 them, when they @ bind @T in
@ two furrows.

10:11 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread
out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make
Ephraim to ride; @ @ plow, and @] @ break his clods.

10:12 Sow to yourselves in @ceousness, reap in mercy; break up your
fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain
@ceousness upon you.

10:13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
eaten the fruit of lies: @ thou didst trust in thy way, in the
multitude of thy @By men.

10:14 @N @ a tumult arise @ thy @, and all thy
fortresses @ be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day
of battle: the m@C was dashed in pieces upon her @.

10:15 So @ Bethel do unto you @ of your @ wickedness: in
a morning @ the king of @ utterly be cut off.

11:1 When @ was a child, then I loved him, and @, my son out
of @-.

11:2 As they @, them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto
Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

11:3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by @ arms; but they
knew not that I healed them.

11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to
them as they that take off the yoke on @ jaws, and I laid meat
unto them.

11:5 He @ not return into the land of @-, and the Assyrian
@ be his king, @ they refused to return.

11:6 And the @Q @ abide on his @G, and @ consume his
branches, and devour them, @ of @ own counsels.

11:7 And my @ are bent to backsliding from me: though they @,
them to the most High, none at all @L exalt him.

11:8 How @ I give thee up, Ephraim? how @ I deliver thee,
@?  how @ I make thee as Admah? how @ I set thee as
Zeboim? mine @ is turned within me, my repentings are kindled
@?.

11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in
the @a of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

11:10 They @ walk @ the LORD: he @ roar like a lion: when
he @ roar, then the @ @ tremble from the west.

11:11 They @ tremble as a bird out of @-, and as a dove out of
the land of Assyria: and I will @' them in @ @s, @
 the
LORD.

11:12 Ephraim compasseth me @+ with lies, and the @ of @
with deceit: but @ yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the
saints.

12:1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth @ the east wind: he
daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with
the Assyrians, and oil is carried into @-.

12:2 The LORD hath also a controversy with @, and will punish
@] @$ to his ways; @$ to his doings will he
recompense him.

12:3 He took his @X by the heel in the womb, and by his strength
he had power with God: 12:4 Yea, he had power over the angel, and
prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he @V him in
Bethel, and @ he @0 with us; 12:5 Even the LORD God of hosts;
the LORD is his memorial.

12:6 @N turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait
on thy God continually.

12:7 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
loveth to oppress.

12:8 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have @V me out
substance: in all my labours they @ find none iniquity in me that
were sin.

12:9 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of @- will yet
make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.

12:10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.

12:11 Is @ iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, @ @\s are as heaps in the
furrows of the fields.

12:12 And @] fled into the country of Syria, and @ served for
a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

12:13 And by a prophet the LORD @ @ out of @-, and by a
prophet was he preserved.

12:14 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: @fore @ he
leave his @I upon him, and his reproach @ his LORD return unto
him.

13:1 When Ephraim @0 trembling, he exalted @9 in @; but
when he offended in Baal, he died.

13:2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images
of @ silver, and idols @$ to @ own @[standing, all
of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that
sacrifice kiss the calves.

13:3 @N they @ be as the morning cloud and as the early dew
that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out
of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

13:4 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of @-, and thou @
know no god but me: for @ is no saviour beside me.

13:5 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of @ drought.

13:6 According to @ pasture, so were they filled; they were
filled, and @ @ was exalted; @fore have they forgotten me.

13:7 @N I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way
will I observe them: 13:8 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved
of her whelps, and will rend the caul of @ @, and @ will I
devour them like a lion: the wild beast @ tear them.

13:9 O @, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is @ help.

13:10 I will be thy king: where is any @C that may save thee in all
thy @G? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and
princes?  13:11 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in
my wrath.

13:12 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

13:13 The sorrows of a travailing woman @ come upon him: he is an
unwise son; for he @# not stay long in the @' of the breaking
@ of @.

13:14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
them from @^: O @^, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be
thy destruction: repentance @ be hid from mine eyes.

13:15 Though he be fruitful @ his @3, an east wind @
come, the wind of the LORD @ come up from the wilderness, and his
spring @ become dry, and his fountain @ be dried up: he @
spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

13:16 Samaria @ become desolate; for she hath rebelled @
 her
God: they @ fall by the @Q: @ infants @ be dashed in
pieces, and @ women with child @ be ripped up.

14:1 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by
@ iniquity.

14:2 Take with you @5, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the
calves of our lips.

14:3 Asshur @ not save us; we will not ride upon horses: @"
will we say any more to the work of our @D, Ye are our gods: for in
thee the @less findeth mercy.

14:4 I will heal @ backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
anger is turned away from him.

14:5 I will be as the dew unto @: he @ grow as the lily, and
cast @ his roots as Lebanon.

14:6 His branches @ spread, and his beauty @ be as the olive
tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

14:7 They that dwell @[ his shadow @ return; they @ revive
as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent @of @ be as the

14:8 Ephraim @ say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have
@) him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is
thy fruit @V.

14:9 Who is wise, and he @ @[stand @ @? prudent, and

@ walk in them: but the transgressors @ fall @in.




Joel


1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

1:2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.

Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your @s?  1:3
Tell ye your @ of it, and let your @ tell @

1:4 That @ the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
that @ the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that

1:5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye @bers of wine,
@ of the new wine; for it is cut off from your @P.

1:6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and @S number,
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a

1:7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made

1:8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her

1:9 The meat @& and the @b @& is cut off from the @

1:10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:

1:11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the
wheat and for the barley; @ the harvest of the field is
perished.

1:12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the

1:13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye @6s: howl, ye ministers of

1:14 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and

1:18 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,

1:19 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the

1:20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of

2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy

2:7 They @ run like @By men; they @ climb the wall like men

2:9 They @ run to and fro in the city; they @ run upon the

2:17 Let the @6s, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the

2:18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his @.

2:19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his @, @., I will

2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do @

2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the

2:23 Be glad then, ye @ of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your

3:4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all

3:9 Proclaim ye this @ the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the

Beat your plowshares into @Qs and your pruninghooks into spears:

6:11 For, @%, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the @
@ with breaches, and the little @ with clefts.

6:12 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow @ with oxen?
for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of @ceousness
into hemlock: 6:13 Ye @ rejoice in a @7 of nought, @ say,
Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?  6:14 But, @%,
I will raise up @
 you a nation, O @ of @, @
 the
LORD the God of hosts; and they @ afflict you from the entering in
of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

7:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, @%, he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, lo, it was the latter growth @ the king's mowings.

7:2 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee:
by whom @ @] arise? for he is small.

7:3 The LORD repented for this: It @ not be, @
 the LORD.

7:4 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, @%, the Lord GOD
@, to contend by fire, and it devoured the @ deep, and did eat
up a part.

7:5 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom @
@] arise? for he is small.

7:6 The LORD repented for this: This also @ not be, @
 the Lord
GOD.

7:7 Thus he shewed me: and, @%, the LORD stood upon a wall made by
a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

7:8 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A
plumbline. Then said the LORD, @., I will set a plumbline in the
@a of my @ @: I will not @* pass by them any more: 7:9
And the high @'s of Isaac @ be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
@ @ be laid waste; and I will rise @
 the @ of
Jeroboam with the @Q.

7:10 Then Amaziah the @6 of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
@, @, Amos hath conspired @
 thee in the @a of the
@ of @: the land is not able to bear all his @5.

7:11 For thus Amos @
, Jeroboam @ die by the @Q, and @
@ surely be led away captive out of @ own land.

7:12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into
the land of @, and @ eat @d, and prophesy @: 7:13 But
prophesy not @* any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel,
and it is the king's court.

7:14 Then @> Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
@" was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a ga@r of
sycomore fruit: 7:15 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and
the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my @ @.

7:16 Now @fore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
Prophesy not @
 @, and drop not thy word @
 the @

7:17 @N thus @
 the LORD; Thy wife @ be an harlot in the
city, and thy sons and thy daughters @ fall by the @Q, and thy
land @ be divided by line; and thou @ die in a polluted land:
and @ @ surely go into captivity @ of his land.

8:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and @% a basket of
summer fruit.

8:2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer
fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my @ of
@; I will not @* pass by them any more.

8:3 And the songs of the temple @ be howlings in that day, @

the Lord GOD: @ @ be many dead bodies in @ @'; they
@ cast them @ with silence.

8:4 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor
of the land to fail, 8:5 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that
we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set @ wheat, making
the ephah small, and the shekel @, and falsifying the balances by
deceit?  8:6 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a
pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?  8:7 The LORD
hath sworn by the excellency of @], Surely I will never forget any
of @ works.

8:8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and @ one mourn that
dwelleth @in? and it @ rise up wholly as a flood; and it @
be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of @-.

8:9 And it @ come to pass in that day, @
 the Lord GOD, that I
will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the @ in
the clear day: 8:10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all
your songs into lamentation; and I will @( up sackcloth upon all
loins, and baldness upon @ head; and I will make it as the
mourning of an only son, and the end @of as a bitter day.

8:11 @., the days come, @
 the Lord GOD, that I will send a
famine in the land, not a famine of @d, nor a thirst for @Z, but
of hearing the @5 of the LORD: 8:12 And they @ wander from sea
to sea, and from the north even to the east, they @ run to and fro
to seek the word of the LORD, and @ not find it.

8:13 In that day @ the fair virgins and young men faint for
thirst.

8:14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,
liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they @ fall, and
never rise up @*.

9:1 I saw the LORD standing upon the @\: and he said, Smite the
lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the
head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the @Q: he
that fleeth of them @ not flee away, and he that escapeth of them
@ not be delivered.

9:2 Though they dig into hell, thence @ mine hand take them;
though they climb up to @1, thence will I @( them down: 9:3 And
though they hide @T in the top of Carmel, I will search and
take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the
bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he @
bite them: 9:4 And though they go into captivity @	 @ enemies,
thence will I command the @Q, and it @ slay them: and I will
set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

9:5 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it
@ melt, and all that dwell @in @ mourn: and it @ rise
up wholly like a flood; and @ be drowned, as by the flood of

9:6 It is he that buildeth his stories in the @1, and hath @Ved
his troop in the @; he that calleth for the @Zs of the sea, and
poureth them out upon the face of the @: The LORD is his name.

9:7 Are ye not as @ of the Ethiopians unto me, O @ of
@? @
 the LORD. Have not I @ up @ out of the land
of @-? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
9:8 @., the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and
I will destroy it from off the face of the @; saving that I will
not utterly destroy the @ of @], @
 the LORD.

9:9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the @ of @ @
all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet @ not the

9:10 All the sinners of my @ @ die by the @Q, @ say,
The evil @ not overtake nor prevent us.

9:11 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of @ that is
fallen, and close up the breaches @of; and I will raise up his
ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 9:12 That they may
possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, @ are @,
by my name, @
 the LORD that doeth this.

9:13 @., the days come, @
 the LORD, that the plowman @

and the mountains @ drop sweet wine, and all the hills @ melt.

9:14 And I will @( @* the captivity of my @ of @, and
they @ build the waste @G, and inhabit them; and they @

Obadiah


1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus @
 the Lord GOD concerning Edom;
We have @) a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent @
the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up @
 her in battle.

1:2 @., I have made thee small @ the heathen: thou art @ly
despised.

1:3 The pride of @ @ hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in

 in his
@, Who @ @( me down to the ground?  1:4 Though thou exalt
thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest @ the stars,
thence will I @( thee down, @
 the LORD.

1:5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut
off!)  @L they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
grapega@rs came to thee, @L they not leave some grapes?  1:6
How are the @ of Esau searched out! how are his hidden @

to the border: the men that were at @U with thee have deceived
thee, and prevailed @
 thee; that they eat thy @d have laid a
wound @[ thee: @ is none @[standing in him.

1:8 Shall I not in that day, @
 the LORD, even destroy the wise men
out of Edom, and @[standing out of the mount of Esau?  1:9 And thy
@By men, O Teman, @ be dismayed, to the end that @ one of
the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

1:10 For thy violence @
 thy @X @] shame @ cover

1:11 In the day that thou stoodest on the @C side, in the day that
the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered

them.

1:12 But thou @#est not have looked on the day of thy @X in
the day that he became a stranger; @" @#est thou have

@" @#est thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

1:13 Thou @#est not have entered into the gate of my @ in the

@" @#est thou have delivered up @J of his that did remain

1:15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou

1:16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so @ all the

1:17 But upon mount Zion @ be deliverance, and @ @ be

Jonah


1:1 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
@, 1:2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that @ city, and cry @
 it;
for @ wickedness is come up @	 me.

1:3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the
LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he @V a ship going to Tarshish:
so he paid the fare @of, and went down into it, to go with them
unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

1:4 But the LORD sent out a @ wind into the sea, and @ was a
@By tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried @ man unto his god,
and cast @ the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to
lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the
ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

1:6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will
think upon us, that we perish not.

1:7 And they said @ one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,
that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast
lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

1:8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause
this evil is upon us; What is @ occupation? and whence comest
thou? what is thy country? and of what @ art thou?  1:9 And he
said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of
@1, @ hath made the sea and the dry land.

1:10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast
thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the
LORD, @ he had told them.

1:11 Then said they unto him, What @ we do unto thee, that the sea
may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

1:12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me @ into the
sea; so @ the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake
this @ tempest is upon you.

1:13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to @( it to the land; but they
could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous @
 them.

1:14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O
LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay
not upon us innocent @I: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased
thee.

1:15 So they look up Jonah, and cast him @ into the sea: and the
sea ceased from her raging.

1:16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice
unto the LORD, and made vows.

1:17 Now the LORD had prepared a @ fish to swallow up Jonah. And
Jonah was in the belly of the fish @@ days and @@ nights.

2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
2:2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and
he @) me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou @)est my
@;.

2:3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the @a of the seas;
and the floods compassed me @+: all thy billows and thy waves
passed over me.

2:4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look @*
toward thy holy temple.

2:5 The @Zs compassed me @+, even to the soul: the depth closed
me round @+, the weeds were wrapped @+ my head.

2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the @ with her
bars was @+ me for ever: yet hast thou @ up my life from
corruption, O LORD my God.

2:7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
prayer came in unto thee, into @ holy temple.

2:8 They that observe lying vanities forsake @ own mercy.

2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the @; of thanksgiving; I
will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

2:10 And the LORD @0 unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry land.

3:1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, @,
3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that @ city, and preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee.

3:3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, @$ to the word of
the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding @ city of @@ days'
journey.

3:4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh @ be overthrown.

3:5 So the @ of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
put on sackcloth, from the @est of them even to the least of them.

3:6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,
and sat in ashes.

3:7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published @E Nineveh by
the decree of the king and his nobles, @, Let @" man nor
beast, herd nor flock, taste any @7: let them not feed, nor @b
@Z: 3:8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
@Bily unto God: yea, let them turn @ one from his evil way, and
from the violence that is in @ @D.

3:9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
fierce anger, that we perish not?  3:10 And God saw @ works, that
they turned from @ evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he
had said that he @L do unto them; and he did it not.

4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

4:2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was
not this my @, when I was yet in my country? @N I fled
@	 unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and
merciful, slow to anger, and of @ kindness, and repentest thee of
the evil.

4:3 @N now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for
it is better for me to die than to live.

4:4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?  4:5 So Jonah
went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and @
made him a booth, and sat @[ it in the shadow, till he @B see
what @L become of the city.

4:6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
Jonah, that it @B be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from
his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

4:7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it
smote the gourd that it wi@d.

4:8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a
vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he
fainted, and wished in @9 to die, and said, It is better for me
to die than to live.

4:9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?
And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto @^.

4:10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
@ thou hast not laboured, @" madest it grow; @ came up in
a night, and perished in a night: 4:11 And @# not I spare Nineveh,
that @ city, wherein are more then sixscore @: persons that
cannot discern between @ @c hand and @ left hand; and also
much cattle?




Micah


1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of @, @ he saw
concerning Samaria and @ .

1:2 Hear, all ye @; hearken, O @, and all that @in is:
and let the Lord GOD be witness @
 you, the LORD from his holy

1:3 For, @%, the LORD cometh @ out of his @', and will come

1:4 And the mountains @ be molten @[ him, and the valleys @
be cleft, as wax @	 the fire, and as the @Zs that are poured
down a steep @'.

1:5 For the transgression of @] is all this, and for the sins of
the @ of @. What is the transgression of @]? is it not
Samaria? and what are the high @'s of @? are they not
@ ?  1:6 @N I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,
and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
@of into the valley, and I will discover the @Vations @of.

1:7 And all the graven images @of @ be beaten to pieces, and
all the hires @of @ be burned with the fire, and all the idols
@of will I lay desolate: for she ga@d it of the hire of an
harlot, and they @ return to the hire of an harlot.

1:8 @N I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I
will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

1:9 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto @; he is come
unto the gate of my @, even to @ .

1:10 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the @ of
Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

1:11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked:
the inhabitant of Zaanan came not @ in the mourning of Bethezel;
he @ receive of you his standing.

1:12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil
came down from the LORD unto the gate of @ .

1:13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for
the transgressions of @ were @V in thee.

1:14 @N @ thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the @s
of Achzib @ be a lie to the kings of @.

1:15 Yet will I @( an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he
@ come unto Adullam the @Y of @.

1:16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate @; enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

2:1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon @ beds!
when the morning is light, they practise it, @ it is in the
power of @ hand.

2:2 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and @s, and

2:3 @N thus @
 the LORD; @., @
 this family do I
devise an evil, from @ ye @ not remove your necks; @"
@ ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

2:4 In that day @ one take up a parable @
 you, and lament
with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath
changed the portion of my @: how hath he removed it from me!
turning away he hath divided our fields.

2:5 @N thou @ have none that @ cast a cord by lot in
the @` of the LORD.

2:6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they @ not
prophesy to them, that they @ not take shame.

2:7 O thou that art named the @ of @], is the spirit of the
LORD straitened? are @ his doings? do not my @5 do good to him
that walketh up@cly?  2:8 Even of late my @ is risen up as an
enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by
securely as men averse from war.

2:9 The women of my @ have ye cast out from @ pleasant
@s; from @ @ have ye taken away my @Y for ever.

2:10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: @ it is
polluted, it @ destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

2:11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, @, I
will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong @b; he @ even be
the prophet of this @.

2:12 I will surely assemble, O @], all of thee; I will surely
gather the remnant of @; I will put them @? as the sheep of
Bozrah, as the flock in the @a of @ fold: they @ make @
noise by reason of the multitude of men.

2:13 The breaker is come up @	 them: they have broken up, and have
passed @E the gate, and are gone out by it: and @ king @
pass @	 them, and the LORD on the head of them.

3:1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of @], and ye princes of
the @ of @; Is it not for you to know judgment?  3:2 Who hate
the good, and love the evil; who pluck off @ skin from off them,
and @ @R from off @ bones; 3:3 Who also eat the @R of my
@, and flay @ skin from off them; and they break @ bones,
and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as @R within the

3:4 Then @ they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he
will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved
@T ill in @ doings.

3:5 Thus @
 the LORD concerning the prophets that make my @
err, that bite with @ teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth
not into @ @Ps, they even prepare war @
 him.

3:6 @N night @ be unto you, that ye @ not have a

3:7 Then @ the seers be ashamed, and the diviners con@Ved: yea,

3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of

3:9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the @ of @], and princes
of the @ of @, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

3:10 They build up Zion with @I, and @  with iniquity.

3:11 The heads @of judge for reward, and the @6s @of teach
for hire, and the prophets @of divine for money: yet will they
lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD @ us? none evil can
come upon us.

3:12 @N @ Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
@  @ become heaps, and the mountain of the @ as the

4:1 But in the last days it @ come to pass, that the mountain of

4:2 And many nations @ come, and say, Come, and let us go up to

4:3 And he @ judge @ many @, and rebuke strong nations

4:4 But they @ sit @ man @[ his vine and @[ his fig

4:5 For all @ will walk @ one in the name of his god, and we

4:6 In that day, @

I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast

4:8 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of

4:9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is @ no king in thee? is thy

4:10 Be in pain, and labour to @( @, O daughter of Zion, like a

4:11 Now also many nations are ga@d @

4:12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, @" @[stand

4:13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make @ horn

5:1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid

5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little @ the

5:4 And he @ stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the

5:5 And this man @ be the @U, when the Assyrian @ come into

5:6 And they @ waste the land of Assyria with the @Q, and the

5:7 And the remnant of @] @ be in the @a of many @ as a

5:8 And the remnant of @] @ be @ the Gentiles in the @a

5:10 And it @ come to pass in that day, @

6:1 Hear ye now what the LORD @

mountains, and let the hills hear thy @;.

6:2 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong

6:3 O my @, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I

6:4 For I @ thee up out of the land of @-, and redeemed thee

6:5 O my @, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and
what Balaam the son of Beor @> him from Shittim unto Gilgal;
that ye may know the @ceousness of the LORD.

6:6 Wherewith @ I come @	 the LORD, and bow myself @	 the
high God? @ I come @	 him with @_ @&s, with calves of

thy God?  6:9 The LORD's @; crieth unto the city, and the man of
wisdom @ see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

6:10 Are @ yet the treasures of wickedness in the @ of the
wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?  6:11 Shall I count
them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful
weights?  6:12 For the rich men @of are full of violence, and the
inhabitants @of have spoken lies, and @ tongue is deceitful in
@ @P.

6:13 @N also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making

6:14 Thou @ eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down @

6:15 Thou @ sow, but thou @ not reap; thou @ tread the

6:16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the @

7:1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have ga@d the summer fruits,
as the grapegleanings of the vintage: @ is no cluster to eat: my

7:2 The good man is perished out of the @: and @ is none

7:3 That they may do evil with both @D earnestly, the prince

uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

7:4 The best of them is as a brier: the most up@c is sharper than a

7:5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep

7:6 For the son dishonoureth the @, the daughter riseth up
@
 her m@C, the daughter in law @
 her m@C in law; a

7:7 @N I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my

7:8 Rejoice not @

when I sit in darkness, the LORD @ be a light unto me.

7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, @ I have sinned

7:14 Feed thy @ with thy rod, the flock of @ heritage, @

7:15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of @- will

7:16 The nations @ see and be con@Ved at all @ @B: they

7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth

his anger for ever, @ he delighteth in mercy.

7:19 He will turn @*, he will have compassion upon us; he will

Nahum


1:1 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is
furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he
reserveth wrath for his enemies.

1:3 The LORD is slow to anger, and @ in power, and will not at all
acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

1:4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon
languisheth.

1:5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the @ is
burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell @in.

1:6 Who can stand @	 his indignation? and who can abide in the
fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the
rocks are thrown down by him.

1:7 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
knoweth them that trust in him.

1:8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
@' @of, and darkness @ pursue his enemies.

1:9 What do ye imagine @
 the LORD? he will make an utter end:
affliction @ not rise up the second time.

1:10 For while they be folden @? as thorns, and while they are
drunken as drunkards, they @ be devoured as stubble fully dry.

1:11 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil @
 the
LORD, a wicked counsellor.

1:12 Thus @
 the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet
thus @ they be cut down, when he @ pass @E. Though I have
afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

1:13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy
bonds in s@[.

1:14 And the LORD hath @= a commandment concerning thee, that no
more of thy name be sown: out of the @ of thy gods will I cut off
the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou
art vile.

1:15 @. upon the mountains the feet of him that @(eth good
tidings, that publisheth @U! O @, keep thy solemn feasts,
perform thy vows: for the wicked @ no more pass @E thee; he
is utterly cut off.

2:1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up @	 thy face: keep the
munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power
@Bily.

2:2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of @], as the
excellency of @: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and
marred @ vine branches.

2:3 The shield of his @By men is made red, the valiant men are in
scarlet: the chariots @ be with flaming torches in the day of his
preparation, and the fir trees @ be terribly shaken.

2:4 The chariots @ rage in the streets, they @ justle one
@
 @F in the broad ways: they @ seem like torches, they
@ run like the lightnings.

2:5 He @ recount his worthies: they @ stumble in @ walk;
they @ make haste to the wall @of, and the defence @ be

2:6 The gates of the rivers @ be opened, and the palace @ be
dissolved.

2:7 And Huzzab @ be led away captive, she @ be @ up, and
her maids @ lead her as with the @; of doves, tabering upon
@ breasts.

2:8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of @Z: yet they @ flee
away.

Stand, stand, @ they cry; but none @ look back.

2:9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for @ is
none end of the store and @Y out of all the pleasant furniture.

2:10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the @ melteth, and the
knees smite @?, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of
them all gather blackness.

2:11 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding@' of the
young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's
whelp, and none made them afraid?  2:12 The lion did tear in pieces
enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his
holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.

2:13 @., I am @
 thee, @
 the LORD of hosts, and I will
burn her chariots in the smoke, and the @Q @ devour thy young
lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the @, and the @; of
thy messengers @ no more be @).

3:1 Woe to the @Iy city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the
prey departeth not; 3:2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the
rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
chariots.

3:3 The horseman lifteth up both the b@c @Q and the glittering
spear: and @ is a multitude of slain, and a @ number of
carcases; and @ is none end of @ corpses; they stumble upon
@ corpses: 3:4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the
wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
@E her whoredoms, and families @E her witchcrafts.

3:5 @., I am @
 thee, @
 the LORD of hosts; and I will
discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy
nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

3:6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile,
and will set thee as a gazingstock.

3:7 And it @ come to pass, that all they that look upon thee @
flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?
whence @ I seek comforters for thee?  3:8 Art thou better than
populous No, that was situate @ the rivers, that had the @Zs
round @+ it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the
sea?  3:9 Ethiopia and @- were her strength, and it was infinite;
Put and Lubim were thy helpers.

3:10 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
@ also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and
they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her @ men were
bound in chains.

3:11 Thou also @ be drunken: thou @ be hid, thou also @
seek strength @ of the enemy.

3:12 All thy strong holds @ be like fig trees with the @Oripe
figs: if they be shaken, they @ even fall into the @P of the

3:13 @., thy @ in the @a of thee are women: the gates of

3:14 Draw thee @Zs for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into
clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

3:15 There @ the fire devour thee; the @Q @ cut thee off,

cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

3:16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of @1: the
cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

3:17 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the @
grasshoppers, @ camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the
sun ariseth they flee away, and @ @' is not known where they

3:18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles @ dwell
in the dust: thy @ is scattered upon the mountains, and no man
ga@th them.

3:19 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all

Habakkuk


1:1 The burden @ Habakkuk the prophet did see.

1:2 O LORD, how long @ I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out

1:4 @N the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go @:

1:5 @. ye @ the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously:

1:6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,
@ @ march @E the @dth of the land, to possess the

1:7 They are terrible and dreadful: @ judgment and @ dignity

1:8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
fierce than the evening wolves: and @ horsemen @ spread
@T, and @ horsemen @ come from far; they @ fly as

1:9 They @ come all for violence: @ faces @ sup up as the

1:10 And they @ scoff at the kings, and the princes @ be a

1:11 Then @ his mind change, and he @ pass over, and offend,

1:12 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we

@By God, thou hast established them for correction.

1:13 Thou art of purer eyes than to @% evil, and canst not look on
iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,
and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more
@ceous than he?  1:14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as
the creeping @, that have no ruler over them?  1:15 They take up
all of them with the angle, they catch them in @ net, and gather
them in @ drag: @fore they rejoice and are glad.

1:16 @N they sacrifice unto @ net, and burn incense unto

1:17 Shall they @fore empty @ net, and not spare continually

2:2 And the LORD @> me, and said, Write the vision, and make it

2:3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it

hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the
land of Midian did tremble.

3:8 Was the LORD displeased @
 the rivers? was @ anger
@
 the rivers? was thy wrath @
 the sea, that thou didst
ride upon @ horses and thy chariots of salvation?  3:9 Thy bow was
made quite naked, @$ to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word.
Selah. Thou didst cleave the @ with rivers.

3:10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the
@Z passed by: the deep uttered his @;, and lifted up his @D
on high.

3:11 The sun and moon stood still in @ habitation: at the light of
@ arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.

3:12 Thou didst march @E the land in indignation, thou didst
thresh the heathen in anger.

3:13 Thou wentest @ for the salvation of thy @, even for
salvation with @ anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the

Selah.

3:14 Thou didst strike @E with his staves the head of his

was as to devour the poor secretly.

3:15 Thou didst walk @E the sea with @ horses, @E the

3:16 When I @), my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the @;:
rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I
@B rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the @,

3:17 Although the fig tree @ not blossom, @" @ fruit be

3:19 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds'

Zephaniah


1:1 The word of the LORD @ came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi,
the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the
days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of @.

1:2 I will utterly consume all @ from off the land, @
 the
LORD.

1:3 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
@1, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the
wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, @
 the LORD.

1:4 I will also stretch out mine hand upon @, and upon all the
inhabitants of @ ; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from
this @', and the name of the Chemarims with the @6s; 1:5 And
them that worship the host of @1 upon the @tops; and them that
worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; 1:6 And
them that are turned back from the LORD; and @J that have not
sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

1:7 Hold thy @U at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the
LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid
his guests.

1:8 And it @ come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that
I will punish the princes, and the king's @, and all such as
are clothed with strange apparel.

1:9 In the same day also will I punish all @J that leap on the
threshold, @ fill @ masters' @s with violence and deceit.

1:10 And it @ come to pass in that day, @
 the LORD, that @
@ be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from
the second, and a @ crashing from the hills.

1:11 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant @ are
cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

1:12 And it @ come to pass at that time, that I will search
@  with candles, and punish the men that are settled on @

1:13 @N @ goods @ become a booty, and @ @s a

they @ plant vineyards, but not @b the wine @of.

1:14 The @ day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
@ly, even the @; of the day of the LORD: the @By man @
cry @ bitterly.

1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day
of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day
of clouds and thick darkness, 1:16 A day of the trumpet and alarm
@
 the fenced @G, and @
 the high towers.

1:17 And I will @( distress upon men, that they @ walk like
blind men, @ they have sinned @
 the LORD: and @ @I

1:18 Neither @ silver nor @ gold @ be able to deliver them

2:1 Gather yourselves @?, yea, gather @?, O nation not

2:3 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the @, @ have wrought his

2:4 For Gaza @ be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they @

2:5 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
Cherethites! the word of the LORD is @
 you; O Canaan, the land

2:6 And the sea coast @ be dwellings and cottages for shepherds,

2:7 And the coast @ be for the remnant of the @ of @; they

2:8 I have @) the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the

2:9 @N as I live, @
 the LORD of hosts, the God of @,
Surely Moab @ be as Sodom, and the @ of Ammon as Gomorrah,
even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual

2:10 This @ they have for @ pride, @ they have
reproached and magnified @T @
 the @ of the LORD of

2:11 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the

2:12 Ye Ethiopians also, ye @ be slain by my @Q.

2:13 And he will stretch out his hand @

Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a

2:14 And flocks @ lie down in the @a of her, all the beasts of

2:15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
her @, I am, and @ is none beside me: how is she become a
desolation, a @' for beasts to lie down in! @ one that passeth

3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
3:2 She obeyed not the @;; she received not correction; she trusted

3:3 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening
wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

3:4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her @6s have
polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

3:5 The just LORD is in the @a @of; he will not do iniquity:
@ morning doth he @( his judgment to light, he faileth not; but
the unjust knoweth no shame.

3:6 I have cut off the nations: @ towers are desolate; I made
@ streets waste, that none passeth by: @ @G are destroyed,
so that @ is no man, that @ is none inhabitant.

3:7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;

but they rose early, and corrupted all @ doings.

3:8 @N wait ye upon me, @

rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations,
that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation,
even all my fierce anger: for all the @ @ be devoured with the

3:9 For then will I turn to the @ a pure language, that they may

3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the

3:11 In that day @ thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein

3:12 I will also leave in the @a of thee an afflicted and poor

3:14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O @; be glad and rejoice

Haggai


1:1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
@O day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of @, and
to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high @6, @, 1:2 Thus
@Keth the LORD of hosts, @, This @ say, The time is not
come, the time that the LORD's @ @# be built.

1:3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, @, 1:4
Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled @s, and this
@ lie waste?  1:5 Now @fore thus @
 the LORD of hosts;
Consider your ways.

1:6 Ye have sown much, and @( in little; ye eat, but ye have not
enough; ye @b, but ye are not filled with @b; ye clothe you, but
@ is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it
into a bag with holes.

1:7 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

1:8 Go up to the mountain, and @( wood, and build the @; and I
will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, @
 the LORD.

1:9 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye @
it home, I did blow upon it. Why? @
 the LORD of hosts. Because of
mine @ that is waste, and ye run @ man unto his own @.

1:10 @N the @1 over you is stayed from dew, and the @
is stayed from her fruit.

1:11 And I @, for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,
and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon
that @ the ground @(eth @, and upon men, and upon cattle,
and upon all the labour of the @D.

1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high @6, with all the remnant of the @, obeyed
the @; of the LORD @ God, and the @5 of Haggai the prophet,
as the LORD @ God had sent him, and the @ did fear @	 the
LORD.

1:13 Then @0 Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto
the @, @, I am with you, @
 the LORD.

1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of @, and the spirit of Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high @6, and the spirit of all the remnant of the
@; and they came and did work in the @ of the LORD of hosts,
@ God, 1:15 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in
the second year of Darius the king.

2:1 In the @Hth month, in the one and twentieth day of the month,
came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, @, 2:2 Speak now
to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of @, and to Joshua
the son of Josedech, the high @6, and to the residue of the
@, @, 2:3 Who is left @ you that saw this @ in her
@O @Y? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in
comparison of it as no@7?  2:4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,
@
 the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high
@6; and be strong, all ye @ of the land, @
 the LORD, and
work: for I am with you, @
 the LORD of hosts: 2:5 According to the
word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of @-, so my
spirit remaineth @ you: fear ye not.

2:6 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while,
and I will shake the @1s, and the @, and the sea, and the dry
land; 2:7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
@ come: and I will fill this @ with @Y, @
 the LORD of
hosts.

2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, @
 the LORD of hosts.

2:9 The @Y of this latter @ @ be @er than of the
former, @
 the LORD of hosts: and in this @' will I give @U,
@
 the LORD of hosts.

2:10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second
year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,
@, 2:11 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Ask now the @6s
concerning the law, @, 2:12 If one bear holy @R in the skirt
of his garment, and with his skirt do touch @d, or pottage, or
wine, or oil, or any meat, @ it be holy? And the @6s @>
and said, No.

2:13 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
of @, @ it be unclean? And the @6s @> and said, It
@ be unclean.

2:14 Then @> Haggai, and said, So is this @, and so is this
nation @	 me, @
 the LORD; and so is @ work of @ @D;
and that @ they offer @ is unclean.

2:15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
@	 a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: 2:16
Since @J days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures,
@ were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out
fifty vessels out of the press, @ were but twenty.

2:17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
the labours of your @D; yet ye turned not to me, @
 the LORD.

2:18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
@Vation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

2:19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not @ @:
from this day will I bless you.

2:20 And @* the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and
twentieth day of the month, @, 2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor
of @, @, I will shake the @1s and the @; 2:22 And I
will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength
of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and
@J that ride in them; and the horses and @ riders @ come
down, @ one by the @Q of his @X.

2:23 In that day, @
 the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
Zerubbabel, my @<, the son of Shealtiel, @
 the LORD, and will
make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, @
 the LORD of hosts.




Zechariah


1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word
of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the
prophet, @, 1:2 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your
@s.

1:3 @N say thou unto them, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Turn
ye unto me, @
 the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, @

the LORD of hosts.

1:4 Be ye not as your @s, unto whom the former prophets have
cried, @, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your
evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor
hearken unto me, @
 the LORD.

1:5 Your @s, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for
ever?  1:6 But my @5 and my statutes, @ I @M my @<s
the prophets, did they not take hold of your @s? and they
returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us,
@$ to our ways, and @$ to our doings, so hath he dealt
with us.

1:7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, @ is
the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the
LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the
prophet, @, 1:8 I saw by night, and @% a man riding upon a
red horse, and he stood @ the myrtle trees that were in the
bottom; and behind him were @ red horses, speckled, and white.

1:9 Then said I, O my lord, what are @? And the angel that talked
with me said unto me, I will shew thee what @ be.

1:10 And the man that stood @ the myrtle trees @> and said,
These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro @E the
@.

1:11 And they @> the angel of the LORD that stood @ the
myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro @E the @,
and, @%, all the @ sitteth still, and is at rest.

1:12 Then the angel of the LORD @> and said, O LORD of hosts,
how long wilt thou not have mercy on @  and on the @G of
@, @
 @ thou hast had indignation @ @@score and
ten @8?  1:13 And the LORD @> the angel that talked with me
with good @5 and comfortable @5.

1:14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
@, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for @  and
for Zion with a @ jealousy.

1:15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease:
for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the
affliction.

1:16 @N thus @
 the LORD; I am returned to @  with
mercies: my @ @ be built in it, @
 the LORD of hosts, and a
line @ be stretched @ upon @ .

1:17 Cry yet, @, Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; My @G @E
prosperity @ yet be spread abroad; and the LORD @ yet comfort
Zion, and @ yet choose @ .

1:18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and @% four horns.

1:19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be @? And
he @> me, These are the horns @ have scattered @,
@, and @ .

1:20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

1:21 Then said I, What come @ to do? And he @0, @, These
are the horns @ have scattered @, so that no man did lift up
his head: but @ are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of
the Gentiles, @ lifted up @ horn over the land of @ to
scatter it.

2:1 I lifted up mine eyes @*, and looked, and @% a man with a
measuring line in his hand.

2:2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
@ , to see what is the @dth @of, and what is the length
@of.

2:3 And, @%, the angel that talked with me went @, and @F
angel went out to meet him, 2:4 And said unto him, Run, @K to this
young man, @, @  @ be inhabited as towns @S walls
for the multitude of men and cattle @in: 2:5 For I, @
 the

2:6 Ho, ho, come @, and flee from the land of the north, @
 the
LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the @1,
@
 the LORD.

2:7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
Babylon.

2:8 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts; After the @Y hath he sent me
unto the nations @ spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of his eye.

2:9 For, @%, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they @ be a
spoil to @ @<s: and ye @ know that the LORD of hosts hath
sent me.

2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will
dwell in the @a of thee, @
 the LORD.

2:11 And many nations @ be joined to the LORD in that day, and
@ be my @: and I will dwell in the @a of thee, and thou
@ know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

2:12 And the LORD @ inherit @ his portion in the holy land,
and @ choose @  @*.

2:13 Be silent, O all @R, @	 the LORD: for he is raised up out
of his holy habitation.

3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high @6 standing @	 the angel
of the LORD, and Satan standing at his @c hand to resist him.

3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even
the LORD that hath chosen @  rebuke thee: is not this a brand
plucked out of the fire?  3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy
garments, and stood @	 the angel.

3:4 And he @> and @0 unto @J that stood @	 him,
@, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said,
@., I have caused @ iniquity to pass from thee, and I will
clothe thee with change of raiment.

3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a
fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel
of the LORD stood by.

3:6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, @, 3:7 Thus
@
 the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou
wilt keep my charge, then thou @ also judge my @, and @
also keep my courts, and I will give thee @'s to walk @ @

3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high @6, thou, and thy fellows that sit

3:9 For @% the stone that I have laid @	 Joshua; upon one

3:10 In that day, @
 the LORD of hosts, @ ye call @ man his
neighbour @[ the vine and @[ the fig tree.

4:1 And the angel that talked with me came @*, and waked me, as a

4:2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and
@% a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and
his @H lamps @on, and @H pipes to the @H lamps, @ are

4:4 So I @> and @0 to the angel that talked with me, @,
What are @, my lord?  4:5 Then the angel that talked with me

4:6 Then he @> and @0 unto me, @, This is the word of

4:7 Who art thou, O @ mountain? @	 Zerubbabel thou @
become a plain: and he @ @( @ the headstone @of with
shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

4:8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 4:9 The @D
of Zerubbabel have laid the @Vation of this @; his @D @
also finish it; and thou @ know that the LORD of hosts hath sent
me unto you.

4:10 For who hath despised the day of small @? for they @
rejoice, and @ see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with
@J @H; they are the eyes of the LORD, @ run to and fro
@E the whole @.

4:11 Then @> I, and said unto him, What are @ two olive
trees upon the @c side of the candlestick and upon the left side
@of?  4:12 And I @> @*, and said unto him, What be @
two olive branches @ @E the two golden pipes empty the golden
oil out of @T?  4:13 And he @> me and said, Knowest thou
not what @ be? And I said, No, my lord.

4:14 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the
LORD of the whole @.

5:1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and @% a
flying roll.

5:2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I @>, I see a
flying roll; the length @of is twenty cubits, and the @dth
@of ten cubits.

5:3 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth @ over the
face of the whole @: for @ one that stealeth @ be cut off
as on this side @$ to it; and @ one that sweareth @ be
cut off as on that side @$ to it.

5:4 I will @( it @, @
 the LORD of hosts, and it @ enter
into the @ of the thief, and into the @ of him that sweareth
falsely by my name: and it @ remain in the @a of his @, and
@ consume it with the timber @of and the stones @of.

5:5 Then the angel that talked with me went @, and said unto me,
Lift up now @ eyes, and see what is this that goeth @.

5:6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth
@. He said moreover, This is @ resemblance @E all the
@.

5:7 And, @%, @ was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a
woman that sitteth in the @a of the ephah.

5:8 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the @a of
the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the @P @of.

5:9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, @%, @ came
out two women, and the wind was in @ wings; for they had wings
like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the
@ and the @1.

5:10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do @
bear the ephah?  5:11 And he said unto me, To build it an @ in the
land of Shinar: and it @ be established, and set @ upon her
own base.

6:1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, @%,
@ came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the
mountains were mountains of brass.

6:2 In the @O chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot
black horses; 6:3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the
fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.

6:4 Then I @> and said unto the angel that talked with me, What
are @, my lord?  6:5 And the angel @> and said unto me,
These are the four spirits of the @1s, @ go @ from
standing @	 the LORD of all the @.

6:6 The black horses @ are @in go @ into the north
country; and the white go @ @ them; and the grisled go @
toward the south country.

6:7 And the bay went @, and sought to go that they @B walk to
and fro @E the @: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro
@E the @. So they walked to and fro @E the @.

6:8 Then cried he upon me, and @0 unto me, @, @., @
that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north
country.

6:9 And the word of the LORD came unto me, @, 6:10 Take of them
of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, @
are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the
@ of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 6:11 Then take silver and gold,
and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high @6; 6:12 And @K unto him, @, Thus
@Keth the LORD of hosts, @, @. the man whose name is The
BRANCH; and he @ grow up out of his @', and he @ build the
temple of the LORD: 6:13 Even he @ build the temple of the LORD;
and he @ bear the @Y, and @ sit and rule upon his throne;
and he @ be a @6 upon his throne: and the counsel of @U
@ be between them both.

6:14 And the crowns @ be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,
and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the
LORD.

6:15 And they that are far off @ come and build in the temple of
the LORD, and ye @ know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto
you. And this @ come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the @;
of the LORD your God.

7:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the
word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth
month, even in Chisleu; 7:2 When they had sent unto the @ of God
Sherezer and Regemmelech, and @ men, to pray @	 the LORD, 7:3
And to @K unto the @6s @ were in the @ of the LORD of
hosts, and to the prophets, @, Should I weep in the fifth month,
separating myself, as I have done @ so many @8?  7:4 Then came
the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, @, 7:5 Speak unto all the
@ of the land, and to the @6s, @, When ye fasted and
mourned in the fifth and @Hth month, even @J @Hty @8, did
ye at all fast unto me, even to me?  7:6 And when ye did eat, and when
ye did @b, did not ye eat for yourselves, and @b for yourselves?
7:7 Should ye not hear the @5 @ the LORD hath cried by the
former prophets, when @  was inhabited and in prosperity, and
the @G @of round @+ her, when men inhabited the south and
the plain?  7:8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, @,
7:9 Thus @Keth the LORD of hosts, @, Execute true judgment,
and shew mercy and compassions @ man to his @X: 7:10 And
oppress not the widow, nor the @less, the stranger, nor the poor;
and let none of you imagine evil @
 his @X in your @.

7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the @#er, and
stopped @ ears, that they @# not hear.

7:12 Yea, they made @ @s as an adamant stone, lest they @#
hear the law, and the @5 @ the LORD of hosts hath sent in his
spirit by the former prophets: @fore came a @ wrath from the
LORD of hosts.

7:13 @N it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they @L
not hear; so they cried, and I @L not hear, @
 the LORD of
hosts: 7:14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind @ all the
nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate @ them,
that no man passed @E nor returned: for they laid the pleasant
land desolate.

8:1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, @, 8:2 Thus
@
 the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with @ jealousy,
and I was jealous for her with @ fury.

8:3 Thus @
 the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in
the @a of @ : and @  @ be @, a city of truth;
and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.

8:4 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; There @ yet old men and old
women dwell in the streets of @ , and @ man with his staff
in his hand for very age.

8:5 And the streets of the city @ be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets @of.

8:6 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of
the remnant of this @ in @ days, @# it also be marvellous
in mine eyes? @
 the LORD of hosts.

8:7 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; @., I will save my @ from
the east country, and from the west country; 8:8 And I will @(
them, and they @ dwell in the @a of @ : and they @
be my @, and I will be @ God, in truth and in @ceousness.

8:9 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; Let your @D be strong, ye that
hear in @ days @ @5 by the @P of the prophets, @
were in the day that the @Vation of the @ of the LORD of hosts
was laid, that the temple @B be built.

8:10 For @	 @ days @ was no hire for man, nor any hire for
beast; @" was @ any @U to him that went out or came in
@ of the affliction: for I set all men @ one @
 his
neighbour.

8:11 But now I will not be unto the residue of this @ as in the
former days, @
 the LORD of hosts.

8:12 For the seed @ be prosperous; the vine @ give her fruit,
and the ground @ give her increase, and the @1s @ give
@ dew; and I will cause the remnant of this @ to possess all
@ @.

8:13 And it @ come to pass, that as ye were a curse @ the
heathen, O @ of @, and @ of @; so will I save you,
and ye @ be a blessing: fear not, but let your @D be strong.

8:14 For thus @
 the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
when your @s provoked me to wrath, @
 the LORD of hosts, and I
repented not: 8:15 So @* have I thought in @ days to do well
unto @  and to the @ of @: fear ye not.

8:16 These are the @ that ye @ do; Speak ye @ man the
truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and @U in
your gates: 8:17 And let none of you imagine evil in your @s
@
 his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all @ are
@ that I hate, @
 the LORD.

8:18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, @, 8:19 Thus
@
 the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of
the fifth, and the fast of the @Hth, and the fast of the tenth,
@ be to the @ of @ joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;
@fore love the truth and @U.

8:20 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; It @ yet come to pass, that
@ @ come @, and the inhabitants of many @G: 8:21 And
the inhabitants of one city @ go to @F, @, Let us go
speedily to pray @	 the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I
will go also.

8:22 Yea, many @ and strong nations @ come to seek the LORD
of hosts in @ , and to pray @	 the LORD.

8:23 Thus @
 the LORD of hosts; In @J days it @ come to
pass, that ten men @ take hold out of all languages of the
nations, even @ take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,
@, We will go with you: for we have @) that God is with you.

9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
Damascus @ be the rest @of: when the eyes of man, as of all
the tribes of @, @ be toward the LORD.

9:2 And Hamath also @ border @by; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it
be very wise.

9:3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as
the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

9:4 @., the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in
the sea; and she @ be devoured with fire.

9:5 Ashkelon @ see it, and fear; Gaza also @ see it, and be
very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation @ be ashamed; and
the king @ perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon @ not be inhabited.

9:6 And a bastard @ dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride
of the Philistines.

9:7 And I will take away his @I out of his @P, and his
abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he,
@ be for our God, and he @ be as a governor in @, and
Ekron as a Jebusite.

9:8 And I will encamp @+ mine @ @ of the army, @ of
him that passeth by, and @ of him that returneth: and no
oppressor @ pass @E them any more: for now have I seen with
mine eyes.

9:9 Rejoice @ly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
@ : @%, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having
salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of
an ass.

9:10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
@ , and the battle bow @ be cut off: and he @ @K
@U unto the heathen: and his dominion @ be from sea even to
sea, and from the river even to the ends of the @.

9:11 As for thee also, by the @I of thy covenant I have sent @
thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no @Z.

9:12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do
I declare that I will render double unto thee; 9:13 When I have bent
@ for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O
Zion, @
 thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the @Q of a
@By man.

9:14 And the LORD @ be seen over them, and his arrow @ go
@ as the lightning: and the LORD God @ blow the trumpet, and
@ go with whirlwinds of the south.

9:15 The LORD of hosts @ defend them; and they @ devour, and
subdue with sling stones; and they @ @b, and make a noise as
@E wine; and they @ be filled like bowls, and as the corners
of the @\.

9:16 And the LORD @ God @ save them in that day as the flock
of his @: for they @ be as the stones of a crown, lifted up
as an ensign upon his land.

9:17 For how @ is his goodness, and how @ is his beauty! corn
@ make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

10:1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
LORD @ make b@c clouds, and give them showers of rain, to @
one grass in the field.

10:2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: @fore they
went @ way as a flock, they were troubled, @ @ was no
shepherd.

10:3 Mine anger was kindled @
 the shepherds, and I punished the
goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the @ of
@, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.

10:4 Out of him came @ the corner, out of him the nail, out of him
the battle bow, out of him @ oppressor @?.

10:5 And they @ be as @By men, @ tread down @ enemies
in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they @ fight,
@ the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses @ be
con@Ved.

10:6 And I will strengthen the @ of @, and I will save the
@ of Joseph, and I will @( them @* to @' them; for I have
mercy upon them: and they @ be as though I had not cast them off:
for I am the LORD @ God, and will hear them.

10:7 And they of Ephraim @ be like a @By man, and @ @
@ rejoice as @E wine: yea, @ @ @ see it, and
be glad; @ @ @ rejoice in the LORD.

10:8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them:
and they @ increase as they have increased.

10:9 And I will sow them @ the @: and they @ remember me
in far countries; and they @ live with @ @, and turn
@*.

10:10 I will @( them @* also out of the land of @-, and
gather them out of Assyria; and I will @( them into the land of
Gilead and Lebanon; and @' @ not be @V for them.

10:11 And he @ pass @E the sea with affliction, and @
smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river @ dry
up: and the pride of Assyria @ be @ down, and the sceptre of
@- @ depart away.

10:12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they @ walk up
and down in his name, @
 the LORD.

11:1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

11:2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; @ the @By are
spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is
come down.

11:3 There is a @; of the howling of the shepherds; for @ @Y
is spoiled: a @; of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of
Jordan is spoiled.

11:4 Thus @
 the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5
Whose possessors slay them, and hold @T not guilty: and they
that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and @ own
shepherds pity them not.

11:6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, @
 the
LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men @ one into his neighbour's
hand, and into the hand of his king: and they @ smite the land,
and out of @ hand I will not deliver them.

11:7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the
flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I @, Beauty, and the
@C I @, Bands; and I fed the flock.

11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed
them, and @ soul also abhorred me.

11:9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest
eat @ one the @R of @F.

11:10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it as@[, that I
@B break my covenant @ I had made with all the @.

11:11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that
waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

11:12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if
not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.

11:13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of
silver, and cast them to the potter in the @ of the LORD.

11:14 Then I cut as@[ mine @C staff, even Bands, that I @B
break the @Xhood between @ and @.

11:15 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of
a foolish shepherd.

11:16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, @ @ not
visit @J that be cut off, @" @ seek the young one, nor
heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he
@ eat the @R of the fat, and tear @ claws in pieces.

11:17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the @Q @
be upon his arm, and upon his @c eye: his arm @ be clean dried
up, and his @c eye @ be utterly darkened.

12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD for @, @
 the LORD,
@ stretcheth @ the @1s, and layeth the @Vation of the
@, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

12:2 @., I will make @  a cup of trembling unto all the
@ round @+, when they @ be in the siege both @
 @
and @
 @ .

12:3 And in that day will I make @  a burdensome stone for all
@: all that burden @T with it @ be cut in pieces,
though all the @ of the @ be ga@d @? @
 it.

12:4 In that day, @
 the LORD, I will smite @ horse with
astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes
upon the @ of @, and will smite @ horse of the @ with
blindness.

12:5 And the governors of @ @ say in @ @, The
inhabitants of @  @ be my strength in the LORD of hosts
@ God.

12:6 In that day will I make the governors of @ like an @h of
fire @ the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they
@ devour all the @ round @+, on the @c hand and on the
left: and @  @ be inhabited @* in her own @', even in

12:7 The LORD also @ save the tents of @ @O, that the @Y
of the @ of @ and the @Y of the inhabitants of @  do
not magnify @T @
 @.

12:8 In that day @ the LORD defend the inhabitants of @ ;
and he that is feeble @ them at that day @ be as @; and
the @ of @ @ be as God, as the angel of the LORD @	
them.

12:9 And it @ come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
destroy all the nations that come @
 @ .

12:10 And I will pour upon the @ of @, and upon the
inhabitants of @ , the spirit of grace and of supplications:
and they @ look upon me whom they have pierced, and they @
mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and @ be in
bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his @Oborn.

12:11 In that day @ @ be a @ mourning in @ , as the
mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

12:12 And the land @ mourn, @ family apart; the family of the
@ of @ apart, and @ wives apart; the family of the @
of Nathan apart, and @ wives apart; 12:13 The family of the @
of Levi apart, and @ wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and
@ wives apart; 12:14 All the families that remain, @ family
apart, and @ wives apart.

13:1 In that day @ @ be a fountain opened to the @ of
@ and to the inhabitants of @  for sin and for uncleanness.

13:2 And it @ come to pass in that day, @
 the LORD of hosts,
that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they
@ no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and
the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

13:3 And it @ come to pass, that when any @ yet prophesy, then
his @ and his m@C that begat him @ say unto him, Thou
@ not live; for thou @Kest lies in the name of the LORD: and
his @ and his m@C that begat him @ thrust him @E when
he prophesieth.

13:4 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the prophets @ be
ashamed @ one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; @"
@ they wear a rough garment to deceive: 13:5 But he @ say, I
am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle
from my youth.

13:6 And one @ say unto him, What are @ wounds in @ @D?
Then he @ answer, Those with @ I was wounded in the @ of
my friends.

13:7 Awake, O @Q, @
 my shepherd, and @
 the man that is
my fellow, @
 the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep
@ be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

13:8 And it @ come to pass, that in all the land, @
 the LORD,
two parts @in @ be cut off and die; but the third @ be
left @in.

13:9 And I will @( the third part @E the fire, and will refine
them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they
@ call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my
@: and they @ say, The LORD is my God.

14:1 @., the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil @ be
divided in the @a of thee.

14:2 For I will gather all nations @
 @  to battle; and
the city @ be taken, and the @s rifled, and the women
ravished; and half of the city @ go @ into captivity, and the
residue of the @ @ not be cut off from the city.

14:3 Then @ the LORD go @, and fight @
 @J nations, as
when he fought in the day of battle.

14:4 And his feet @ stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
@ is @	 @  on the east, and the mount of Olives @
cleave in the @a @of toward the east and toward the west, and
@ @ be a very @ valley; and half of the mountain @
remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

14:5 And ye @ flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley
of the mountains @ reach unto Azal: yea, ye @ flee, like as ye
fled from @	 the @quake in the days of Uzziah king of @:
and the LORD my God @ come, and all the saints with thee.

14:6 And it @ come to pass in that day, that the light @ not
be clear, nor dark: 14:7 But it @ be one day @ @ be known
to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it @ come to pass, that at
evening time it @ be light.

14:8 And it @ be in that day, that living @Zs @ go out from
@ ; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward

14:13 And it @ come to pass in that day, that a @ tumult from

14:16 And it @ come to pass, that @ one that is left of all

1:1 The burden of the word of the LORD to @ by Malachi.

1:2 I have loved you, @
 the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
loved us? Was not Esau @]'s @X? @
 the LORD: yet I loved
@], 1:3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

1:4 Whereas Edom @

 the LORD of hosts, They @

1:5 And your eyes @ see, and ye @ say, The LORD will be
magnified from the border of @.

1:6 A son honoureth his @, and a @< his master: if then I be
a @, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my

 the LORD of hosts unto you, O @6s, that despise my
name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  1:7 Ye offer
polluted @d upon mine @\; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted
thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.

1:8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye
offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy
governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? @

the LORD of hosts.

1:9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:
this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? @
 the
LORD of hosts.

1:10 Who is @ even @ you that @L shut the doors for nought?
@" do ye kindle fire on mine @\ for nought. I have no pleasure

1:12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is
polluted; and the fruit @of, even his meat, is contemptible.

1:13 Ye said also, @., what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed

 the LORD of hosts; and ye @ that @ was torn,

1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, @ hath in his flock a male, and
voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt @7: for I am a

2:1 And now, O ye @6s, this commandment is for you.

2:2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to @, to give
@Y unto my name, @
 the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse

already, @ ye do not lay it to @.

2:3 @., I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one @ take you away with
it.

2:4 And ye @ know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that
my covenant @B be with Levi, @
 the LORD of hosts.

2:5 My covenant was with him of life and @U; and I gave them to him
for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid @	 my name.

2:6 The law of truth was in his @P, and iniquity was not @V in
his lips: he walked with me in @U and equity, and did turn many
away from iniquity.

2:7 For the @6's lips @# keep knowledge, and they @# seek
the law at his @P: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

2:8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble
at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, @
 the LORD of
hosts.

2:9 @N have I also made you contemptible and base @	 all
the @, @$ as ye have not kept my ways, but have been
partial in the law.

2:10 Have we not all one @? hath not one God created us? why do
we deal treacherously @ man @
 his @X, by profaning the
covenant of our @s?  2:11 @ hath dealt treacherously, and an
abomination is committed in @ and in @ ; for @ hath
profaned the holiness of the LORD @ he loved, and hath married the
daughter of a strange god.

2:12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
scholar, out of the tabernacles of @], and him that offereth an
@& unto the LORD of hosts.

2:13 And this have ye done @*, covering the @\ of the LORD with
tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth
not the @& any more, or receiveth it with good will at your
hand.

2:14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between
thee and the wife of thy youth, @
 whom thou hast dealt
treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.

2:15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
And wherefore one? That he @B seek a godly seed. @N take
heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously @
 the wife

2:16 For the LORD, the God of @, @
 that he hateth putting

 the LORD of
hosts: @fore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not
treacherously.

2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your @5. Yet ye say, Wherein
have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in
the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God
of judgment?  3:1 @., I will send my messenger, and he @
prepare the way @	 me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, @ suddenly

delight in: @%, he @ come, @

3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who @ stand when

3:3 And he @ sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he @
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
may offer unto the LORD an @& in @ceousness.

3:4 Then @ the @& of @ and @  be pleasant unto
the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former @8.

3:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
witness @
 the sorcerers, and @
 the adulterers, and @

false swearers, and @
 @J that oppress the hireling in his
wages, the widow, and the @less, and that turn aside the stranger
from his @c, and fear not me, @
 the LORD of hosts.

3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; @fore ye sons of @] are
not consumed.

3:7 Even from the days of your @s ye are gone away from mine
ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return
unto you, @
 the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein @ we
return?  3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,
Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and @&s.

3:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole
nation.

3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the store@, that @ may be
meat in mine @, and prove me now herewith, @
 the LORD of
hosts, if I will not open you the windows of @1, and pour you out
a blessing, that @ @ not be room enough to receive it.

3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he @ not
destroy the fruits of your ground; @" @ your vine cast her
fruit @	 the time in the field, @
 the LORD of hosts.

3:12 And all nations @ call you blessed: for ye @ be a
delightsome land, @
 the LORD of hosts.

3:13 Your @5 have been stout @
 me, @
 the LORD. Yet ye
say, What have we spoken so much @
 thee?  3:14 Ye have said, It
is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his
ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully @	 the LORD of
hosts?  3:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.

3:16 Then they that feared the LORD @0 often one to @F: and
the LORD hearkened, and @) it, and a book of remembrance was
written @	 him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought
upon his name.

3:17 And they @ be mine, @

I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own

3:18 Then @ ye return, and discern between the @ceous and the

4:1 For, @%, the day cometh, that @ burn as an oven; and all

4:3 And ye @ tread down the wicked; for they @ be ashes @[

The Gospel According to Saint Matthew


1:1 The book of the generation of @ @2, the son of @, the
son of Abraham.

1:2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat @]; and @] begat Judas
and his @3; 1:3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and
Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 1:4 And Aram begat Aminadab;
and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 1:5 And Salmon
begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat
Jesse; 1:6 And Jesse begat @ the king; and @ the king begat
Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 1:7 And Solomon begat
Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 1:8 And Asa begat
Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 1:9 And
Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
1:10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
begat Josias; 1:11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his @3, @+
the time they were carried away to Babylon: 1:12 And @ they were
@ to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat

Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 1:15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and
Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat @]; 1:16 And @] begat
Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born @, who is @,
@2.

1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to @ are fourteen
generations; and from @ until the carrying away into Babylon are
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto
@2 are fourteen generations.

1:18 Now the birth of @ @2 was on this wise: When as his
m@C Mary was espoused to Joseph, @	 they came @?, she was
@V with child of the Holy Ghost.

1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

1:20 But while he thought on @ @, @%, the angel of the
LORD appeared unto him in a dream, @, Joseph, thou son of @,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that @ is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost.

1:21 And she @ @( @ a son, and thou @ call his name
JESUS: for he @ save his @ from @ sins.

1:22 Now all this was done, that it @B be fulfilled @ was
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, @, 1:23 @., a virgin @
be with child, and @ @( @ a son, and they @ call his
name Emmanuel, @ being interpreted is, God with us.

1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 1:25 And knew her not till
she had @ @ her @Oborn son: and he @, his name JESUS.

2:1 Now when @ was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king, @%, @ came wise men from the east to
@ , 2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for
we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

2:3 When Herod the king had @) @ @, he was troubled, and
all @  with him.

2:4 And when he had ga@d all the chief @6s and scribes of the
@ @?, he demanded of them where @2 @# be born.

2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
written by the prophet, 2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda,
art not the least @ the princes of Juda: for out of thee @
come a Governor, that @ rule my @ @.

2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily @, the wise men, enquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared.

2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when ye have @V him, @( me word @*,
that I may come and worship him also.

2:9 When they had @) the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
@ they saw in the east, went @	 them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was.

2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding @ joy.

2:11 And when they were come into the @, they saw the young child
with Mary his m@C, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they
had opened @ treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense and myrrh.

2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they @# not return to
Herod, they departed into @ own country @F way.

2:13 And when they were departed, @%, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, @, Arise, and take the young
child and his m@C, and flee into @-, and be thou @ until I
@( thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his m@C by night,
and departed into @-: 2:15 And was @ until the @^ of Herod:
that it @B be fulfilled @ was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, @, Out of @- have I @, my son.

2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
exceeding wroth, and sent @, and slew all the @ that were
in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts @of, from two @8 old and
@[, @$ to the time @ he had diligently enquired of the
wise men.

2:17 Then was fulfilled that @ was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
@, 2:18 In Rama was @ a @; @), lamentation, and
weeping, and @ mourning, Rachel weeping for her @, and
@L not be comforted, @ they are not.

2:19 But when Herod was dead, @%, an angel of the Lord appeareth
in a dream to Joseph in @-, 2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his m@C, and go into the land of @: for they are
dead @ sought the young child's life.

2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his m@C, and came
into the land of @.

2:22 But when he @) that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
of his @ Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,
being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of
Galilee: 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city @, Nazareth: that it
@B be fulfilled @ was spoken by the prophets, He @ be
@, a Nazarene.

3:1 In @J days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
of Judaea, 3:2 And @, Repent ye: for the kingdom of @1 is at
hand.

3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, @,
The @; of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.

3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern
girdle @+ his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

3:5 Then went out to him @ , and all Judaea, and all the region
round @+ Jordan, 3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
@ sins.

3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?  3:8 Bring @ @fore fruits
meet for repentance: 3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We
have Abraham to our @: for I say unto you, that God is able of
@ stones to raise up @ unto Abraham.

3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
@fore @ tree @ @(eth not @ good fruit is hewn down,
and cast into the fire.

3:11 I indeed baptize you with @Z unto repentance. but he that
cometh @ me is @Bier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
bear: he @ baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 3:12
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will @Ely purge his floor, and
gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire.

3:13 Then cometh @ from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
baptized of him.

3:14 But John forbad him, @, I have need to be baptized of thee,
and comest thou to me?  3:15 And @ answering said unto him, Suffer
it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all @ceousness.
Then he suffered him.

3:16 And @, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
@Z: and, lo, the @1s were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 3:17 And
lo a @; from @1, @, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.

4:1 Then was @ led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted of the devil.

4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
@ward an hungred.

4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of
God, command that @ stones be made @d.

4:4 But he @> and said, It is written, Man @ not live by
@d alone, but by @ word that proceedeth out of the @P of
God.

4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him
on a pinnacle of the temple, 4:6 And @
 unto him, If thou be the
Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He @ give his
angels charge concerning thee: and in @ @D they @ bear thee
up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot @
 a stone.

4:7 @ said unto him, It is written @*, Thou @ not tempt the
Lord thy God.

4:8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,
and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the @Y of them;
4:9 And @
 unto him, All @ @ will I give thee, if thou
wilt fall down and worship me.

4:10 Then @
 @ unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
written, Thou @ worship the Lord thy God, and him only @ thou
serve.

4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, @%, angels came and
ministered unto him.

4:12 Now when @ had @) that John was cast into prison, he
departed into Galilee; 4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in
Capernaum, @ is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and
Nephthalim: 4:14 That it @B be fulfilled @ was spoken by Esaias
the prophet, @, 4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of
Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the
Gentiles; 4:16 The @ @ sat in darkness saw @ light; and
to them @ sat in the region and shadow of @^ light is sprung
up.

4:17 From that time @ began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
kingdom of @1 is at hand.

4:18 And @, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two @3, Simon
@, Peter, and Andrew his @X, casting a net into the sea: for
they were fishers.

4:19 And he @
 unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
men.

4:20 And they straightway left @ nets, and followed him.

4:21 And going on from thence, he saw @C two @3, James the
son of Zebedee, and John his @X, in a ship with Zebedee @
@, mending @ nets; and he @, them.

4:22 And they immediately left the ship and @ @, and followed
him.

4:23 And @ went @+ all Galilee, teaching in @ synagogues,
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of
sickness and all manner of disease @ the @.

4:24 And his fame went @Eout all Syria: and they @ unto him
all sick @ that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and
@J @ were possessed with devils, and @J @ were lunatick,
and @J that had the palsy; and he healed them.

4:25 And @ followed him @ multitudes of @ from Galilee,
and from Decapolis, and from @ , and from Judaea, and from
beyond Jordan.

5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he
was set, his disciples came unto him: 5:2 And he opened his @P, and
taught them, @, 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for @s is

5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they @ be comforted.

5:11 Blessed are ye, when men @ revile you, and persecute you, and
@ say all manner of evil @
 you falsely, for my sake.

5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for @ is your reward in
@1: for so persecuted they the prophets @ were @	 you.

5:13 Ye are the salt of the @: but if the salt have lost his
savour, wherewith @ it be salted? it is thence@ good for
no@7, but to be cast out, and to be trodden @[ foot of men.

5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid.

5:15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it @[ a bushel, but on
a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the @.

5:16 Let your light so shine @	 men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father @ is in @1.

5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till @1 and @ pass, one jot or
one tittle @ in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

5:19 Whosoever @fore @ break one of @ least commandments,
and @ teach men so, he @ be @, the least in the kingdom of
@1: but whosoever @ do and teach them, the same @ be
@, @ in the kingdom of @1.

5:20 For I say unto you, That except your @ceousness @ exceed
the @ceousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye @ in no case
enter into the kingdom of @1.

5:21 Ye have @) that it was said by them of old time, Thou @
not kill; and whosoever @ kill @ be in danger of the judgment:
5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his @X
@S a cause @ be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever
@ say to his @X, Raca, @ be in danger of the council: but
whosoever @ say, Thou fool, @ be in danger of hell fire.

5:23 @N if thou @( thy gift to the @\, and @
rememberest that thy @X hath ought @
 thee; 5:24 Leave @
thy gift @	 the @\, and go thy way; @O be reconciled to thy
@X, and then come and offer thy gift.

5:25 Agree with @ adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,
and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
prison.

5:26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou @ by no means come out thence,
till thou hast paid the uttermost far@7.

5:27 Ye have @) that it was said by them of old time, Thou @
not commit adultery: 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh
on a woman to lust @ her hath committed adultery with her already
in his @.

5:29 And if thy @c eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members @#
perish, and not that thy whole body @# be cast into hell.

5:30 And if thy @c hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from
thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members @#
perish, and not that thy whole body @# be cast into hell.

5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever @ put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of divorcement: 5:32 But I say unto you, That
whosoever @ put away his wife, saving for the cause of
fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever @ marry
her that is divorced committeth adultery.

5:33 Again, ye have @) that it hath been said by them of old time,
Thou @ not forswear thyself, but @ perform unto the Lord @
oaths: 5:34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; @" by @1;
for it is God's throne: 5:35 Nor by the @; for it is his
footstool: @" by @ ; for it is the city of the @ King.

5:36 Neither @ thou swear by thy head, @ thou canst not make
one hair white or black.

5:37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever
is more than @ cometh of evil.

5:38 Ye have @) that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth: 5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:
but whosoever @ smite thee on thy @c cheek, turn to him the
@C also.

5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak also.

5:41 And whosoever @ compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that @L borrow of
thee turn not thou away.

5:43 Ye have @) that it hath been said, Thou @ love thy
neighbour, and hate @ enemy.

5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them @ despitefully
use you, and persecute you; 5:45 That ye may be the @ of your
Father @ is in @1: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

5:46 For if ye love them @ love you, what reward have ye? do not
even the publicans the same?  5:47 And if ye salute your @3
only, what do ye more than @Cs? do not even the publicans so?  5:48
Be ye @fore perfect, even as your Father @ is in @1 is
perfect.

6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms @	 men, to be seen of them:
@Cwise ye have no reward of your Father @ is in @1.

6:2 @N when thou doest @ alms, do not sound a trumpet
@	 thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets, that they may have @Y of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have @ reward.

6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
@c hand doeth: 6:4 That @ alms may be in secret: and thy Father
@ seeth in secret @9 @ reward thee openly.

6:5 And when thou prayest, thou @ not be as the hypocrites are:
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of
the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have @ reward.

6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father @ is in secret; and thy
Father @ seeth in secret @ reward thee openly.

6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
they think that they @ be @) for @ much @King.

6:8 Be not ye @fore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
@ ye have need of, @	 ye ask him.

6:9 After this manner @fore pray ye: Our Father @ art in
@1, Hallowed be thy name.

6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in @, as it is in @1.

6:11 Give us this day our daily @d.

6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
@ is the kingdom, and the power, and the @Y, for ever. Amen.

6:14 For if ye forgive men @ trespasses, your @1ly Father will
also forgive you: 6:15 But if ye forgive not men @ trespasses,
@" will your Father forgive your trespasses.

6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
countenance: for they disfigure @ faces, that they may appear unto
men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have @ reward.

6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint @ head, and wash thy
face; 6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
@ is in secret: and thy Father, @ seeth in secret, @
reward thee openly.

6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon @, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break @E and steal: 6:20 But
lay up for yourselves treasures in @1, where @" moth nor rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break @E nor steal: 6:21
For where your treasure is, @ will your @ be also.

6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if @fore @ eye be
single, thy whole body @ be full of light.

6:23 But if @ eye be evil, thy whole body @ be full of
darkness.

If @fore the light that is in thee be darkness, how @ is that
darkness!  6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate
the one, and love the @C; or else he will hold to the one, and
despise the @C. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

6:25 @N I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
@ eat, or what ye @ @b; nor yet for your body, what ye
@ put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
raiment?  6:26 @. the fowls of the air: for they sow not, @"
do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your @1ly Father feedeth
them. Are ye not much better than they?  6:27 Which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  6:28 And why take ye
thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
they toil not, @" do they spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That
even Solomon in all his @Y was not arrayed like one of @.

6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, @ to day
is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, @ he not much more clothe
you, O ye of little faith?  6:31 @N take no thought, @,
What @ we eat? or, What @ we @b? or, Wherewithal @ we
be clothed?  6:32 (For @ all @ @ do the Gentiles seek:)
for your @1ly Father knoweth that ye have need of all @
@.

6:33 But seek ye @O the kingdom of God, and his @ceousness; and
all @ @ @ be added unto you.

6:34 Take @fore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow @
take thought for the @ of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil @of.

7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

7:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye @ be judged: and with what
measure ye mete, it @ be measured to you @*.

7:3 And why @%est thou the mote that is in thy @X's eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in @ own eye?  7:4 Or how wilt
thou say to thy @X, Let me pull out the mote out of @ eye;
and, @%, a beam is in @ own eye?  7:5 Thou hypocrite, @O
cast out the beam out of @ own eye; and then @ thou see
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy @X's eye.

7:6 Give not that @ is holy unto the dogs, @" cast ye your
pearls @	 swine, lest they trample them @[ @ feet, and turn
@* and rend you.

7:7 Ask, and it @ be @= you; seek, and ye @ find; knock,
and it @ be opened unto you: 7:8 For @ one that asketh
receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it
@ be opened.

7:9 Or what man is @ of you, whom if his son ask @d, will he
give him a stone?  7:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent?  7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your @, how much more @ your Father @ is in @1
give good @ to them that ask him?  7:12 @N all @
whatsoever ye @L that men @# do to you, do ye even so to them:
for this is the law and the prophets.

7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many @ be @ go in
@at: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, @
leadeth unto life, and few @ be that find it.

7:15 Beware of false prophets, @ come to you in sheep's clo@7,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

7:16 Ye @ know them by @ fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?  7:17 Even so @ good tree @(eth
@ good fruit; but a corrupt tree @(eth @ evil fruit.

7:18 A good tree cannot @( @ evil fruit, @" can a corrupt
tree @( @ good fruit.

7:19 Every tree that @(eth not @ good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

7:20 Wherefore by @ fruits ye @ know them.

7:21 Not @ one that @
 unto me, Lord, Lord, @ enter into
the kingdom of @1; but he that doeth the will of my Father @
is in @1.

7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in
thy name done many wonderful works?  7:23 And then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

7:24 @N whosoever heareth @ @s of mine, and doeth
them, I will liken him unto a wise man, @ built his @ upon a
rock: 7:25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that @; and it fell not: for it was @Ved
upon a rock.

7:26 And @ one that heareth @ @s of mine, and doeth them
not, @ be likened unto a foolish man, @ built his @ upon
the sand: 7:27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew, and beat upon that @; and it fell: and @ was the
fall of it.

7:28 And it came to pass, when @ had ended @ @s, the
@ were astonished at his doctrine: 7:29 For he taught them as one
having authority, and not as the scribes.

8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, @ multitudes followed
him.

8:2 And, @%, @ came a leper and worshipped him, @, Lord,
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

8:3 And @ put @ his hand, and touched him, @, I will; be
thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

8:4 And @ @
 unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,
shew thyself to the @6, and offer the gift that @ @M,
for a testimony unto them.

8:5 And when @ was entered into Capernaum, @ came unto him a
centurion, beseeching him, 8:6 And @, Lord, my @< lieth at
home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

8:7 And @ @
 unto him, I will come and heal him.

8:8 The centurion @> and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
@#est come @[ my roof: but @K the word only, and my @<
@ be healed.

8:9 For I am a man @[ authority, having soldiers @[ me: and I
say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to @F, Come, and he
cometh; and to my @<, Do this, and he doeth it.

8:10 When @ @) it, he marvelled, and said to them that
followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not @V so @ faith, no,
not in @.

8:11 And I say unto you, That many @ come from the east and west,
and @ sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and @], in the kingdom
of @1.

8:12 But the @ of the kingdom @ be cast out into outer
darkness: @ @ be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

8:13 And @ said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his @< was healed in the
selfsame hour.

8:14 And when @ was come into Peter's @, he saw his wife's
m@C laid, and sick of a fever.

8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,
and ministered unto them.

8:16 When the even was come, they @ unto him many that were
possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and
healed all that were sick: 8:17 That it @B be fulfilled @ was
spoken by Esaias the prophet, @, Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses.

8:18 Now when @ saw @ multitudes @+ him, he gave
commandment to depart unto the @C side.

8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

8:20 And @ @
 unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

8:21 And @F of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me @O
to go and bury my @.

8:22 But @ said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury @
dead.

8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.

8:24 And, @%, @ arose a @ tempest in the sea, insomuch
that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, @, Lord, save
us: we perish.

8:26 And he @
 unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and @ was a
@ calm.

8:27 But the men marvelled, @, What manner of man is this, that
even the winds and the sea obey him!  8:28 And when he was come to the
@C side into the country of the Gergesenes, @ met him two
possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so
that no man @B pass by that way.

8:29 And, @%, they cried out, @, What have we to do with
thee, @, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us
@	 the time?  8:30 And @ was a good way off from them an herd
of many swine feeding.

8:31 So the devils besought him, @, If thou cast us out, suffer
us to go away into the herd of swine.

8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
into the herd of swine: and, @%, the whole herd of swine ran
violently down a steep @' into the sea, and perished in the @Zs.

8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went @ ways into the city,
and told @ @7, and what was befallen to the possessed of the
devils.

8:34 And, @%, the whole city came out to meet @: and when they
saw him, they besought him that he @L depart out of @ coasts.

9:1 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
city.

9:2 And, @%, they @ to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
a bed: and @ seeing @ faith said unto the sick of the palsy;
Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be for@= thee.

9:3 And, @%, certain of the scribes said within @T, This
man blasphemeth.

9:4 And @ knowing @ thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
your @s?  9:5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be for@=
thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  9:6 But that ye may know that the
Son of man hath power on @ to forgive sins, (then @
 he to the
sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto @ @.

9:7 And he arose, and departed to his @.

9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
@ had @= such power unto men.

9:9 And as @ passed @ from thence, he saw a man, named
Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he @
 unto him,
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

9:10 And it came to pass, as @ sat at meat in the @, @%,
many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his
disciples.

9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  9:12 But when @
@) that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick.

9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice: for I am not come to call the @ceous, but sinners to
repentance.

9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, @, Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  9:15 And @ said
unto them, Can the @ of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom
@ be taken from them, and then @ they fast.

9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
@ is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is
made worse.

9:17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put
new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

9:18 While he @0 @ @ unto them, @%, @ came a
certain ruler, and worshipped him, @, My daughter is even now
dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she @ live.

9:19 And @ arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

9:20 And, @%, a woman, @ was diseased with an issue of @I
twelve @8, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
@ be whole.

9:22 But @ turned him @+, and when he saw her, he said,
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the
woman was made whole from that hour.

9:23 And when @ came into the ruler's @, and saw the minstrels
and the @ making a noise, 9:24 He said unto them, Give @': for
the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

9:25 But when the @ were put @, he went in, and took her by
the hand, and the maid arose.

9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

9:27 And when @ departed thence, two blind men followed him,
crying, and @, Thou son of @, have mercy on us.

9:28 And when he was come into the @, the blind men came to him:
and @ @
 unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They
said unto him, Yea, Lord.

9:29 Then touched he @ eyes, @, According to your faith be it
unto you.

9:30 And @ eyes were opened; and @ straitly charged them,
@, See that no man know it.

9:31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all
that country.

9:32 As they went out, @%, they @ to him a dumb man
possessed with a devil.

9:33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb @0: and the
multitudes marvelled, @, It was never so seen in @.

9:34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils @E the prince
of the devils.

9:35 And @ went @+ all the @G and villages, teaching in
@ synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
@ sickness and @ disease @ the @.

9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
them, @ they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having
no shepherd.

9:37 Then @
 he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
but the labourers are few; 9:38 Pray ye @fore the Lord of the
harvest, that he will send @ labourers into his harvest.

10:1 And when he had @, unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
them power @
 unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all
manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are @; The @O, Simon,
who is @, Peter, and Andrew his @X; James the son of Zebedee,
and John his @X; 10:3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and
Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose
surname was Thaddaeus; 10:4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot,
who also betrayed him.

10:5 These twelve @ sent @, and @M them, @, Go not
into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans
enter ye not: 10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the @ of
@.

10:7 And as ye go, preach, @, The kingdom of @1 is at hand.

10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

10:9 Provide @" gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10:10
Nor scrip for your journey, @" two coats, @" shoes, nor yet
staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

10:11 And into whatsoever city or town ye @ enter, enquire who in
it is worthy; and @ abide till ye go thence.

10:12 And when ye come into an @, salute it.

10:13 And if the @ be worthy, let your @U come upon it: but if
it be not worthy, let your @U return to you.

10:14 And whosoever @ not receive you, nor hear your @5, when
ye depart out of that @ or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

10:15 Verily I say unto you, It @ be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

10:16 @., I send you @ as sheep in the @a of wolves: be ye
@fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
and they will scourge you in @ synagogues; 10:18 And ye @ be
@ @	 governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony
@
 them and the Gentiles.

10:19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye

10:20 For it is not ye that @K, but the Spirit of your Father @
@Keth in you.

10:21 And the @X @ deliver up the @X to @^, and the

10:22 And ye @ be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that

10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into @F:
for verily I say unto you, Ye @ not have gone over the @G of

10:24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the @< above his
lord.

10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
@< as his lord. If they have @, the master of the @
Beelzebub, how much more @ they call them of his @hold?  10:26
Fear them not @fore: for @ is no@7 covered, that @ not

10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that @K ye in light: and what ye

10:28 And fear not them @ kill the body, but are not able to kill

10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a far@7? and one of them @
not fall on the ground @S your Father.

10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

10:31 Fear ye not @fore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

10:32 Whosoever @fore @ confess me @	 men, him will I

10:33 But whosoever @ deny me @	 men, him will I also deny

10:34 Think not that I am come to send @U on @: I came not to

10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance @

10:36 And a man's foes @ be they of his own @hold.

10:37 He that loveth @ or m@C more than me is not worthy of

10:39 He that findeth his life @ lose it: and he that loseth his

10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me

11:1 And it came to pass, when @ had made an end of commanding his
twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in @
@G.

11:2 Now when John had @) in the prison the works of @2, he
sent two of his disciples, 11:3 And said unto him, Art thou he that
@# come, or do we look for @F?  11:4 @ @> and said
unto them, Go and shew John @* @J @ @ ye do hear and
see: 11:5 The blind receive @ sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor
have the gospel preached to them.

11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever @ not be offended in me.

11:7 And as they departed, @ began to say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken with the wind?  11:8 But what went ye out for to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment?  @%, they that wear soft clo@7 are in
kings' @s.

11:9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,
and more than a prophet.

11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, @., I send my
messenger @	 thy face, @ @ prepare thy way @	 thee.

11:11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women @
hath not risen a @er than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he
that is least in the kingdom of @1 is @er than he.

11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
@1 suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, @ was for to come.

11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

11:16 But whereunto @ I liken this generation? It is like unto
@ sitting in the markets, and calling unto @ fellows, 11:17
And @, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

11:18 For John came @" eating nor @bing, and they say, He hath
a devil.

11:19 The Son of man came eating and @bing, and they say, @. a
man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is justified of her @.

11:20 Then began he to upbraid the @G wherein most of his @By
works were done, @ they repented not: 11:21 Woe unto thee,
Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the @By works, @
were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they @L have
repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

11:22 But I say unto you, It @ be more tolerable for Tyre and
Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

11:23 And thou, Capernaum, @ art exalted unto @1, @ be
@ down to hell: for if the @By works, @ have been done in
thee, had been done in Sodom, it @L have remained until this day.

11:24 But I say unto you, That it @ be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

11:25 At that time @ @> and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of @1 and @, @ thou hast hid @ @ from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

11:27 All @ are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
knoweth the Son, but the Father; @" knoweth any man the Father,
save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.

11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.

11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
in @: and ye @ find rest unto your souls.

11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

12:1 At that time @ went on the sabbath day @E the corn; and
his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and
to eat.

12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, @., thy
disciples do that @ is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what @ did, when he
was an hungred, and they that were with him; 12:4 How he entered into
the @ of God, and did eat the shew@d, @ was not lawful for
him to eat, @" for them @ were with him, but only for the
@6s?  12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath
days the @6s in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
12:6 But I say unto you, That in this @' is one @er than the
temple.

12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice, ye @L not have condemned the guiltless.

12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into @ synagogue:
12:10 And, @%, @ was a man @ had his hand wi@d. And
they asked him, @, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that
they @B accuse him.

12:11 And he said unto them, What man @ @ be @ you, that
@ have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day,
will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  12:12 How much then is a
man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
sabbath days.

12:13 Then @
 he to the man, Stretch @ @ hand. And he
stretched it @; and it was restored whole, like as the @C.

12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council @
 him, how
they @B destroy him.

12:15 But when @ knew it, he withdrew @9 from thence: and
@ multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 12:16 And
charged them that they @# not make him known: 12:17 That it @B
be fulfilled @ was spoken by Esaias the prophet, @, 12:18
@. my @<, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is
well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he @ shew
judgment to the Gentiles.

12:19 He @ not strive, nor cry; @" @ any man hear his
@; in the streets.

12:20 A bruised reed @ he not break, and smoking flax @ he not
quench, till he send @ judgment unto victory.

12:21 And in his name @ the Gentiles trust.

12:22 Then was @ unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both @0
and saw.

12:23 And all the @ were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
@?  12:24 But when the Pharisees @) it, they said, This fellow
doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

12:25 And @ knew @ thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
divided @
 itself is @ to desolation; and @ city or
@ divided @
 itself @ not stand: 12:26 And if Satan cast
out Satan, he is divided @
 @9; how @ then his kingdom
stand?  12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
@ cast them out? @fore they @ be your judges.

12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
of God is come unto you.

12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's @, and spoil
his goods, except he @O bind the strong man? and then he will spoil
his @.

12:30 He that is not with me is @
 me; and he that ga@th not
with me scattereth abroad.

12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy @
be for@= unto men: but the blasphemy @
 the Holy Ghost @
not be for@= unto men.

12:32 And whosoever @Keth a word @
 the Son of man, it @
be for@= him: but whosoever @Keth @
 the Holy Ghost, it
@ not be for@= him, @" in this world, @" in the world
to come.

12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his
fruit.

12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, @K good
@?  for out of the abundance of the @ the @P @Keth.

12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the @ @(eth @
good @: and an evil man out of the evil treasure @(eth @
evil @.

12:36 But I say unto you, That @ idle word that men @ @K,
they @ give account @of in the day of judgment.

12:37 For by thy @5 thou @ be justified, and by thy @5 thou
@ be condemned.

12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees @>,
@, Master, we @L see a sign from thee.

12:39 But he @> and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh @ a sign; and @ @ no sign be @= to
it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: 12:40 For as Jonas was @@
days and @@ nights in the whale's belly; so @ the Son of man be
@@ days and @@ nights in the @ of the @.

12:41 The men of Nineveh @ rise in judgment with this generation,
and @ condemn it: @ they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, @%, a @er than Jonas is here.

12:42 The queen of the south @ rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and @ condemn it: for she came from the uttermost
parts of the @ to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, @%, a
@er than Solomon is here.

12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh @E
dry @'s, seeking rest, and findeth none.

12:44 Then he @
, I will return into my @ from whence I came
out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with @9 @H @C spirits more
wicked than @9, and they enter in and dwell @: and the last
state of that man is worse than the @O. Even so @ it be also
unto this wicked generation.

12:46 While he yet talked to the @, @%, his m@C and his
@3 stood @S, desiring to @K with him.

12:47 Then one said unto him, @., thy m@C and thy @3
stand @S, desiring to @K with thee.

12:48 But he @> and said unto him that told him, Who is my
m@C?  and who are my @3?  12:49 And he stretched @ his
hand toward his disciples, and said, @. my m@C and my @3!
12:50 For whosoever @ do the will of my Father @ is in @1,
the same is my @X, and sister, and m@C.

13:1 The same day went @ out of the @, and sat by the sea
side.

13:2 And @ multitudes were ga@d @? unto him, so that he
went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

13:3 And he @0 many @ unto them in parables, @, @., a
sower went @ to sow; 13:4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by
the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 13:5 Some fell
upon stony @'s, where they had not much @: and @with they
sprung up, @ they had no deepness of @: 13:6 And when the
sun was up, they were scorched; and @ they had no root, they
wi@d away.

13:7 And some fell @ thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
them: 13:8 But @C fell into good ground, and @ @ fruit,
some an @/fold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

13:9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why @Kest thou
unto them in parables?  13:11 He @> and said unto them, Because
it is @= unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of @1,
but to them it is not @=.

13:12 For whosoever hath, to him @ be @=, and he @ have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him @ be taken away
even that he hath.

13:13 @N @K I to them in parables: @ they seeing see
not; and hearing they hear not, @" do they @[stand.

13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, @ @
, By
hearing ye @ hear, and @ not @[stand; and seeing ye @
see, and @ not perceive: 13:15 For this @'s @ is waxed
gross, and @ ears are dull of hearing, and @ eyes they have
closed; lest at any time they @# see with @ eyes and hear with
@ ears, and @# @[stand with @ @, and @# be
converted, and I @# heal them.

13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
hear.

13:17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and @ceous men
have desired to see @J @ @ ye see, and have not seen them;
and to hear @J @ @ ye hear, and have not @) them.

13:18 Hear ye @fore the parable of the sower.

13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and @[standeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that @ was
sown in his @. This is he @ received seed by the way side.

13:20 But he that received the seed into stony @'s, the same is he
that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 13:21 Yet hath
he not root in @9, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation
or persecution ariseth @ of the word, by and by he is offended.

13:22 He also that received seed @ the thorns is he that heareth
the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
heareth the word, and @[standeth it; @ also beareth fruit, and
@(eth @, some an @/fold, some sixty, some thirty.

13:24 An@C parable put he @ unto them, @, The kingdom of
@1 is likened unto a man @ sowed good seed in his field: 13:25
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares @ the wheat,
and went his way.

13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and @ @ fruit, then
appeared the tares also.

13:27 So the @<s of the @holder came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it
tares?  13:28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The @<s
said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  13:29
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them.

13:30 Let both grow @? until the harvest: and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye @? @O the tares,
and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my
barn.

13:31 An@C parable put he @ unto them, @, The kingdom of
@1 is like to a grain of mustard seed, @ a man took, and sowed
in his field: 13:32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when
it is grown, it is the @est @ herbs, and becometh a tree, so
that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches @of.

13:33 An@C parable @0 he unto them; The kingdom of @1 is
like unto leaven, @ a woman took, and hid in @@ measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.

13:34 All @ @ @0 @ unto the multitude in parables; and
@S a parable @0 he not unto them: 13:35 That it @B be
fulfilled @ was spoken by the prophet, @, I will open my

from the @Vation of the world.

13:36 Then @ sent the multitude away, and went into the @: and
his disciples came unto him, @, Declare unto us the parable of
the tares of the field.

13:37 He @> and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
the Son of man; 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the
@ of the kingdom; but the tares are the @ of the wicked
one; 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the
end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

13:40 As @fore the tares are ga@d and burned in the fire; so
@ it be in the end of this world.

13:41 The Son of man @ send @ his angels, and they @
gather out of his kingdom all @ that offend, and them @ do
iniquity; 13:42 And @ cast them into a furnace of fire: @
@ be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

13:43 Then @ the @ceous shine @ as the sun in the kingdom
of @ Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

13:44 Again, the kingdom of @1 is like unto treasure hid in a
field; the @ when a man hath @V, he hideth, and for joy @of
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

13:45 Again, the kingdom of @1 is like unto a merchant man,
seeking goodly pearls: 13:46 Who, when he had @V one pearl of @
price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

13:47 Again, the kingdom of @1 is like unto a net, that was cast
into the sea, and ga@d of @ kind: 13:48 Which, when it was
full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and ga@d the good into
vessels, but cast the bad away.

13:49 So @ it be at the end of the world: the angels @ come
@, and sever the wicked from @ the just, 13:50 And @ cast
them into the furnace of fire: @ @ be wailing and gnashing of
teeth.

13:51 @ @
 unto them, Have ye @[stood all @ @? They
say unto him, Yea, Lord.

13:52 Then said he unto them, @N @ scribe @ is
instructed unto the kingdom of @1 is like unto a man that is an
@holder, @ @(eth @ out of his treasure @ new and
old.

13:53 And it came to pass, that when @ had finished @
parables, he departed thence.

13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
@ synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence
hath this man this wisdom, and @ @By works?  13:55 Is not this
the carpenter's son? is not his m@C @, Mary? and his @3,
James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  13:56 And his sisters, are
they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all @ @?
13:57 And they were offended in him. But @ said unto them, A
prophet is not @S honour, save in his own country, and in his own
@.

13:58 And he did not many @By works @ @ of @
unbelief.

14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch @) of the fame of @, 14:2
And said unto his @<s, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from
the dead; and @fore @By works do shew @ @T in him.

14:3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
prison for Herodias' sake, his @X Philip's wife.

14:4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

14:5 And when he @L have put him to @^, he feared the multitude,
@ they counted him as a prophet.

14:6 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
danced @	 them, and pleased Herod.

14:7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
@L ask.

14:8 And she, being @	 instructed of her m@C, said, Give me
here John Baptist's head in a charger.

14:9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
them @ sat with him at meat, he @M it to be @= her.

14:10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

14:11 And his head was @ in a charger, and @= to the damsel:
and she @ it to her m@C.

14:12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
went and told @.

14:13 When @ @) of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
@' apart: and when the @ had @) @of, they followed him
on foot out of the @G.

14:14 And @ went @, and saw a @ multitude, and was moved
with compassion toward them, and he healed @ sick.

14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, @, This
is a desert @', and the time is now past; send the multitude away,
that they may go into the villages, and buy @T victuals.

14:16 But @ said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to
eat.

14:17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
fishes.

14:18 He said, Bring them hither to me.

14:19 And he @M the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to @1, he
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.

14:20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

14:21 And they that had eaten were @+ five @: men, beside
women and @.

14:22 And straightway @ constrained his disciples to get into a
ship, and to go @	 him unto the @C side, while he sent the
multitudes away.

14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was @
alone.

14:24 But the ship was now in the @a of the sea, tossed with waves:
for the wind was contrary.

14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night @ went unto them,
walking on the sea.

14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, @, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

14:27 But straightway @ @0 unto them, @, Be of good cheer;
it is I; be not afraid.

14:28 And Peter @> him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the @Z.

14:29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,
he walked on the @Z, to go to @.

14:30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
beginning to sink, he cried, @, Lord, save me.

14:31 And immediately @ stretched @ his hand, and caught him,
and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, @,
Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

14:34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret.

14:35 And when the men of that @' had knowledge of him, they sent
out into all that country round @+, and @ unto him all that
were diseased; 14:36 And besought him that they @B only touch the
hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

15:1 Then came to @ scribes and Pharisees, @ were of
@ , @, 15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition
of the elders? for they wash not @ @D when they eat @d.

15:3 But he @> and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
commandment of God by your tradition?  15:4 For God @M, @,
Honour thy @ and m@C: and, He that curseth @ or m@C,
let him die the @^.

15:5 But ye say, Whosoever @ say to his @ or his m@C, It
is a gift, by whatsoever thou @Best be profited by me; 15:6 And
honour not his @ or his m@C, he @ be free. Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, @, 15:8 This
@ draweth nigh unto me with @ @P, and honoureth me with
@ lips; but @ @ is far from me.

15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.

15:10 And he @, the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
@[stand: 15:11 Not that @ goeth into the @P defileth a man;
but that @ cometh out of the @P, this defileth a man.

15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
the Pharisees were offended, @ they @) this @?  15:13 But
he @> and said, Every plant, @ my @1ly Father hath not
planted, @ be rooted up.

15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
blind lead the blind, both @ fall into the ditch.

15:15 Then @> Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
parable.

15:16 And @ said, Are ye also yet @S @[standing?  15:17 Do
not ye yet @[stand, that whatsoever entereth in at the @P goeth
into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  15:18 But @J
@ @ proceed out of the @P come @ from the @; and
they defile the man.

15:19 For out of the @ proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 15:20 These are the
@ @ defile a man: but to eat with unwashen @D defileth not
a man.

15:21 Then @ went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon.

15:22 And, @%, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
cried unto him, @, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of @;
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

15:23 But he @> her not a word. And his disciples came and
besought him, @, Send her away; for she crieth @ us.

15:24 But he @> and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the @ of @.

15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, @, Lord, help me.

15:26 But he @> and said, It is not meet to take the @'s
@d, and to cast it to dogs.

15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs @
fall from @ masters' table.

15:28 Then @ @> and said unto her, O woman, @ is thy
faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour.

15:29 And @ departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down @.

15:30 And @ multitudes came unto him, having with them @J that
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many @Cs, and cast them down at
@' feet; and he healed them: 15:31 Insomuch that the multitude
wondered, when they saw the dumb to @K, the maimed to be whole, the
lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of
@.

15:32 Then @ @, his disciples unto him, and said, I have
compassion on the multitude, @ they continue with me now @@
days, and have no@7 to eat: and I will not send them away fasting,
lest they faint in the way.

15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence @# we have so much
@d in the wilderness, as to fill so @ a multitude?  15:34 And
@ @
 unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven,
and a few little fishes.

15:35 And he @M the multitude to sit down on the ground.

15:36 And he took the @H loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the
multitude.

15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
broken meat that was left @H baskets full.

15:38 And they that did eat were four @: men, beside women and
@.

15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
coasts of Magdala.

16:1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
him that he @L shew them a sign from @1.

16:2 He @> and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

16:3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky
is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the
sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  16:4 A wicked and
adulterous generation seeketh @ a sign; and @ @ no sign be
@= unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them,
and departed.

16:5 And when his disciples were come to the @C side, they had
forgotten to take @d.

16:6 Then @ said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

16:7 And they reasoned @ @T, @, It is @ we have
taken no @d.

16:8 Which when @ perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
faith, why reason ye @ yourselves, @ ye have @ no
@d?  16:9 Do ye not yet @[stand, @" remember the five
loaves of the five @:, and how many baskets ye took up?  16:10
Neither the @H loaves of the four @:, and how many baskets ye
took up?  16:11 How is it that ye do not @[stand that I @0 it
not to you concerning @d, that ye @# beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  16:12 Then @[stood they how
that he bade them not beware of the leaven of @d, but of the
doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

16:13 When @ came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
his disciples, @, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
Elias; and @Cs, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

16:15 He @
 unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  16:16 And Simon
Peter @> and said, Thou art the @2, the Son of the living
God.

16:17 And @ @> and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
Barjona: for @R and @I hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father @ is in @1.

16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell @ not prevail
@
 it.

16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of @1: and
whatsoever thou @ bind on @ @ be bound in @1: and
whatsoever thou @ loose on @ @ be loosed in @1.

16:20 Then charged he his disciples that they @# tell no man that
he was @ the @2.

16:21 From that time @ began @ to shew unto his disciples, how
that he must go unto @ , and suffer many @ of the elders
and chief @6s and scribes, and be killed, and be raised @* the
third day.

16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, @, Be it far
from thee, Lord: this @ not be unto thee.

16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the @ that be
of God, but @J that be of men.

16:24 Then said @ unto his disciples, If any man will come @
me, let him deny @9, and take up his cross, and follow me.

16:25 For whosoever will save his life @ lose it: and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake @ find it.

16:26 For what is a man profited, if he @ gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul? or what @ a man give in exchange for his
soul?  16:27 For the Son of man @ come in the @Y of his Father
with his angels; and then he @ reward @ man @$ to his
works.

16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, @ @
not taste of @^, till they see the Son of man coming in his
kingdom.

17:1 And @ six days @ taketh Peter, James, and John his
@X, and @(eth them up into an high mountain apart, 17:2 And
was transfigured @	 them: and his face did shine as the sun, and
his raiment was white as the light.

17:3 And, @%, @ appeared unto them @ and Elias talking
with him.

17:4 Then @> Peter, and said unto @, Lord, it is good for us
to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here @@ tabernacles; one for
thee, and one for @, and one for Elias.

17:5 While he yet @0, @%, a b@c cloud overshadowed them: and
@% a @; out of the cloud, @ said, This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

17:6 And when the disciples @) it, they fell on @ face, and
were sore afraid.

17:7 And @ came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
afraid.

17:8 And when they had lifted up @ eyes, they saw no man, save
@ only.

17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, @ charged them,
@, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen @*
from the dead.

17:10 And his disciples asked him, @, Why then say the scribes
that Elias must @O come?  17:11 And @ @> and said unto
them, Elias truly @ @O come, and restore all @.

17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise @
also the Son of man suffer of them.

17:13 Then the disciples @[stood that he @0 unto them of John
the Baptist.

17:14 And when they were come to the multitude, @ came to him a
certain man, kneeling down to him, and @, 17:15 Lord, have mercy
on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth
into the fire, and oft into the @Z.

17:16 And I @ him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

17:17 Then @ @> and said, O faithless and perverse
generation, how long @ I be with you? how long @ I suffer you?
@( him hither to me.

17:18 And @ rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
child was cured from that very hour.

17:19 Then came the disciples to @ apart, and said, Why could not
we cast him out?  17:20 And @ said unto them, Because of your
unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye @ say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
@'; and it @ remove; and no@7 @ be impossible unto you.

17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

17:22 And while they abode in Galilee, @ said unto them, The Son
of man @ be betrayed into the @D of men: 17:23 And they @
kill him, and the third day he @ be raised @*.

And they were exceeding sorry.

17:24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
17:25 He @
, Yes. And when he was come into the @, @
prevented him, @, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings
of the @ take custom or tribute? of @ own @, or of
strangers?  17:26 Peter @
 unto him, Of strangers. @ @
 unto
him, Then are the @ free.

17:27 Notwithstanding, lest we @# offend them, go thou to the sea,
and cast an hook, and take up the fish that @O cometh up; and when
thou hast opened his @P, thou @ find a piece of money: that
take, and give unto them for me and thee.

18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto @, @, Who is
the @est in the kingdom of @1?  18:2 And @ @, a little
child unto him, and set him in the @a of them, 18:3 And said,
Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little
@, ye @ not enter into the kingdom of @1.

18:4 Whosoever @fore @ humble @9 as this little child,
the same is @est in the kingdom of @1.

18:5 And whoso @ receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me.

18:6 But whoso @ offend one of @ little ones @ believe in
me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged @+ his
neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

18:7 Woe unto the world @ of offences! for it must needs be that
offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  18:8
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast
them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed, rather than having two @D or two feet to be cast into
everlasting fire.

18:9 And if @ eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of @ little ones; for I
say unto you, That in @1 @ angels do always @% the face of
my Father @ is in @1.

18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that @ was lost.

18:12 How think ye? if a man have an @/ sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that @ is gone astray?  18:13 And if so be
that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that
sheep, than of the ninety and nine @ went not astray.

18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father @ is in @1,
that one of @ little ones @# perish.

18:15 Moreover if thy @X @ trespass @
 thee, go and tell
him his fault between thee and him alone: if he @ hear thee, thou
hast gained thy @X.

18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
more, that in the @P of two or @@ witnesses @ word may be
established.

18:17 And if he @ neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican.

18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye @ bind on @ @
be bound in @1: and whatsoever ye @ loose on @ @ be
loosed in @1.

18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you @ agree on @ as
touching any @7 that they @ ask, it @ be done for them of
my Father @ is in @1.

18:20 For where two or @@ are ga@d @? in my name, @
am I in the @a of them.

18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft @ my @X
sin @
 me, and I forgive him? till @H times?  18:22 @
@
 unto him, I say not unto thee, Until @H times: but, Until
@Hty times @H.

18:23 @N is the kingdom of @1 likened unto a certain king,
@ @L take account of his @<s.

18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was @ unto him, @
owed him ten @: talents.

18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord @M him to be
sold, and his wife, and @, and all that he had, and payment to
be made.

18:26 The @< @fore fell down, and worshipped him, @,
Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

18:27 Then the lord of that @< was moved with compassion, and
loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

18:28 But the same @< went out, and @V one of his
fellow@<s, @ owed him an @/ pence: and he laid @D on
him, and took him by the throat, @, Pay me that thou owest.

18:29 And his fellow@< fell down at his feet, and besought him,
@, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

18:30 And he @L not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
@# pay the debt.

18:31 So when his fellow@<s saw what was done, they were very
sorry, and came and told unto @ lord all that was done.

18:32 Then his lord, @ that he had @, him, said unto him, O
thou wicked @<, I forgave thee all that debt, @ thou
desiredst me: 18:33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellow@<, even as I had pity on thee?  18:34 And his lord was
wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he @# pay all
that was due unto him.

18:35 So likewise @ my @1ly Father do also unto you, if ye
from your @s forgive not @ one his @X @ trespasses.

19:1 And it came to pass, that when @ had finished @ @s,
he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond
Jordan; 19:2 And @ multitudes followed him; and he healed them
@.

19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and @ unto
him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for @ cause?
19:4 And he @> and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
@ made them at the beginning made them male and female, 19:5 And
said, For this cause @ a man leave @ and m@C, and @
cleave to his wife: and they twain @ be one @R?  19:6 Wherefore
they are no more twain, but one @R. What @fore God hath joined
@?, let not man put as@[.

19:7 They say unto him, Why did @ then command to give a writing
of divorcement, and to put her away?  19:8 He @
 unto them, @
@ of the hardness of your @s suffered you to put away your
wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever @ put away his wife, except it
be for fornication, and @ marry @F, committeth adultery: and
whoso marrieth her @ is put away doth commit adultery.

19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
his wife, it is not good to marry.

19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this @, save
they to whom it is @=.

19:12 For @ are some eunuchs, @ were so born from @
m@C's womb: and @ are some eunuchs, @ were made eunuchs of
men: and @ be eunuchs, @ have made @T eunuchs for the
kingdom of @1's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.

19:13 Then were @ @ unto him little @, that he @#
put his @D on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

19:14 But @ said, Suffer little @, and forbid them not, to
come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of @1.

19:15 And he laid his @D on them, and departed thence.

19:16 And, @%, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
@7 @ I do, that I may have eternal life?  19:17 And he said
unto him, Why callest thou me good? @ is none good but one, that
is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

19:18 He @
 unto him, Which? @ said, Thou @ do no murder,
Thou @ not commit adultery, Thou @ not steal, Thou @ not
bear false witness, 19:19 Honour thy @ and thy m@C: and, Thou
@ love thy neighbour as thyself.

19:20 The young man @
 unto him, All @ @ have I kept from
my youth up: what lack I yet?  19:21 @ said unto him, If thou wilt
be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
@ have treasure in @1: and come and follow me.

19:22 But when the young man @) that @, he went away
sorrowful: for he had @ possessions.

19:23 Then said @ unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
a rich man @ hardly enter into the kingdom of @1.

19:24 And @* I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go @E
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God.

19:25 When his disciples @) it, they were exceedingly amazed,
@, Who then can be saved?  19:26 But @ beheld them, and said
unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all @ are
possible.

19:27 Then @> Peter and said unto him, @., we have forsaken
all, and followed thee; what @ we have @fore?  19:28 And @
said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye @ have followed me,
in the regeneration when the Son of man @ sit in the throne of his
@Y, ye also @ sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of @.

19:29 And @ one that hath forsaken @s, or @3, or
sisters, or @, or m@C, or wife, or @, or lands, for my
name's sake, @ receive an @/fold, and @ inherit
everlasting life.

19:30 But many that are @O @ be last; and the last @ be
@O.

20:1 For the kingdom of @1 is like unto a man that is an
@holder, @ went out early in the morning to hire labourers
into his vineyard.

20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
sent them into his vineyard.

20:3 And he went out @+ the third hour, and saw @Cs standing
idle in the market@', 20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the
vineyard, and whatsoever is @c I will give you. And they went @
way.

20:5 Again he went out @+ the sixth and ninth hour, and did
likewise.

20:6 And @+ the eleventh hour he went out, and @V @Cs
standing idle, and @
 unto them, Why stand ye here all the day
idle?  20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He @

unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is @c, that
@ ye receive.

20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard @
 unto his
steward, Call the labourers, and give them @ hire, beginning from
the last unto the @O.

20:9 And when they came that were hired @+ the eleventh hour, they
received @ man a penny.

20:10 But when the @O came, they supposed that they @# have
received more; and they likewise received @ man a penny.

20:11 And when they had received it, they murmured @
 the goodman
of the @, 20:12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and
thou hast made them equal unto us, @ have borne the burden and
heat of the day.

20:13 But he @> one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?  20:14 Take that
@ is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto
thee.

20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
@ eye evil, @ I am good?  20:16 So the last @ be @O,
and the @O last: for many be @,, but few chosen.

20:17 And @ going up to @  took the twelve disciples apart
in the way, and said unto them, 20:18 @., we go up to @ ;
and the Son of man @ be betrayed unto the chief @6s and unto

deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify
him: and the third day he @ rise @*.

20:20 Then came to him the m@C of Zebedees @ with her sons,
worshipping him, and desiring a certain @7 of him.

20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She @
 unto him, Grant
that @ my two sons may sit, the one on thy @c hand, and the
@C on the left, in thy kingdom.

20:22 But @ @> and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
able to @b of the cup that I @ @b of, and to be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are
able.

20:23 And he @
 unto them, Ye @ @b indeed of my cup, and be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my
@c hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it @ be @=

20:24 And when the ten @) it, they were moved with indignation
@
 the two @3.

20:25 But @ @, them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are
@ exercise authority upon them.

20:26 But it @ not be so @ you: but whosoever will be @
@ you, let him be your minister; 20:27 And whosoever will be chief
@ you, let him be your @<: 20:28 Even as the Son of man came
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a
ransom for many.

20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a @ multitude followed
him.

20:30 And, @%, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
@) that @ passed by, cried out, @, Have mercy on us, O
Lord, thou son of @.

20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, @ they @# hold @
@U: but they cried the more, @, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou
son of @.

20:32 And @ stood still, and @, them, and said, What will ye
that I @ do unto you?  20:33 They say unto him, Lord, that our
eyes may be opened.

20:34 So @ had compassion on them, and touched @ eyes: and
immediately @ eyes received sight, and they followed him.

21:1 And when they drew nigh unto @ , and were come to
Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent @ two disciples,
21:2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over @
 you, and
straightway ye @ find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
them, and @( them unto me.

21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye @ say, The Lord hath
need of them; and straightway he will send them.

21:4 All this was done, that it @B be fulfilled @ was spoken by
the prophet, @, 21:5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, @., thy
King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the
foal of an ass.

21:6 And the disciples went, and did as @ @M them, 21:7 And
@ the ass, and the colt, and put on them @ clothes, and they
set him @on.

21:8 And a very @ multitude spread @ garments in the way;
@Cs cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.

21:9 And the multitudes that went @	, and that followed, cried,
@, Hosanna to the son of @: Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

21:10 And when he was come into @ , all the city was moved,
@, Who is this?  21:11 And the multitude said, This is @ the
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

21:12 And @ went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the
moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, 21:13 And said
unto them, It is written, My @ @ be @, the @ of
prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

21:14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
healed them.

21:15 And when the chief @6s and scribes saw the wonderful @
that he did, and the @ crying in the temple, and @,
Hosanna to the son of @; they were sore displeased, 21:16 And said
unto him, Hearest thou what @ say? And @ @
 unto them, Yea;
have ye never read, Out of the @P of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise?  21:17 And he left them, and went out of the city
into Bethany; and he lodged @.

21:18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

21:19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and @V
no@7 @on, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree wi@d
away.

21:20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, @, How soon
is the fig tree wi@d away!  21:21 @ @> and said unto
them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye @
not only do this @ is done to the fig tree, but also if ye @
say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
sea; it @ be done.

21:22 And all @, whatsoever ye @ ask in prayer, believing, ye
@ receive.

21:23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief @6s and the
elders of the @ came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By
what authority doest thou @ @? and who gave thee this
authority?  21:24 And @ @> and said unto them, I also will
ask you one @7, @ if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you
by what authority I do @ @.

21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from @1, or of men? And
they reasoned with @T, @, If we @ say, From @1;
he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?  21:26 But if we
@ say, Of men; we fear the @; for all hold John as a prophet.

21:27 And they @> @, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do @ @.

21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
the @O, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

21:29 He @> and said, I will not: but @ward he repented, and
went.

21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he @>
and said, I go, sir: and went not.

21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his @? They say unto
him, The @O. @ @
 unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God @	 you.

21:32 For John came unto you in the way of @ceousness, and ye
believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and
ye, when ye had seen it, repented not @ward, that ye @B believe
him.

21:33 Hear @F parable: There was a certain @holder, @
planted a vineyard, and hedged it round @+, and digged a winepress
in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into
a far country: 21:34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent
his @<s to the husbandmen, that they @B receive the fruits of
it.

21:35 And the husbandmen took his @<s, and beat one, and killed
@F, and stoned @F.

21:36 Again, he sent @C @<s more than the @O: and they did
unto them likewise.

21:37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, @, They will
reverence my son.

21:38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said @ @T,
This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his
inheritance.

21:39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
him.

21:40 When the lord @fore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do
unto @J husbandmen?  21:41 They say unto him, He will miserably
destroy @J wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto @C
husbandmen, @ @ render him the fruits in @ seasons.

21:42 @ @
 unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
stone @ the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the
corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
21:43 @N say I unto you, The kingdom of God @ be taken from
you, and @= to a nation @(ing @ the fruits @of.

21:44 And whosoever @ fall on this stone @ be broken: but on
whomsoever it @ fall, it will grind him to powder.

21:45 And when the chief @6s and Pharisees had @) his parables,
they perceived that he @0 of them.

21:46 But when they sought to lay @D on him, they feared the
multitude, @ they took him for a prophet.

22:1 And @ @> and @0 unto them @* by parables, and
said, 22:2 The kingdom of @1 is like unto a certain king, @
made a marriage for his son, 22:3 And sent @ his @<s to call
them that were bidden to the wedding: and they @L not come.

22:4 Again, he sent @ @C @<s, @, Tell them @ are
bidden, @., I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are
killed, and all @ are ready: come unto the marriage.

22:5 But they made light of it, and went @ ways, one to his farm,
@F to his merchandise: 22:6 And the remnant took his @<s,
and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.

22:7 But when the king @) @of, he was wroth: and he sent @
his armies, and destroyed @J murderers, and burned up @ city.

22:8 Then @
 he to his @<s, The wedding is ready, but they
@ were bidden were not worthy.

22:9 Go ye @fore into the highways, and as many as ye @ find,
bid to the marriage.

22:10 So @J @<s went out into the highways, and ga@d
@? all as many as they @V, both bad and good: and the wedding
was furnished with guests.

22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw @ a man
@ had not on a wedding garment: 22:12 And he @
 unto him,
Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he
was speechless.

22:13 Then said the king to the @<s, Bind him hand and foot, and
take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, @ @ be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

22:14 For many are @,, but few are chosen.

22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they @B
entangle him in his talk.

22:16 And they sent out unto him @ disciples with the Herodians,
@, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of
God in truth, @" carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not
the person of men.

22:17 Tell us @fore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
tribute unto Caesar, or not?  22:18 But @ perceived @
wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  22:19 Shew me
the tribute money. And they @ unto him a penny.

22:20 And he @
 unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
22:21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then @
 he unto them, Render
@fore unto Caesar the @ @ are Caesar's; and unto God the
@ that are God's.

22:22 When they had @) @ @5, they marvelled, and left him,
and went @ way.

22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, @ say that @ is
no resurrection, and asked him, 22:24 Saying, Master, @ said, If a
man die, having no @, his @X @ marry his wife, and
raise up seed unto his @X.

22:25 Now @ were with us @H @3: and the @O, when he
had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto
his @X: 22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the
@Hth.

22:27 And last of all the woman died also.

22:28 @N in the resurrection whose wife @ she be of the
@H?  for they all had her.

22:29 @ @> and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
scriptures, nor the power of God.

22:30 For in the resurrection they @" marry, nor are @= in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in @1.

22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
that @ was spoken unto you by God, @, 22:32 I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of @]?  God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living.

22:33 And when the multitude @) this, they were astonished at his
doctrine.

22:34 But when the Pharisees had @) that he had put the Sadducees
to silence, they were ga@d @?.

22:35 Then one of them, @ was a lawyer, asked him a question,
tempting him, and @, 22:36 Master, @ is the @ commandment
in the law?  22:37 @ said unto him, Thou @ love the Lord thy
God with all thy @, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

22:38 This is the @O and @ commandment.

22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou @ love thy neighbour as
thyself.

22:40 On @ two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

22:41 While the Pharisees were ga@d @?, @ asked them,
22:42 Saying, What think ye of @2? whose son is he? They say unto
him, The son of @.

22:43 He @
 unto them, How then doth @ in spirit call him Lord,
@, 22:44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my @c hand,
till I make @ enemies thy footstool?  22:45 If @ then call him
Lord, how is he his son?  22:46 And no man was able to answer him a
word, @" durst any man from that day @ ask him any more
questions.

23:1 Then @0 @ to the multitude, and to his disciples, 23:2
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in @' seat: 23:3 All
@fore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do
not ye @ @ works: for they say, and do not.

23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men's @#ers; but they @T will not move them with
one of @ fingers.

23:5 But all @ works they do for to be seen of men: they make
broad @ phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of @ garments,
23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
the synagogues, 23:7 And greetings in the markets, and to be @, of
men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

23:8 But be not ye @, Rabbi: for one is your Master, even @2;
and all ye are @3.

23:9 And call no man your @ upon the @: for one is your
Father, @ is in @1.

23:10 Neither be ye @, masters: for one is your Master, even
@2.

23:11 But he that is @est @ you @ be your @<.

23:12 And whosoever @ exalt @9 @ be abased; and he that
@ humble @9 @ be exalted.

23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
up the kingdom of @1 @
 men: for ye @" go in yourselves,
@" suffer ye them that are entering to go in.

23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
widows' @s, and for a pretence make long prayer: @fore ye
@ receive the @er damnation.

23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.

23:16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, @ say, Whosoever @ swear
by the temple, it is no@7; but whosoever @ swear by the gold of

And, Whosoever @ swear by the @\, it is no@7; but whosoever

23:19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is @er, the gift, or the

23:22 And he that @ swear by @1, sweareth by the throne of
God, and by him that sitteth @on.

23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier
matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: @ ought ye to have
done, and not to leave the @C undone.

23:24 Ye blind guides, @ strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
full of extortion and excess.

23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse @O that @ is within the cup
and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like

within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear @ceous unto men, but within

23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! @ ye

23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the

23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your @s.

23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the

@I shed upon the @, from the @I of @ceous Abel unto the

23:36 Verily I say unto you, All @ @ @ come upon this

23:37 O @ , @ , thou that killest the prophets, and

24:1 And @ went out, and departed from the temple: and his

24:2 And @ said unto them, See ye not all @ @? verily I

24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto

24:5 For many @ come in my name, @, I am @2; and @

24:6 And ye @ hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not

24:7 For nation @ rise @

24:8 All @ are the beginning of sorrows.

24:9 Then @ they deliver you up to be afflicted, and @ kill

24:10 And then @ many be offended, and @ betray one @F,

24:11 And many false prophets @ rise, and @ deceive many.

24:12 And @ iniquity @ abound, the love of many @ wax

24:15 When ye @fore @ see the abomination of desolation,

24:19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give

24:23 Then if any man @ say unto you, Lo, here is @2, or

24:24 For @ @ arise false @2s, and false prophets, and

24:27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even

24:31 And he @ send his angels with a @ sound of a trumpet,

24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet

24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of

24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so @ also the coming of the Son

delayeth his coming; 24:49 And @ begin to smite his
fellow@<s, and to eat and @b with the drunken; 24:50 The lord
of that @< @ come in a day when he looketh not for him, and
in an hour that he is not aware of, 24:51 And @ cut him as@[,
and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: @ @ be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

25:1 Then @ the kingdom of @1 be likened unto ten virgins,
@ took @ lamps, and went @ to meet the bridegroom.

25:2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

25:3 They that were foolish took @ lamps, and took no oil with
them: 25:4 But the wise took oil in @ vessels with @ lamps.

25:5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

25:6 And at midnight @ was a cry made, @., the bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him.

25:7 Then all @J virgins arose, and trimmed @ lamps.

25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps are gone out.

25:9 But the wise @>, @, Not so; lest @ be not enough
for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves.

25:10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

25:11 Afterward came also the @C virgins, @, Lord, Lord, open
to us.

25:12 But he @> and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

25:13 Watch @fore, for ye know @" the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh.

25:14 For the kingdom of @1 is as a man travelling into a far
country, who @, his own @<s, and delivered unto them his
goods.

25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to @F two, and to
@F one; to @ man @$ to his several ability; and
straightway took his journey.

25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them @C five talents.

25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained @C two.

25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the @, and
hid his lord's money.

25:19 After a long time the lord of @J @<s cometh, and
reckoneth with them.

25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and @ @C
five talents, @, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:
@%, I have gained beside them five talents more.

25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
@<: thou hast been faithful over a few @, I will make thee
ruler over many @: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: @%, I have gained two @C
talents beside them.

25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful @<;
thou hast been faithful over a few @, I will make thee ruler over
many @: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

25:24 Then he @ had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 And I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the @: lo, @ thou hast that is
@.

25:26 His lord @> and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
@<, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest @fore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I @# have received mine
own with usury.

25:28 Take @fore the talent from him, and give it unto him @
hath ten talents.

25:29 For unto @ one that hath @ be @=, and he @ have
abundance: but from him that hath not @ be taken away even that
@ he hath.

25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable @< into outer darkness: @
@ be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

25:31 When the Son of man @ come in his @Y, and all the holy
angels with him, then @ he sit upon the throne of his @Y: 25:32
And @	 him @ be ga@d all nations: and he @ separate
them one from @F, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats: 25:33 And he @ set the sheep on his @c hand, but the
goats on the left.

25:34 Then @ the King say unto them on his @c hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
@Vation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me
meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me @b: I was a stranger, and ye
took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited
me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

25:37 Then @ the @ceous answer him, @, Lord, when saw we
thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee @b?  25:38
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed
thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto
thee?  25:40 And the King @ answer and say unto them, Verily I say
unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of @
my @3, ye have done it unto me.

25:41 Then @ he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was
thirsty, and ye gave me no @b: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took
me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye
visited me not.

25:44 Then @ they also answer him, @, Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then @ he answer
them, @, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of @, ye did it not to me.

25:46 And @ @ go away into everlasting punishment: but the
@ceous into life eternal.

26:1 And it came to pass, when @ had finished all @ @s,
he said unto his disciples, 26:2 Ye know that @ two days is the
feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

26:3 Then assembled @? the chief @6s, and the scribes, and
the elders of the @, unto the palace of the high @6, who was
@, Caiaphas, 26:4 And consulted that they @B take @ by
subtilty, and kill him.

26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest @ be an uproar
@ the @.

26:6 Now when @ was in Bethany, in the @ of Simon the leper,
26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, @, To
what purpose is this waste?  26:9 For this ointment @B have been
sold for much, and @= to the poor.

26:10 When @ @[stood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it
for my burial.

26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel @ be preached
in the whole world, @ @ also this, that this woman hath done,
be told for a memorial of her.

26:14 Then one of the twelve, @, Judas Iscariot, went unto the
chief @6s, 26:15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I
will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty
pieces of silver.

26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

26:17 Now the @O day of the feast of unleavened @d the disciples
came to @, @ unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for
thee to eat the passover?  26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such
a man, and say unto him, The Master @
, My time is at hand; I will
keep the passover at thy @ with my disciples.

26:19 And the disciples did as @ had appointed them; and they made
ready the passover.

26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of
you @ betray me.

26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began @ one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  26:23 And he @> and said, He
that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same @ betray me.

26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man
if he had not been born.

26:25 Then Judas, @ betrayed him, @> and said, Master, is it
I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.

26:26 And as they were eating, @ took @d, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is
my body.

26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
@, Drink ye all of it; 26:28 For this is my @I of the new
testament, @ is shed for many for the remission of sins.

26:29 But I say unto you, I will not @b hence@ of this fruit of
the vine, until that day when I @b it new with you in my Father's
kingdom.

26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.

26:31 Then @
 @ unto them, All ye @ be offended @ of
me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock @ be scattered abroad.

26:32 But @ I am risen @*, I will go @	 you into Galilee.

26:33 Peter @> and said unto him, Though all men @ be
offended @ of thee, yet will I never be offended.

26:34 @ said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
@	 the cock crow, thou @ deny me thrice.

26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I @# die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

26:36 Then cometh @ with them unto a @' @, Gethsemane, and
@
 unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

26:38 Then @
 he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto @^: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
@, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
@
 unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  26:41
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the @R is weak.

26:42 He went away @* the second time, and prayed, @, O my
Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I @b it, thy
will be done.

26:43 And he came and @V them asleep @*: for @ eyes were
heavy.

26:44 And he left them, and went away @*, and prayed the third
time, @ the same @5.

26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and @
 unto them, Sleep on
now, and take your rest: @%, the hour is at hand, and the Son of
man is betrayed into the @D of sinners.

26:46 Rise, let us be going: @%, he is at hand that doth betray
me.

26:47 And while he yet @0, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
with him a @ multitude with @Qs and staves, from the chief
@6s and elders of the @.

26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, @, Whomsoever I
@ kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

26:49 And @with he came to @, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.

26:50 And @ said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid @D on @ and took him.

26:51 And, @%, one of them @ were with @ stretched out his
hand, and drew his @Q, and struck a @< of the high @6's,
and smote off his ear.

26:52 Then said @ unto him, Put up @* thy @Q into his @':
for all they that take the @Q @ perish with the @Q.

26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he @
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  26:54 But how
then @ the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  26:55
In that same hour said @ to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
@
 a thief with @Qs and staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets @B
be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

26:57 And they that had laid hold on @ led him away to Caiaphas
the high @6, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high @6's palace,
and went in, and sat with the @<s, to see the end.

26:59 Now the chief @6s, and elders, and all the council, sought
false witness @
 @, to put him to @^; 26:60 But @V
none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet @V they none. At
the last came two false witnesses, 26:61 And said, This fellow said, I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in @@ days.

26:62 And the high @6 arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
no@7? what is it @ @ witness @
 thee?  26:63 But @
held his @U, And the high @6 @> and said unto him, I
adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the
@2, the Son of God.

26:64 @ @
 unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
you, Here@ @ ye see the Son of man sitting on the @c hand
of power, and coming in the clouds of @1.

26:65 Then the high @6 rent his clothes, @, He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? @%, now ye have
@) his blasphemy.

26:66 What think ye? They @> and said, He is guilty of @^.

26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and @Cs
smote him with the palms of @ @D, 26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto
us, thou @2, Who is he that smote thee?  26:69 Now Peter sat
@S in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, @, Thou also
wast with @ of Galilee.

26:70 But he denied @	 them all, @, I know not what thou
sayest.

26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, @F maid saw him,
and said unto them that were @, This fellow was also with @ of
Nazareth.

26:72 And @* he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

26:73 And @ a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.

26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, @, I know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.

26:75 And Peter remembered the word of @, @ said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou @ deny me thrice. And he went out, and
wept bitterly.

27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief @6s and elders of
the @ took counsel @
 @ to put him to @^: 27:2 And
when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
Pontius Pilate the governor.

27:3 Then Judas, @ had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
condemned, repented @9, and @ @* the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief @6s and elders, 27:4 Saying, I have sinned in
that I have betrayed the innocent @I. And they said, What is that
to us? see thou to that.

27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
departed, and went and hanged @9.

27:6 And the chief @6s took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
lawful for to put them into the treasury, @ it is the price of
@I.

27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.

27:8 Wherefore that field was @,, The field of @I, unto this
day.

27:9 Then was fulfilled that @ was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
@, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him
that was valued, whom they of the @ of @ did value; 27:10
And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

27:11 And @ stood @	 the governor: and the governor asked him,
@, Art thou the King of the Jews? And @ said unto him, Thou
sayest.

27:12 And when he was accused of the chief @6s and elders, he
@> no@7.

27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many @ they
witness @
 thee?  27:14 And he @> him to never a word;
insomuch that the governor marvelled @ly.

27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
@ a prisoner, whom they @L.

27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, @, Barabbas.

27:17 @N when they were ga@d @?, Pilate said unto
them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or @ @
is @, @2?  27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered
him.

27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
him, @, Have thou no@7 to do with that just man: for I have
suffered many @ this day in a dream @ of him.

27:20 But the chief @6s and elders persuaded the multitude that
they @# ask Barabbas, and destroy @.

27:21 The governor @> and said unto them, Whether of the twain
will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

27:22 Pilate @
 unto them, What @ I do then with @ @ is
@, @2? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
cried out the more, @, Let him be crucified.

27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail no@7, but that rather a
tumult was made, he took @Z, and washed his @D @	 the
multitude, @, I am innocent of the @I of this just person: see
ye to it.

27:25 Then @> all the @, and said, His @I be on us, and
on our @.

27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
@, he delivered him to be crucified.

27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took @ into the common
hall, and ga@d unto him the whole band of soldiers.

27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
his head, and a reed in his @c hand: and they bowed the knee @	
him, and mocked him, @, Hail, King of the Jews!  27:30 And they
spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

27:31 And @ that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

27:32 And as they came out, they @V a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
him they compelled to bear his cross.

27:33 And when they were come unto a @' @, Golgotha, that is to
say, a @' of a skull, 27:34 They gave him vinegar to @b mingled
with gall: and when he had tasted @of, he @L not @b.

27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
that it @B be fulfilled @ was spoken by the prophet, They
parted my garments @ them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

27:36 And sitting down they watched him @; 27:37 And set up over
his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27:38 Then were @ two thieves crucified with him, one on the @c
hand, and @F on the left.

27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging @ heads, 27:40
And @, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in @@
days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross.

27:41 Likewise also the chief @6s mocking him, with the scribes
and elders, said, 27:42 He saved @Cs; @9 he cannot save. If he
be the King of @, let him now come down from the cross, and we
will believe him.

27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
for he said, I am the Son of God.

27:44 The thieves also, @ were crucified with him, cast the same
in his teeth.

27:45 Now from the sixth hour @ was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour.

27:46 And @+ the ninth hour @ cried with a loud @;, @,
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?  27:47 Some of them that stood @, when they
@) that, said, This man calleth for Elias.

27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to @b.

27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
save him.

27:50 @, when he had cried @* with a loud @;, yielded up the
ghost.

27:51 And, @%, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom; and the @ did quake, and the rocks rent; 27:52
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints @ slept
arose, 27:53 And came out of the graves @ his resurrection, and
went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
@, saw the @quake, and @J @ that were done, they
feared @ly, @, Truly this was the Son of God.

27:55 And many women were @ @%ing afar off, @ followed
@ from Galilee, ministering unto him: 27:56 Among @ was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the m@C of James and Joses, and the m@C of
Zebedees @.

27:57 When the even was come, @ came a rich man of Arimathaea,
named Joseph, who also @9 was @' disciple: 27:58 He went to
Pilate, and begged the body of @. Then Pilate @M the body
to be delivered.

27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth, 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, @ he had hewn
out in the rock: and he rolled a @ stone to the door of the
sepulchre, and departed.

27:61 And @ was Mary Magdalene, and the @C Mary, sitting over
@
 the sepulchre.

27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
chief @6s and Pharisees came @? unto Pilate, 27:63 Saying,
Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,
After @@ days I will rise @*.

27:64 Command @fore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and
say unto the @, He is risen from the dead: so the last error
@ be worse than the @O.

27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as
sure as ye can.

27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
and setting a watch.

28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the @O
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the @C Mary to see the
sepulchre.

28:2 And, @%, @ was a @ @quake: for the angel of the
Lord descended from @1, and came and rolled back the stone from
the door, and sat upon it.

28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
snow: 28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as
dead men.

28:5 And the angel @> and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for
I know that ye seek @, @ was crucified.

28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the @'
where the Lord lay.

28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
dead; and, @%, he goeth @	 you into Galilee; @ @ ye
see him: lo, I have told you.

28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and @
joy; and did run to @( his disciples word.

28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, @%, @ met them,
@, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and
worshipped him.

28:10 Then said @ unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my @3
that they go into Galilee, and @ @ they see me.

28:11 Now when they were going, @%, some of the watch came into
the city, and shewed unto the chief @6s all the @ that were
done.

28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 28:13 Saying, Say
ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

28:14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
and secure you.

28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
@ is commonly reported @ the Jews until this day.

28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
mountain where @ had appointed them.

28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

28:18 And @ came and @0 unto them, @, All power is @=
unto me in @1 and in @.

28:19 Go ye @fore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20
Teaching them to observe all @ whatsoever I have @M you:
and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.




The Gospel According to Saint Mark


1:1 The beginning of the gospel of @ @2, the Son of God; 1:2
As it is written in the prophets, @., I send my messenger @	
thy face, @ @ prepare thy way @	 thee.

1:3 The @; of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his paths straight.

1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins.

1:5 And @ went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
@ , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
confessing @ sins.

1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
skin @+ his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 1:7 And
preached, @, There cometh one @Bier than I @ me, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

1:8 I indeed have baptized you with @Z: but he @ baptize you
with the Holy Ghost.

1:9 And it came to pass in @J days, that @ came from Nazareth
of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

1:10 And straightway coming up out of the @Z, he saw the @1s
opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 1:11 And @
came a @; from @1, @, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased.

1:12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

1:13 And he was @ in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.

1:14 Now @ that John was put in prison, @ came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 1:15 And @, The time
is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and
believe the gospel.

1:16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
his @X casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

1:17 And @ said unto them, Come ye @ me, and I will make you
to become fishers of men.

1:18 And straightway they forsook @ nets, and followed him.

1:19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
son of Zebedee, and John his @X, who also were in the ship
mending @ nets.

1:20 And straightway he @, them: and they left @ @
Zebedee in the ship with the hired @<s, and went @ him.

1:21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day
he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

1:22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as
one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

1:23 And @ was in @ synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
and he cried out, 1:24 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
thee, thou @ of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God.

1:25 And @ rebuked him, @, Hold thy @U, and come out of
him.

1:26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
@;, he came out of him.

1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned @
@T, @, What @7 is this? what new doctrine is this? for
with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do
obey him.

1:28 And immediately his fame spread abroad @Eout all the region
round @+ Galilee.

1:29 And @with, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
entered into the @ of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

1:30 But Simon's wife's m@C lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
him of her.

1:31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

1:32 And at even, when the sun did set, they @ unto him all that
were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

1:33 And all the city was ga@d @? at the door.

1:34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
out many devils; and suffered not the devils to @K, @ they
knew him.

1:35 And in the morning, rising up a @ while @	 day, he went
out, and departed into a solitary @', and @ prayed.

1:36 And Simon and they that were with him followed @ him.

1:37 And when they had @V him, they said unto him, All men seek for
thee.

1:38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
preach @ also: for @fore came I @.

1:39 And he preached in @ synagogues @Eout all Galilee, and
cast out devils.

1:40 And @ came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
to him, and @ unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

1:41 And @, moved with compassion, put @ his hand, and touched
him, and @
 unto him, I will; be thou clean.

1:42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
from him, and he was cleansed.

1:43 And he straitly charged him, and @with sent him away; 1:44
And @
 unto him, See thou say no@7 to any man: but go thy way,
shew thyself to the @6, and offer for thy cleansing @J @
@ @ @M, for a testimony unto them.

1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
abroad the matter, insomuch that @ could no more openly enter into
the city, but was @S in desert @'s: and they came to him from
@ quarter.

2:1 And @* he entered into Capernaum @ some days; and it was
noised that he was in the @.

2:2 And straightway many were ga@d @?, insomuch that @
was no room to receive them, no, not so much as @+ the door: and he
preached the word unto them.

2:3 And they come unto him, @(ing one sick of the palsy, @ was
borne of four.

2:4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

2:5 When @ saw @ faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
Son, thy sins be for@= thee.

2:6 But @ was certain of the scribes sitting @, and reasoning
in @ @s, 2:7 Why doth this man thus @K blasphemies? who can
forgive sins but God only?  2:8 And immediately when @ perceived
in his spirit that they so reasoned within @T, he said unto
them, Why reason ye @ @ in your @s?  2:9 Whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be for@= thee; or
to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?  2:10 But that ye may
know that the Son of man hath power on @ to forgive sins, (he
@
 to the sick of the palsy,) 2:11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take
up thy bed, and go thy way into @ @.

2:12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went @ @	
them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God,
@, We never saw it on this fashion.

2:13 And he went @ @* by the sea side; and all the multitude
resorted unto him, and he taught them.

2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at
the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and
followed him.

2:15 And it came to pass, that, as @ sat at meat in his @,
many publicans and sinners sat also @? with @ and his
disciples: for @ were many, and they followed him.

2:16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and
@beth with publicans and sinners?  2:17 When @ @) it, he
@
 unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician,
but they that are sick: I came not to call the @ceous, but sinners
to repentance.

2:18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?  2:19 And @ said unto
them, Can the @ of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they
cannot fast.

2:20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom @ be taken away
from them, and then @ they fast in @J days.

2:21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else
the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent
is made worse.

2:22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine
doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will
be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.

2:23 And it came to pass, that he went @E the corn fields on the
sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears
of corn.

2:24 And the Pharisees said unto him, @., why do they on the
sabbath day that @ is not lawful?  2:25 And he said unto them,
Have ye never read what @ did, when he had need, and was an
hungred, he, and they that were with him?  2:26 How he went into the
@ of God in the days of Abiathar the high @6, and did eat the
shew@d, @ is not lawful to eat but for the @6s, and gave
also to them @ were with him?  2:27 And he said unto them, The
sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 2:28 @N
the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

3:1 And he entered @* into the synagogue; and @ was a man @
@ had a wi@d hand.

3:2 And they watched him, whether he @L heal him on the sabbath
day; that they @B accuse him.

3:3 And he @
 unto the man @ had the wi@d hand, Stand
@.

3:4 And he @
 unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held @
@U.

3:5 And when he had looked round @+ on them with anger, being
grieved for the hardness of @ @s, he @
 unto the man,
Stretch @ @ hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was
restored whole as the @C.

3:6 And the Pharisees went @, and straightway took counsel with
the Herodians @
 him, how they @B destroy him.

3:7 But @ withdrew @9 with his disciples to the sea: and a
@ multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, 3:8 And
from @ , and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they
@+ Tyre and Sidon, a @ multitude, when they had @) what
@ @ he did, came unto him.

3:9 And he @0 to his disciples, that a small ship @# wait on
him @ of the multitude, lest they @# throng him.

3:10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for
to touch him, as many as had plagues.

3:11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down @	 him, and
cried, @, Thou art the Son of God.

3:12 And he straitly charged them that they @# not make him known.

3:13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
@L: and they came unto him.

3:14 And he ordained twelve, that they @# be with him, and that he
@B send them @ to preach, 3:15 And to have power to heal
sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 3:16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;
3:17 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the @X of James; and
he surnamed them Boanerges, @ is, The sons of th@[: 3:18 And
Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and
James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
3:19 And Judas Iscariot, @ also betrayed him: and they went into
an @.

3:20 And the multitude cometh @? @*, so that they could not
so much as eat @d.

3:21 And when his friends @) of it, they went out to lay hold on
him: for they said, He is beside @9.

3:22 And the scribes @ came down from @  said, He hath
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

3:23 And he @, them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
can Satan cast out Satan?  3:24 And if a kingdom be divided @

itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

3:25 And if a @ be divided @
 itself, that @ cannot
stand.

3:26 And if Satan rise up @
 @9, and be divided, he cannot
stand, but hath an end.

3:27 No man can enter into a strong man's @, and spoil his goods,
except he will @O bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his
@.

3:28 Verily I say unto you, All sins @ be for@= unto the sons
of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they @ blaspheme: 3:29
But he that @ blaspheme @
 the Holy Ghost hath never
for@=ess, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

3:30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

3:31 There came then his @3 and his m@C, and, standing
@S, sent unto him, calling him.

3:32 And the multitude sat @+ him, and they said unto him, @.,
thy m@C and thy @3 @S seek for thee.

3:33 And he @> them, @, Who is my m@C, or my @3?
3:34 And he looked round @+ on them @ sat @+ him, and said,
@. my m@C and my @3!  3:35 For whosoever @ do the
will of God, the same is my @X, and my sister, and m@C.

4:1 And he began @* to teach by the sea side: and @ was
ga@d unto him a @ multitude, so that he entered into a ship,
and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the
land.

4:2 And he taught them many @ by parables, and said unto them in
his doctrine, 4:3 Hearken; @., @ went out a sower to sow: 4:4
And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the
fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much @; and
immediately it sprang up, @ it had no depth of @: 4:6 But
when the sun was up, it was scorched; and @ it had no root, it
wi@d away.

4:7 And some fell @ thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
and it yielded no fruit.

4:8 And @C fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased; and @ @, some thirty, and some sixty, and
some an @/.

4:9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

4:10 And when he was alone, they that were @+ him with the twelve
asked of him the parable.

4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is @= to know the mystery
of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are @S, all @
@ are done in parables: 4:12 That seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not @[stand; lest at any
time they @# be converted, and @ sins @# be for@= them.

4:13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
will ye know all parables?  4:14 The sower soweth the word.

4:15 And @ are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
when they have @), Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the
word that was sown in @ @s.

4:16 And @ are they likewise @ are sown on stony ground; who,
when they have @) the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
4:17 And have no root in @T, and so endure but for a time:
@ward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
immediately they are offended.

4:18 And @ are they @ are sown @ thorns; such as hear the
word, 4:19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of
riches, and the lusts of @C @ entering in, choke the word, and
it becometh unfruitful.

4:20 And @ are they @ are sown on good ground; such as hear
the word, and receive it, and @( @ fruit, some thirtyfold, some
sixty, and some an @/.

4:21 And he said unto them, Is a candle @ to be put @[ a
bushel, or @[ a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?  4:22 For
@ is no@7 hid, @ @ not be manifested; @" was any
@7 kept secret, but that it @# come abroad.

4:23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
ye mete, it @ be measured to you: and unto you that hear @
more be @=.

4:25 For he that hath, to him @ be @=: and he that hath not,
from him @ be taken even that @ he hath.

4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man @# cast
seed into the ground; 4:27 And @# sleep, and rise night and day,
and the seed @# spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

4:28 For the @ @(eth @ fruit of herself; @O the blade,
then the ear, @ that the full corn in the ear.

4:29 But when the fruit is @ @, immediately he putteth in
the sickle, @ the harvest is come.

4:30 And he said, Whereunto @ we liken the kingdom of God? or with
what comparison @ we compare it?  4:31 It is like a grain of
mustard seed, @, when it is sown in the @, is less than all
the seeds that be in the @: 4:32 But when it is sown, it groweth
up, and becometh @er than all herbs, and shooteth out @
branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge @[ the shadow of
it.

4:33 And with many such parables @0 he the word unto them, as they
were able to hear it.

4:34 But @S a parable @0 he not unto them: and when they were
alone, he expounded all @ to his disciples.

4:35 And the same day, when the even was come, he @
 unto them, Let
us pass over unto the @C side.

4:36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
he was in the ship. And @ were also with him @C little ships.

4:37 And @ arose a @ storm of wind, and the waves beat into
the ship, so that it was now full.

4:38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we
perish?  4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the
sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and @ was a @ calm.

4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
have no faith?  4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to
@F, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea
obey him?  5:1 And they came over unto the @C side of the sea, into
the country of the Gadarenes.

5:2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately @ met him
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 5:3 Who had his
dwelling @ the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with
chains: 5:4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and
chains, and the chains had been plucked as@[ by him, and the
fetters broken in pieces: @" could any man tame him.

5:5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
tombs, crying, and cutting @9 with stones.

5:6 But when he saw @ afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And
cried with a loud @;, and said, What have I to do with thee, @,
thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment
me not.

5:8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.

5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he @>, @, My
name is Legion: for we are many.

5:10 And he besought him much that he @L not send them away out of
the country.

5:11 Now @ was @ nigh unto the mountains a @ herd of swine
feeding.

5:12 And all the devils besought him, @, Send us into the swine,
that we may enter into them.

5:13 And @with @ gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a
steep @' into the sea, (they were @+ two @:;) and were
choked in the sea.

5:14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

5:15 And they come to @, and see him that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his @c
mind: and they were afraid.

5:16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

5:17 And they began to pray him to depart out of @ coasts.

5:18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he @B be with him.

5:19 Howbeit @ suffered him not, but @
 unto him, Go home to
thy friends, and tell them how @ @ the Lord hath done for
thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

5:20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how @
@ @ had done for him: and all men did marvel.

5:21 And when @ was passed over @* by ship unto the @C side,
much @ ga@d unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.

5:22 And, @%, @ cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 5:23 And
besought him @ly, @, My little daughter lieth at the point of
@^: I pray thee, come and lay thy @D on her, that she may be
healed; and she @ live.

5:24 And @ went with him; and much @ followed him, and
thronged him.

5:25 And a certain woman, @ had an issue of @I twelve @8,
5:26 And had suffered many @ of many physicians, and had spent
all that she had, and was no@7 bettered, but rather grew worse,
5:27 When she had @) of @, came in the press behind, and
touched his garment.

5:28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I @ be whole.

5:29 And straightway the fountain of her @I was dried up; and she
felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

5:30 And @, immediately knowing in @9 that virtue had gone
out of him, turned him @+ in the press, and said, Who touched my
clothes?  5:31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the
multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  5:32 And
he looked round @+ to see her that had done this @7.

5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
her, came and fell down @	 him, and told him all the truth.

5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;
go in @U, and be whole of thy plague.

5:35 While he yet @0, @ came from the ruler of the synagogue's
@ certain @ said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the
Master any further?  5:36 As soon as @ @) the word that was
spoken, he @
 unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only
believe.

5:37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and
John the @X of James.

5:38 And he cometh to the @ of the ruler of the synagogue, and
seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed @ly.

5:39 And when he was come in, he @
 unto them, Why make ye this
ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

5:40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
he taketh the @ and the m@C of the damsel, and them that were
with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

5:41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
cumi; @ is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.

5:42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the
age of twelve @8. And they were astonished with a @
astonishment.

5:43 And he charged them straitly that no man @# know it; and
@M that some@7 @# be @= her to eat.

6:1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
his disciples follow him.

6:2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, @, From whence
hath this man @ @? and what wisdom is this @ is @=
unto him, that even such @By works are wrought by his @D?  6:3
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the @X of James, and
Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?
And they were offended at him.

6:4 But @, said unto them, A prophet is not @S honour, but in
his own country, and @ his own kin, and in his own @.

6:5 And he could @ do no @By work, save that he laid his @D
upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

6:6 And he marvelled @ of @ unbelief. And he went round
@+ the villages, teaching.

6:7 And he @, unto him the twelve, and began to send them @ by
two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 6:8 And
@M them that they @# take no@7 for @ journey, save a
staff only; no scrip, no @d, no money in @ purse: 6:9 But be
shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

6:10 And he said unto them, In what @' soever ye enter into an
@, @ abide till ye depart from that @'.

6:11 And whosoever @ not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the dust @[ your feet for a testimony @

them.

Verily I say unto you, It @ be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

6:12 And they went out, and preached that men @# repent.

6:13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
were sick, and healed them.

6:14 And king Herod @) of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and
@fore @By works do shew @ @T in him.

6:15 Others said, That it is Elias. And @Cs said, That it is a
prophet, or as one of the prophets.

6:16 But when Herod @) @of, he said, It is John, whom I
beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

6:17 For Herod @9 had sent @ and laid hold upon John, and
bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his @X Philip's wife: for
he had married her.

6:18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have
thy @X's wife.

6:19 @N Herodias had a quarrel @
 him, and @L have
killed him; but she could not: 6:20 For Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he
@) him, he did many @, and @) him gladly.

6:21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of
Galilee; 6:22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said
unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
thee.

6:23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou @ ask of me, I will
give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

6:24 And she went @, and said unto her m@C, What @ I ask?
And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

6:25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
@, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
John the Baptist.

6:26 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
for @ sakes @ sat with him, he @L not reject her.

6:27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and @M his
head to be @: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 6:28
And @ his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the
damsel gave it to her m@C.

6:29 And when his disciples @) of it, they came and took up his
corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

6:30 And the apostles ga@d @T @? unto @, and
told him all @, both what they had done, and what they had
taught.

6:31 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
@', and rest a while: for @ were many coming and going, and
they had no leisure so much as to eat.

6:32 And they departed into a desert @' by ship privately.

6:33 And the @ saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
afoot thither out of all @G, and outwent them, and came @?
unto him.

6:34 And @, when he came out, saw much @, and was moved with
compassion toward them, @ they were as sheep not having a
shepherd: and he began to teach them many @.

6:35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,
and said, This is a desert @', and now the time is far passed: 6:36
Send them away, that they may go into the country round @+, and
into the villages, and buy @T @d: for they have no@7 to
eat.

6:37 He @> and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
unto him, Shall we go and buy two @/ pennyworth of @d, and
give them to eat?  6:38 He @
 unto them, How many loaves have ye?
go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

6:39 And he @M them to make all sit down by companies upon the
green grass.

6:40 And they sat down in ranks, by @/s, and by fifties.

6:41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
looked up to @1, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them
to his disciples to set @	 them; and the two fishes divided he
@ them all.

6:42 And they did all eat, and were filled.

6:43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
fishes.

6:44 And they that did eat of the loaves were @+ five @: men.

6:45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
ship, and to go to the @C side @	 unto Bethsaida, while he sent
away the @.

6:46 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
pray.

6:47 And when even was come, the ship was in the @a of the sea, and
he alone on the land.

6:48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
them: and @+ the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,
walking upon the sea, and @L have passed by them.

6:49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had
been a spirit, and cried out: 6:50 For they all saw him, and were
troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and @
 unto them, Be
of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.

6:51 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
they were sore amazed in @T beyond measure, and wondered.

6:52 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for @
@ was hardened.

6:53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

6:54 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
him, 6:55 And ran @E that whole region round @+, and began to
carry @+ in beds @J that were sick, where they @) he was.

6:56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or @G, or
country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they
@B touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as
touched him were made whole.

7:1 Then came @? unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
scribes, @ came from @ .

7:2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat @d with defiled,
that is to say, with unwashen, @D, they @V fault.

7:3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash @ @D
oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
not.

And many @C @ @ be, @ they have received to hold, as
the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

7:5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
disciples @$ to the tradition of the elders, but eat @d with
unwashen @D?  7:6 He @> and said unto them, Well hath Esaias
prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This @ honoureth
me with @ lips, but @ @ is far from me.

7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.

7:8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many @C such like @
ye do.

7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
that ye may keep your own tradition.

7:10 For @ said, Honour thy @ and thy m@C; and, Whoso
curseth @ or m@C, let him die the @^: 7:11 But ye say, If a
man @ say to his @ or m@C, It is Corban, that is to say, a
gift, by whatsoever thou @Best be profited by me; he @ be free.

7:12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his @ or his
m@C; 7:13 Making the word of God of none effect @E your
tradition, @ ye have delivered: and many such like @ do ye.

7:14 And when he had @, all the @ unto him, he said unto
them, Hearken unto me @ one of you, and @[stand: 7:15 There is
no@7 from @S a man, that entering into him can defile him: but
the @ @ come out of him, @J are they that defile the man.

7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

7:17 And when he was entered into the @ from the @, his
disciples asked him concerning the parable.

7:18 And he @
 unto them, Are ye so @S @[standing also? Do
ye not perceive, that whatsoever @7 from @S entereth into the
man, it cannot defile him; 7:19 Because it entereth not into his
@, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all
meats?  7:20 And he said, That @ cometh out of the man, that
defileth the man.

7:21 For from within, out of the @ of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders, 7:22 Thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,
foolishness: 7:23 All @ evil @ come from within, and defile
the man.

7:24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon, and entered into an @, and @L have no man know it: but
he could not be hid.

7:25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
@) of him, and came and fell at his feet: 7:26 The woman was a
Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he @L
cast @ the devil out of her daughter.

7:27 But @ said unto her, Let the @ @O be filled: for it
is not meet to take the @'s @d, and to cast it unto the
dogs.

7:28 And she @> and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs @[
the table eat of the @'s crumbs.

7:29 And he said unto her, For this @ go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter.

7:30 And when she was come to her @, she @V the devil gone out,
and her daughter laid upon the bed.

7:31 And @*, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, @E the @a of the coasts of Decapolis.

7:32 And they @( unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 7:34 And looking
up to @1, he sighed, and @
 unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be
opened.

7:35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
tongue was loosed, and he @0 plain.

7:36 And he charged them that they @# tell no man: but the more he
charged them, so much the more a @ deal they published it; 7:37
And were beyond measure astonished, @, He hath done all @
well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to @K.

8:1 In @J days the multitude being very @, and having no@7
to eat, @ @, his disciples unto him, and @
 unto them, 8:2
I have compassion on the multitude, @ they have now been with me
@@ days, and have no@7 to eat: 8:3 And if I send them away
fasting to @ own @s, they will faint by the way: for divers of
them came from far.

8:4 And his disciples @> him, From whence can a man satisfy
@ men with @d here in the wilderness?  8:5 And he asked them,
How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

8:6 And he @M the @ to sit down on the ground: and he took
the @H loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his
disciples to set @	 them; and they did set them @	 the @.

8:7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and @M to
set them also @	 them.

8:8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
meat that was left @H baskets.

8:9 And they that had eaten were @+ four @:: and he sent them
away.

8:10 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

8:11 And the Pharisees came @, and began to question with him,
seeking of him a sign from @1, tempting him.

8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and @
, Why doth this
generation seek @ a sign? verily I say unto you, There @ no
sign be @= unto this generation.

8:13 And he left them, and entering into the ship @* departed to
the @C side.

8:14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take @d, @" had they
in the ship with them more than one loaf.

8:15 And he charged them, @, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

8:16 And they reasoned @ @T, @, It is @ we have
no @d.

8:17 And when @ knew it, he @
 unto them, Why reason ye,
@ ye have no @d? perceive ye not yet, @" @[stand?
have ye your @ yet hardened?  8:18 Having eyes, see ye not? and
having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?  8:19 When I brake
the five loaves @ five @:, how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

8:20 And when the @H @ four @:, how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

8:21 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not @[stand?  8:22
And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they @( a blind man unto him, and
besought him to touch him.

8:23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his @D upon him, he
asked him if he saw ought.

8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

8:25 After that he put his @D @* upon his eyes, and made him
look up: and he was restored, and saw @ man clearly.

8:26 And he sent him away to his @, @, Neither go into the
town, nor tell it to any in the town.

8:27 And @ went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, @ unto them,
Whom do men say that I am?  8:28 And they @>, John the Baptist;
but some say, Elias; and @Cs, One of the prophets.

8:29 And he @
 unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and @
 unto him, Thou art the @2.

8:30 And he charged them that they @# tell no man of him.

8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
@, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief @6s, and
scribes, and be killed, and @ @@ days rise @*.

8:32 And he @0 that @ openly. And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.

8:33 But when he had turned @+ and looked on his disciples, he
rebuked Peter, @, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest
not the @ that be of God, but the @ that be of men.

8:34 And when he had @, the @ unto him with his disciples
also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come @ me, let him deny
@9, and take up his cross, and follow me.

8:35 For whosoever will save his life @ lose it; but whosoever
@ lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same @ save
it.

8:36 For what @ it profit a man, if he @ gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?  8:37 Or what @ a man give in exchange for

Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the @Y of his Father with
the holy angels.

9:1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That @ be some
of them that stand here, @ @ not taste of @^, till they
have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

9:2 And @ six days @ taketh with him Peter, and James, and
John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by @T:
and he was transfigured @	 them.

9:3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
fuller on @ can white them.

9:4 And @ appeared unto them Elias with @: and they were
talking with @.

9:5 And Peter @> and said to @, Master, it is good for us to
be here: and let us make @@ tabernacles; one for thee, and one for
@, and one for Elias.

9:6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

9:7 And @ was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a @; came out
of the cloud, @, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

9:8 And suddenly, when they had looked round @+, they saw no man
any more, save @ only with @T.

9:9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
@# tell no man what @ they had seen, till the Son of man were
risen from the dead.

9:10 And they kept that @ with @T, questioning one with
@F what the rising from the dead @# mean.

9:11 And they asked him, @, Why say the scribes that Elias must
@O come?  9:12 And he @> and told them, Elias verily cometh
@O, and restoreth all @; and how it is written of the Son of
man, that he must suffer many @, and be set at nought.

9:13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

9:14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a @ multitude @+
them, and the scribes questioning with them.

9:15 And straightway all the @, when they beheld him, were
@ly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

9:16 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?  9:17 And
one of the multitude @> and said, Master, I have @ unto
thee my son, @ hath a dumb spirit; 9:18 And wheresoever he taketh
him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and
pineth away: and I @0 to thy disciples that they @# cast him
out; and they could not.

9:19 He answereth him, and @
, O faithless generation, how long
@ I be with you? how long @ I suffer you? @( him unto me.

9:20 And they @ him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway
the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

9:21 And he asked his @, How long is it ago since this came unto
him?  And he said, Of a child.

9:22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the @Zs,
to destroy him: but if thou canst do any @7, have compassion on us,
and help us.

9:23 @ said unto him, If thou canst believe, all @ are
possible to him that believeth.

9:24 And straightway the @ of the child cried out, and said with
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

9:25 When @ saw that the @ came running @?, he rebuked
the foul spirit, @ unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge
thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.

9:26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and
he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

9:27 But @ took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

9:28 And when he was come into the @, his disciples asked him
privately, Why could not we cast him out?  9:29 And he said unto them,
This kind can come @ by no@7, but by prayer and fasting.

9:30 And they departed thence, and passed @E Galilee; and he
@L not that any man @# know it.

9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man
is delivered into the @D of men, and they @ kill him; and @
that he is killed, he @ rise the third day.

9:32 But they @[stood not that @, and were afraid to ask him.

9:33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the @ he asked them,
What was it that ye disputed @ yourselves by the way?  9:34 But
they held @ @U: for by the way they had disputed @
@T, who @# be the @est.

9:35 And he sat down, and @, the twelve, and @
 unto them, If
any man desire to be @O, the same @ be last of all, and @<
of all.

9:36 And he took a child, and set him in the @a of them: and when
he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 9:37 Whosoever @
receive one of such @ in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever
@ receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

9:38 And John @> him, @, Master, we saw one casting out
devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him,
@ he followeth not us.

9:39 But @ said, Forbid him not: for @ is no man @ @
do a miracle in my name, that can lightly @K evil of me.

9:40 For he that is not @
 us is on our part.

9:41 For whosoever @ give you a cup of @Z to @b in my name,
@ ye belong to @2, verily I say unto you, he @ not lose
his reward.

9:42 And whosoever @ offend one of @ little ones that believe
in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged @+ his
neck, and he were cast into the sea.

9:43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter into life maimed, than having two @D to go into hell, into
the fire that never @ be quenched: 9:44 Where @ worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.

9:45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into
the fire that never @ be quenched: 9:46 Where @ worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.

9:47 And if @ eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to
be cast into hell fire: 9:48 Where @ worm dieth not, and the fire

9:49 For @ one @ be salted with fire, and @ sacrifice
@ be salted with salt.

9:50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith
will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have @U one with
@F.

10:1 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
the farther side of Jordan: and the @ resort unto him @*; and,
as he was wont, he taught them @*.

10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife? tempting him.

10:3 And he @> and said unto them, What did @ command you?
10:4 And they said, @ suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
to put her away.

10:5 And @ @> and said unto them, For the hardness of your

10:6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and

10:7 For this cause @ a man leave his @ and m@C, and

they are no more twain, but one @R.

10:9 What @fore God hath joined @?, let not man put as@[.

10:10 And in the @ his disciples asked him @* of the same

10:11 And he @

10:12 And if a woman @ put away her husband, and be married to
@F, she committeth adultery.

10:13 And they @ young @ to him, that he @# touch
them: and his disciples rebuked @J that @ them.

10:14 But when @ saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
them, Suffer the little @ to come unto me, and forbid them not:
for of such is the kingdom of God.

10:15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever @ not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child, he @ not enter @in.

10:16 And he took them up in his arms, put his @D upon them, and
blessed them.

10:17 And when he was gone @ into the way, @ came one running,
and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what @ I do that I
may inherit eternal life?  10:18 And @ said unto him, Why callest
thou me good? @ is none good but one, that is, God.

10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy
@ and m@C.  10:20 And he @> and said unto him, Master,
all @ have I observed from my youth.

10:21 Then @ @%ing him loved him, and said unto him, One @7
thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou @ have treasure in @1: and come, take up the
cross, and follow me.

10:22 And he was sad at that @, and went away grieved: for he had
@ possessions.

10:23 And @ looked round @+, and @
 unto his disciples, How
hardly @ they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his @5. But @
answereth @*, and @
 unto them, Children, how hard is it for
them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  10:25 It
is easier for a camel to go @E the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

10:26 And they were astonished out of measure, @ @
@T, Who then can be saved?  10:27 And @ looking upon them
@
, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all
@ are possible.

10:28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
followed thee.

10:29 And @ @> and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
man that hath left @, or @3, or sisters, or @, or
m@C, or wife, or @, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
10:30 But he @ receive an @/fold now in this time, @s,
and @3, and sisters, and m@Cs, and @, and lands, with
persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

10:31 But many that are @O @ be last; and the last @O.

10:32 And they were in the way going up to @ ; and @ went
@	 them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were
afraid.

And he took @* the twelve, and began to tell them what @
@# happen unto him, 10:33 Saying, @., we go up to @ ;
and the Son of man @ be delivered unto the chief @6s, and unto
the scribes; and they @ condemn him to @^, and @ deliver
him to the Gentiles: 10:34 And they @ mock him, and @ scourge
him, and @ spit upon him, and @ kill him: and the third day he
@ rise @*.

10:35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, @,
Master, we @L that thou @#est do for us whatsoever we @
desire.

10:36 And he said unto them, What @L ye that I @# do for you?
10:37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
@c hand, and the @C on thy left hand, in thy @Y.

10:38 But @ said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye @b
of the cup that I @b of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with?  10:39 And they said unto him, We can. And @ said
unto them, Ye @ indeed @b of the cup that I @b of; and with
the baptism that I am baptized withal @ ye be baptized: 10:40 But
to sit on my @c hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but
it @ be @= to them for whom it is prepared.

10:41 And when the ten @) it, they began to be much displeased with
James and John.

10:42 But @ @, them to him, and @
 unto them, Ye know that
they @ are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them; and @ @ ones exercise authority upon them.

10:43 But so @ it not be @ you: but whosoever will be @
@ you, @ be your minister: 10:44 And whosoever of you will be
the chiefest, @ be @< of all.

10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

10:46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a @ number of @, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

10:47 And when he @) that it was @ of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, and say, @, thou son of @, have mercy on me.

10:48 And many charged him that he @# hold his @U: but he cried
the more a @ deal, Thou son of @, have mercy on me.

10:49 And @ stood still, and @M him to be @,. And they
call the blind man, @ unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he
calleth thee.

10:50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to @.

10:51 And @ @> and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
@# do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I @B
receive my sight.

10:52 And @ said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
whole.

And immediately he received his sight, and followed @ in the way.

11:1 And when they came nigh to @ , unto Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount of Olives, he sendeth @ two of his disciples, 11:2
And @
 unto them, Go your way into the village over @
 you:
and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye @ find a colt tied,
whereon never man sat; loose him, and @( him.

11:3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.

11:4 And they went @ way, and @V the colt tied by the door
@S in a @' where two ways met; and they loose him.

11:5 And certain of them that stood @ said unto them, What do ye,
loosing the colt?  11:6 And they said unto them even as @ had
@M: and they let them go.

11:7 And they @ the colt to @, and cast @ garments on
him; and he sat upon him.

11:8 And many spread @ garments in the way: and @Cs cut down
branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

11:9 And they that went @	, and they that followed, cried, @,
Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 11:10
Blessed be the kingdom of our @ @, that cometh in the name of
the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

11:11 And @ entered into @ , and into the temple: and when
he had looked round @+ upon all @, and now the eventide was
come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
hungry: 11:13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came,
if haply he @B find any @7 @on: and when he came to it, he
@V no@7 but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

11:14 And @ @> and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
here@ for ever. And his disciples @) it.

11:15 And they come to @ : and @ went into the temple, and
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that
sold doves; 11:16 And @L not suffer that any man @# carry any
vessel @E the temple.

11:17 And he taught, @ unto them, Is it not written, My @
@ be @, of all nations the @ of prayer? but ye have made
it a den of thieves.

11:18 And the scribes and chief @6s @) it, and sought how they
@B destroy him: for they feared him, @ all the @ was
astonished at his doctrine.

11:19 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

11:20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots.

11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance @
 unto him, Master, @%,
the fig tree @ thou cursedst is wi@d away.

11:22 And @ answering @
 unto them, Have faith in God.

11:23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever @ say unto this
mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and @
not doubt in his @, but @ believe that @J @ @ he
@
 @ come to pass; he @ have whatsoever he @
.

11:24 @N I say unto you, What @ soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye @ have them.

11:25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought @

any: that your Father also @ is in @1 may forgive you your
trespasses.

11:26 But if ye do not forgive, @" will your Father @ is in
@1 forgive your trespasses.

11:27 And they come @* to @ : and as he was walking in the
temple, @ come to him the chief @6s, and the scribes, and the
elders, 11:28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou @
@? and who gave thee this authority to do @ @?  11:29
And @ @> and said unto them, I will also ask of you one
question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do
@ @.

11:30 The baptism of John, was it from @1, or of men? answer me.

11:31 And they reasoned with @T, @, If we @ say, From
@1; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?  11:32 But if we
@ say, Of men; they feared the @: for all men counted John,
that he was a prophet indeed.

11:33 And they @> and said unto @, We cannot tell. And @
answering @
 unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I
do @ @.

12:1 And he began to @K unto them by parables. A certain man
planted a vineyard, and set an hedge @+ it, and digged a @' for
the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
into a far country.

12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a @<, that he
@B receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

12:4 And @* he sent unto them @F @<; and at him they cast
stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
handled.

12:5 And @* he sent @F; and him they killed, and many @Cs;
beating some, and killing some.

12:6 Having yet @fore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
last unto them, @, They will reverence my son.

12:7 But @J husbandmen said @ @T, This is the heir;
come, let us kill him, and the inheritance @ be our's.

12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
vineyard.

12:9 What @ @fore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto @Cs.

12:10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone @ the
builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 12:11 This was the
Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  12:12 And they sought
to lay hold on him, but feared the @: for they knew that he had
spoken the parable @
 them: and they left him, and went @
way.

12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his @5.

12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to
give tribute to Caesar, or not?  12:15 Shall we give, or @ we not
give? But he, knowing @ hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye
me? @( me a penny, that I may see it.

12:16 And they @ it. And he @
 unto them, Whose is this image
and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

12:17 And @ answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the @
that are Caesar's, and to God the @ that are God's. And they
marvelled at him.

12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, @ say @ is no
resurrection; and they asked him, @, 12:19 Master, @ wrote
unto us, If a man's @X die, and leave his wife behind him, and
leave no @, that his @X @# take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his @X.

12:20 Now @ were @H @3: and the @O took a wife, and
dying left no seed.

12:21 And the second took her, and died, @" left he any seed: and
the third likewise.

12:22 And the @H had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
died also.

12:23 In the resurrection @fore, when they @ rise, whose wife
@ she be of them? for the @H had her to wife.

12:24 And @ answering said unto them, Do ye not @fore err,
@ ye know not the scriptures, @" the power of God?  12:25
For when they @ rise from the dead, they @" marry, nor are
@= in marriage; but are as the angels @ are in @1.

12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
the book of @, how in the bush God @0 unto him, @, I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of @]?  12:27
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye @fore
do @ly err.

12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having @) them reasoning
@?, and perceiving that he had @> them well, asked him,
Which is the @O commandment of all?  12:29 And @ @> him,
The @O of all the commandments is, Hear, O @; The Lord our God
is one Lord: 12:30 And thou @ love the Lord thy God with all thy
@, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength: this is the @O commandment.

12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou @ love thy
neighbour as thyself. There is none @C commandment @er than
@.

12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
truth: for @ is one God; and @ is none @C but he: 12:33 And
to love him with all the @, and with all the @[standing, and
with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his
neighbour as @9, is more than all whole @_ @&s and
sacrifices.

12:34 And when @ saw that he @> discreetly, he said unto
him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man @ that
durst ask him any question.

12:35 And @ @> and said, while he taught in the temple, How
say the scribes that @2 is the son of @?  12:36 For @
@9 said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on
my @c hand, till I make @ enemies thy footstool.

12:37 @ @fore @9 calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
his son? And the common @ @) him gladly.

12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
@ love to go in long clo@7, and love salutations in the
market@'s, 12:39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the
uppermost rooms at feasts: 12:40 Which devour widows' @s, and for
a pretence make long prayers: @ @ receive @er damnation.

12:41 And @ sat over @
 the treasury, and beheld how the
@ cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in
much.

12:42 And @ came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
@ make a far@7.

12:43 And he @, unto him his disciples, and @
 unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than
all they @ have cast into the treasury: 12:44 For all they did
cast in of @ abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that
she had, even all her living.

13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples @
 unto
him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
13:2 And @ answering said unto him, Seest thou @ @
buildings?  @ @ not be left one stone upon @F, that @
not be thrown down.

13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over @
 the temple,
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 13:4 Tell us,
when @ @ @ be? and what @ be the sign when all @
@ @ be fulfilled?  13:5 And @ answering them began to
say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 13:6 For many @ come in
my name, @, I am @2; and @ deceive many.

13:7 And when ye @ hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
troubled: for such @ must needs be; but the end @ not be yet.

13:8 For nation @ rise @
 nation, and kingdom @

kingdom: and @ @ be @quakes in divers @'s, and @
@ be famines and troubles: @ are the beginnings of sorrows.

13:9 But take heed to yourselves: for they @ deliver you up to
councils; and in the synagogues ye @ be beaten: and ye @ be
@ @	 rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony @

them.

13:10 And the gospel must @O be published @ all nations.

13:11 But when they @ lead you, and deliver you up, take no
thought @	hand what ye @ @K, @" do ye premeditate: but
whatsoever @ be @= you in that hour, that @K ye: for it is
not ye that @K, but the Holy Ghost.

13:12 Now the @X @ betray the @X to @^, and the
@ the son; and @ @ rise up @
 @ parents, and
@ cause them to be put to @^.

13:13 And ye @ be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that
@ endure unto the end, the same @ be saved.

13:14 But when ye @ see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that
readeth @[stand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the
mountains: 13:15 And let him that is on the @top not go down into
the @, @" enter @in, to take any @7 out of his @:
13:16 And let him that is in the field not turn back @* for to take
up his garment.

13:17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck
in @J days!  13:18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter.

13:19 For in @J days @ be affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation @ God created unto this time, @"
@ be.

13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened @J days, no @R
@# be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he
hath shortened the days.

13:21 And then if any man @ say to you, Lo, here is @2; or,
lo, he is @; believe him not: 13:22 For false @2s and false
prophets @ rise, and @ shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if
it were possible, even the elect.

13:23 But take ye heed: @%, I have foretold you all @.

13:24 But in @J days, @ that tribulation, the sun @ be
darkened, and the moon @ not give her light, 13:25 And the stars
of @1 @ fall, and the powers that are in @1 @ be
shaken.

13:26 And then @ they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
@ power and @Y.

13:27 And then @ he send his angels, and @ gather @? his
elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the @ to the
uttermost part of @1.

13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
tender, and putteth @ leaves, ye know that summer is near: 13:29
So ye in like manner, when ye @ see @ @ come to pass,
know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation @ not pass, till
all @ @ be done.

13:31 Heaven and @ @ pass away: but my @5 @ not pass
away.

13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
@ are in @1, @" the Son, but the Father.

13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
his @, and gave authority to his @<s, and to @ man his
work, and @M the porter to watch.

13:35 Watch ye @fore: for ye know not when the master of the @
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the
morning: 13:36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

13:37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
@d: and the chief @6s and the scribes sought how they @B
take him by craft, and put him to @^.

14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest @ be an uproar of
the @.

14:3 And being in Bethany in the @ of Simon the leper, as he sat
at meat, @ came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his
head.

14:4 And @ were some that had indignation within @T, and
said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?  14:5 For it @B have
been sold for more than @@ @/ pence, and have been @= to
the poor. And they murmured @
 her.

14:6 And @ said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
wrought a good work on me.

14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good: but me ye have not always.

14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
body to the burying.

14:9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel @ be preached
@Eout the whole world, this also that she hath done @ be
spoken of for a memorial of her.

14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
@6s, to betray him unto them.

14:11 And when they @) it, they were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought how he @B conveniently betray him.

14:12 And the @O day of unleavened @d, when they killed the
passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and
prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  14:13 And he sendeth @
two of his disciples, and @
 unto them, Go ye into the city, and
@ @ meet you a man bearing a pitcher of @Z: follow him.

14:14 And wheresoever he @ go in, say ye to the goodman of the
@, The Master @
, Where is the guestchamber, where I @ eat
the passover with my disciples?  14:15 And he will shew you a large
upper room furnished and prepared: @ make ready for us.

14:16 And his disciples went @, and came into the city, and @V
as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

14:17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

14:18 And as they sat and did eat, @ said, Verily I say unto you,
One of you @ eateth with me @ betray me.

14:19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
Is it I? and @F said, Is it I?  14:20 And he @> and said
unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.

14:21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man
if he had never been born.

14:22 And as they did eat, @ took @d, and blessed, and brake
it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had @= thanks, he gave it to
them: and they all drank of it.

14:24 And he said unto them, This is my @I of the new testament,
@ is shed for many.

14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will @b no more of the fruit of the
vine, until that day that I @b it new in the kingdom of God.

14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.

14:27 And @ @
 unto them, All ye @ be offended @ of
me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep @ be scattered.

14:28 But @ that I am risen, I will go @	 you into Galilee.

14:29 But Peter said unto him, Although all @ be offended, yet
will not I.

14:30 And @ @
 unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
even in this night, @	 the cock crow twice, thou @ deny me
thrice.

14:31 But he @0 the more vehemently, If I @# die with thee, I
will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

14:32 And they came to a @' @ was named Gethsemane: and he
@
 to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I @ pray.

14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 14:34 And @
 unto them, My soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto @^: tarry ye here, and watch.

14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
that, if it were possible, the hour @B pass from him.

14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all @ are possible unto thee;
take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what
thou wilt.

14:37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and @
 unto Peter,
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  14:38 Watch
ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
but the @R is weak.

14:39 And @* he went away, and prayed, and @0 the same @5.

14:40 And when he returned, he @V them asleep @*, (for @
eyes were heavy,) @" wist they what to answer him.

14:41 And he cometh the third time, and @
 unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; @%, the Son of
man is betrayed into the @D of sinners.

14:42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

14:43 And immediately, while he yet @0, cometh Judas, one of the
twelve, and with him a @ multitude with @Qs and staves, from
the chief @6s and the scribes and the elders.

14:44 And he that betrayed him had @= them a token, @,
Whomsoever I @ kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away
safely.

14:45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
@
, Master, master; and kissed him.

14:46 And they laid @ @D on him, and took him.

14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a @Q, and smote a @<
of the high @6, and cut off his ear.

14:48 And @ @> and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
@
 a thief, with @Qs and with staves to take me?  14:49 I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the
scriptures must be fulfilled.

14:50 And they all forsook him, and fled.

14:51 And @ followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
cast @+ his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 14:52
And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

14:53 And they led @ away to the high @6: and with him were
assembled all the chief @6s and the elders and the scribes.

14:54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
high @6: and he sat with the @<s, and warmed @9 at the
fire.

14:55 And the chief @6s and all the council sought for witness
@
 @ to put him to @^; and @V none.

14:56 For many bare false witness @
 him, but @ witness
agreed not @?.

14:57 And @ arose certain, and bare false witness @
 him,
@, 14:58 We @) him say, I will destroy this temple that is
made with @D, and within @@ days I will build @F made
@S @D.

14:59 But @" so did @ witness agree @?.

14:60 And the high @6 stood up in the @a, and asked @,
@, Answerest thou no@7? what is it @ @ witness @

thee?  14:61 But he held his @U, and @> no@7. Again the
high @6 asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the @2, the Son
of the Blessed?  14:62 And @ said, I am: and ye @ see the Son
of man sitting on the @c hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
@1.

14:63 Then the high @6 rent his clothes, and @
, What need we
any further witnesses?  14:64 Ye have @) the blasphemy: what think
ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of @^.

14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the @<s did strike
him with the palms of @ @D.

14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, @ cometh one of the
maids of the high @6: 14:67 And when she saw Peter warming
@9, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with @
of Nazareth.

14:68 But he denied, @, I know not, @" @[stand I what
thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

14:69 And a maid saw him @*, and began to say to them that stood
by, This is one of them.

14:70 And he denied it @*. And a little @, they that stood by
said @* to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a
Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth @to.

14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, @, I know not this man
of whom ye @K.

14:72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter @, to mind the
word that @ said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou @
deny me thrice. And when he thought @on, he wept.

15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief @6s held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and
bound @, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

15:3 And the chief @6s accused him of many @: but he @>
no@7.

15:4 And Pilate asked him @*, @, Answerest thou no@7?
@% how many @ they witness @
 thee.

15:5 But @ yet @> no@7; so that Pilate marvelled.

15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
they desired.

15:7 And @ was one named Barabbas, @ lay bound with them that
had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the
insurrection.

15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
had ever done unto them.

15:9 But Pilate @> them, @, Will ye that I release unto you
the King of the Jews?  15:10 For he knew that the chief @6s had
delivered him for envy.

15:11 But the chief @6s moved the @, that he @# rather
release Barabbas unto them.

15:12 And Pilate @> and said @* unto them, What will ye then
that I @ do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?  15:13 And
they cried out @*, Crucify him.

15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the @, released Barabbas
unto them, and delivered @, when he had scourged him, to be
crucified.

15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, @, Praetorium;
and they call @? the whole band.

15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
and put it @+ his head, 15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King
of the Jews!  15:19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and
did spit upon him, and bowing @ knees worshipped him.

15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
of the country, the @ of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

15:22 And they @( him unto the @' Golgotha, @ is, being
interpreted, The @' of a skull.

15:23 And they gave him to @b wine mingled with myrrh: but he
received it not.

15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
casting lots upon them, what @ man @# take.

15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
KING OF THE JEWS.

15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his @c
hand, and the @C on his left.

15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, @ @
, And he was
numbered with the transgressors.

15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging @ heads, and
@, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in @@
days, 15:30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

15:31 Likewise also the chief @6s mocking said @ @T
with the scribes, He saved @Cs; @9 he cannot save.

15:32 Let @2 the King of @ descend now from the cross, that
we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled
him.

15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, @ was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.

15:34 And at the ninth hour @ cried with a loud @;, @,
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? @ is, being interpreted, My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?  15:35 And some of them that stood by,
when they @) it, said, @., he calleth Elias.

15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him to @b, @, Let alone; let us see whether
Elias will come to take him down.

15:37 And @ cried with a loud @;, and gave up the ghost.

15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.

15:39 And when the centurion, @ stood over @
 him, saw that
he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was
the Son of God.

15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: @ whom was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the m@C of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome; 15:41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
ministered unto him;) and many @C women @ came up with him unto
@ .

15:42 And now when the even was come, @ it was the preparation,
that is, the day @	 the sabbath, 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an
honourable counsellor, @ also waited for the kingdom of God, came,
and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of @.

15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
Joseph.

15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in
the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre @ was hewn out of a rock,
and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the m@C of Joses beheld where he
was laid.

16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
m@C of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they @B
come and anoint him.

16:2 And very early in the morning the @O day of the week, they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

16:3 And they said @ @T, Who @ roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre?  16:4 And when they looked, they saw
that the stone was rolled away: for it was very @.

16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on
the @c side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were
aff@ced.

16:6 And he @
 unto them, Be not aff@ced: Ye seek @ of
Nazareth, @ was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: @% the
@' where they laid him.

16:7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
@	 you into Galilee: @ @ ye see him, as he said unto you.

16:8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
trembled and were amazed: @" said they any @7 to any man; for
they were afraid.

16:9 Now when @ was risen early the @O day of the week, he
appeared @O to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast @H
devils.

16:10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
mourned and wept.

16:11 And they, when they had @) that he was alive, and had been
seen of her, believed not.

16:12 After that he appeared in @F form unto two of them, as they
walked, and went into the country.

16:13 And they went and told it unto the residue: @" believed
they them.

16:14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
upbraided them with @ unbelief and hardness of @, @ they
believed not them @ had seen him @ he was risen.

16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to @ creature.

16:16 He that believeth and is baptized @ be saved; but he that
believeth not @ be damned.

16:17 And @ signs @ follow them that believe; In my name @
they cast out devils; they @ @K with new tongues; 16:18 They
@ take up serpents; and if they @b any deadly @7, it @
not hurt them; they @ lay @D on the sick, and they @
recover.

16:19 So then @ the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up
into @1, and sat on the @c hand of God.

16:20 And they went @, and preached @ where, the Lord working
with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.




The Gospel According to Saint Luke


1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set @ in order a
declaration of @J @ @ are most surely believed @ us,
1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, @ from the beginning were
eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 1:3 It seemed good to me
also, having had perfect @[standing of all @ from the very
@O, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 1:4
That thou @Best know the certainty of @J @, wherein thou
hast been instructed.

1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
@6 named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

1:6 And they were both @ceous @	 God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

1:7 And they had no child, @ that Elisabeth was barren, and they
both were now well stricken in @8.

1:8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the @6's office
@	 God in the order of his course, 1:9 According to the custom of
the @6's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the
temple of the Lord.

1:10 And the whole multitude of the @ were praying @S at the
time of incense.

1:11 And @ appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
@c side of the @\ of incense.

1:12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him.

1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer
is @); and thy wife Elisabeth @ bear thee a son, and thou @
call his name John.

1:14 And thou @ have joy and gladness; and many @ rejoice at
his birth.

1:15 For he @ be @ in the sight of the Lord, and @ @b
@" wine nor strong @b; and he @ be filled with the Holy

1:16 And many of the @ of @ @ he turn to the Lord
@ God.

1:17 And he @ go @	 him in the spirit and power of Elias, to
turn the @s of the @s to the @, and the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just; to make ready a @ prepared for the Lord.

1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby @ I know this? for
I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in @8.

1:19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
in the presence of God; and am sent to @K unto thee, and to shew
thee @ glad tidings.

1:20 And, @%, thou @ be dumb, and not able to @K, until the
day that @ @ @ be performed, @ thou believest not
my @5, @ @ be fulfilled in @ season.

1:21 And the @ waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
tarried so long in the temple.

1:22 And when he came out, he could not @K unto them: and they
perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned
unto them, and remained speechless.

1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own @.

1:24 And @ @J days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
herself five months, @, 1:25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in
the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach @ men.

1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the @ of @; and the virgin's name
was Mary.

1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou @ women.

1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his @, and cast in
her mind what manner of salutation this @# be.

1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast @V

1:31 And, @%, thou @ conceive in thy womb, and @( @ a

1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How @ this be, seeing I know

1:36 And, @%, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son

barren.

1:37 For with God no@7 @ be impossible.

1:38 And Mary said, @. the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
@$ to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

1:39 And Mary arose in @J days, and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda; 1:40 And entered into the @ of
Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth @) the salutation of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost: 1:42 And she @0 out with a loud @;, and said,
Blessed art thou @ women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

1:43 And whence is this to me, that the m@C of my Lord @# come

1:45 And blessed is she that believed: for @ @ be a
performance of @J @ @ were told her from the Lord.

1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47 And my spirit
hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

1:48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
@%, from hence@ all generations @ call me blessed.

1:49 For he that is @By hath done to me @ @; and holy is

1:50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
generation.

1:51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud

1:52 He hath put down the @By from @ seats, and exalted them of
low degree.

1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good @; and the rich he hath
sent empty away.

1:54 He hath holpen his @< @, in remembrance of his mercy;
1:55 As he @0 to our @s, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

1:56 And Mary abode with her @+ @@ months, and returned to her

1:57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she @# be delivered; and
she @ @ a son.

1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins @) how the Lord had shewed
@ mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

1:59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child; and they @, him Zacharias, @ the name of

1:60 And his m@C @> and said, Not so; but he @ be @,

1:61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is

1:62 And they made signs to his @, how he @L have him @,.

1:63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, @, His name is
John. And they marvelled all.

1:64 And his @P was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
he @0, and praised God.

1:65 And fear came on all that dwelt round @+ them: and all @
@s were noised abroad @Eout all the hill country of Judaea.

1:66 And all they that @) them laid them up in @ @s,
@, What manner of child @ this be! And the hand of the Lord
was with him.

1:67 And his @ Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
prophesied, @, 1:68 Blessed be the Lord God of @; for he
hath visited and redeemed his @, 1:69 And hath raised up an horn

1:76 And thou, child, @ be @, the prophet of the Highest: for

darkness and in the shadow of @^, to guide our feet into the way of

1:80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
deserts till the day of his shewing unto @.

2:1 And it came to pass in @J days, that @ went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus that all the world @# be taxed.

2:2 (And this taxing was @O made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria.)  2:3 And all went to be taxed, @ one into his own city.

2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,

2:6 And so it was, that, while they were @, the days were

2:16 And they came with haste, and @V Mary, and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger.

2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the @
@ was told them concerning this child.

2:18 And all they that @) it wondered at @J @ @ were
told them by the shepherds.

2:19 But Mary kept all @ @, and pondered them in her @.

2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the @ that they had @) and seen, as it was told unto them.

2:21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the
child, his name was @, JESUS, @ was so named of the angel
@	 he was conceived in the womb.

2:22 And when the days of her purification @$ to the law of

2:25 And, @%, @ was a man in @ , whose name was Simeon;

2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he @#

2:27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
@ in the child @, to do for him @ the custom of the law,
2:28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 2:29
Lord, now lettest thou thy @< depart in @U, @$ to thy

2:33 And Joseph and his m@C marvelled at @J @ @ were

2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his m@C, @.,

2:36 And @ was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Aser: she was of a @ age, and had lived with an
husband @H @8 from her virginity; 2:37 And she was a widow of

but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

2:38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
Lord, and @0 of him to all them that looked for redemption in

2:39 And when they had performed all @ @$ to the law of
the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to @ own city Nazareth.

2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

2:41 Now his parents went to @  @ year at the feast of the
passover.

2:42 And when he was twelve @8 old, they went up to @  @
the custom of the feast.

2:43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child
@ tarried behind in @ ; and Joseph and his m@C knew not

2:44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
journey; and they sought him @ @ kinsfolk and acquaintance.

2:45 And when they @V him not, they turned back @* to @ ,
seeking him.

2:46 And it came to pass, that @ @@ days they @V him in the

asking them questions.

2:47 And all that @) him were astonished at his @[standing and

2:48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his m@C said unto
him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? @%, thy @ and I
have sought thee sorrowing.

2:49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not
that I must be @+ my Father's business?  2:50 And they @[stood
not the @ @ he @0 unto them.

2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject

2:52 And @ increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God

3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his @X Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 3:2 Annas and
Caiaphas being the high @6s, the word of God came unto John the
son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3:3 And he came into all the country @+ Jordan, preaching the
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 3:4 As it is written
in the book of the @5 of Esaias the prophet, @, The @; of
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
paths straight.

3:5 Every valley @ be filled, and @ mountain and hill @ be
@ low; and the crooked @ be made straight, and the rough
ways @ be made smooth; 3:6 And all @R @ see the salvation

3:7 Then said he to the multitude that came @ to be baptized of
him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come?  3:8 Bring @ @fore fruits worthy of repentance,
and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our @:
for I say unto you, That God is able of @ stones to raise up
@ unto Abraham.

3:9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: @
tree @fore @ @(eth not @ good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

3:10 And the @ asked him, @, What @ we do then?  3:11 He
answereth and @
 unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart
to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.

3:12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
Master, what @ we do?  3:13 And he said unto them, Exact no more
than that @ is appointed you.

3:14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, @, And what @
we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, @" accuse
any falsely; and be content with your wages.

3:15 And as the @ were in expectation, and all men mused in @
@s of John, whether he were the @2, or not; 3:16 John
@>, @ unto them all, I indeed baptize you with @Z; but
one @Bier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to unloose: he @ baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:
3:17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will @Ely purge his floor,
and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable.

3:18 And many @C @ in his exhortation preached he unto the

3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
@X Philip's wife, and for all the evils @ Herod had done,
3:20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

3:21 Now when all the @ were baptized, it came to pass, that
@ also being baptized, and praying, the @1 was opened, 3:22
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,

4:1 And @ being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 4:2 Being forty days
tempted of the devil. And in @J days he did eat no@7: and when
they were ended, he @ward hungered.

4:3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command
this stone that it be made @d.

4:4 And @ @> him, @, It is written, That man @ not

4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto
him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

4:6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and
the @Y of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I
will I give it.

4:7 If thou @fore wilt worship me, all @ be @.

4:8 And @ @> and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:
for it is written, Thou @ worship the Lord thy God, and him only
@ thou serve.

4:9 And he @ him to @ , and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
down from hence: 4:10 For it is written, He @ give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee: 4:11 And in @ @D they @
bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot @
 a stone.

4:12 And @ answering said unto him, It is said, Thou @ not
tempt the Lord thy God.

4:13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from
him for a season.

4:14 And @ returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and
@ went out a fame of him @E all the region round @+.

4:15 And he taught in @ synagogues, being glorified of all.

4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been @ up: and, as
his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
stood up for to read.

4:17 And @ was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
And when he had opened the book, he @V the @' where it was
written, 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, @ he hath
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal
the broken@ed, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
bruised, 4:19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

4:20 And he closed the book, and he gave it @* to the minister, and
sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him.

4:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears.

4:22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious @5
@ proceeded out of his @P. And they said, Is not this Joseph's
son?  4:23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have @) done in
Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

4:24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his
own country.

4:25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in @ in the days
of Elias, when the @1 was shut up @@ @8 and six months, when
@ famine was @Eout all the land; 4:26 But unto none of them
was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that
was a widow.

4:27 And many lepers were in @ in the time of Eliseus the
prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.

4:28 And all they in the synagogue, when they @) @ @, were
filled with wrath, 4:29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,
and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon @ city was built,
that they @B cast him down headlong.

4:30 But he passing @E the @a of them went his way, 4:31 And
came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the
sabbath days.

4:32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with
power.

4:33 And in the synagogue @ was a man, @ had a spirit of an
unclean devil, and cried out with a loud @;, 4:34 Saying, Let us
alone; what have we to do with thee, thou @ of Nazareth? art thou
come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

4:35 And @ rebuked him, @, Hold thy @U, and come out of
him.

And when the devil had thrown him in the @a, he came out of him,
and hurt him not.

4:36 And they were all amazed, and @0 @ @T, @,
What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the
unclean spirits, and they come out.

4:37 And the fame of him went out into @ @' of the country
round @+.

4:38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
@.

And Simon's wife's m@C was taken with a @ fever; and they
besought him for her.

4:39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

4:40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
divers diseases @ them unto him; and he laid his @D on @
one of them, and healed them.

4:41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and @, Thou
art @2 the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to
@K: for they knew that he was @2.

4:42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert @':
and the @ sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he
@# not depart from them.

4:43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to @C
@G also: for @fore am I sent.

4:44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

5:1 And it came to pass, that, as the @ pressed upon him to hear
the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 5:2 And saw two
ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them,
and were washing @ nets.

5:3 And he entered into one of the ships, @ was Simon's, and
prayed him that he @L thrust out a little from the land. And he sat
down, and taught the @ out of the ship.

5:4 Now when he had left @King, he said unto Simon, Launch out into
the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

5:5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the
night, and have taken no@7: nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net.

5:6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a @ multitude of
fishes: and @ net brake.

5:7 And they beckoned unto @ partners, @ were in the @C
ship, that they @# come and help them. And they came, and filled
both the ships, so that they began to sink.

5:8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at @' knees, @,
Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

5:9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes @ they had taken: 5:10 And so was also James, and
John, the sons of Zebedee, @ were partners with Simon. And @
said unto Simon, Fear not; from hence@ thou @ catch men.

5:11 And when they had @ @ ships to land, they forsook all,
and followed him.

5:12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, @% a man
full of leprosy: who seeing @ fell on his face, and besought him,
@, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

5:13 And he put @ his hand, and touched him, @, I will: be
thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

5:14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
the @6, and offer for thy cleansing, @$ as @ @M,
for a testimony unto them.

5:15 But so much the more went @ a fame abroad of him: and @
multitudes came @? to hear, and to be healed by him of @
infirmities.

5:16 And he withdrew @9 into the wilderness, and prayed.

5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
@ were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, @ were
come out of @ town of Galilee, and Judaea, and @ : and the
power of the Lord was present to heal them.

5:18 And, @%, men @ in a bed a man @ was taken with a
palsy: and they sought means to @( him in, and to lay him @	
him.

5:19 And when they could not find by what way they @B @( him in
@ of the multitude, they went upon the @top, and let him
down @E the tiling with his couch into the @a @	 @.

5:20 And when he saw @ faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
for@= thee.

5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, @, Who is
this @ @Keth blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
5:22 But when @ perceived @ thoughts, he answering said unto
them, What reason ye in your @s?  5:23 Whether is easier, to say,
Thy sins be for@= thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?  5:24 But that
ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon @ to forgive sins,
(he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take
up thy couch, and go into @ @.

5:25 And immediately he rose up @	 them, and took up that whereon
he lay, and departed to his own @, glorifying God.

5:26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled
with fear, @, We have seen strange @ to day.

5:27 And @ @ @ he went @, and saw a publican, named
Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow
me.

5:28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

5:29 And Levi made him a @ feast in his own @: and @ was a
@ company of publicans and of @Cs that sat down with them.

5:30 But @ scribes and Pharisees murmured @
 his disciples,
@, Why do ye eat and @b with publicans and sinners?  5:31 And
@ answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a
physician; but they that are sick.

5:32 I came not to call the @ceous, but sinners to repentance.

5:33 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,
and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but
@ eat and @b?  5:34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the
@ of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
5:35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom @ be taken away
from them, and then @ they fast in @J days.

5:36 And he @0 also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of
a new garment upon an old; if @Cwise, then both the new maketh a
rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the
old.

5:37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine
will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles @ perish.

5:38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
preserved.

5:39 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for
he @
, The old is better.

6:1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath @ the @O, that he
went @E the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of
corn, and did eat, rubbing them in @ @D.

6:2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that @
is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?  6:3 And @ answering them
said, Have ye not read so much as this, what @ did, when @9
was an hungred, and they @ were with him; 6:4 How he went into the
@ of God, and did take and eat the shew@d, and gave also to
them that were with him; @ it is not lawful to eat but for the
@6s alone?  6:5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord
also of the sabbath.

6:6 And it came to pass also on @F sabbath, that he entered into
the synagogue and taught: and @ was a man whose @c hand was
wi@d.

6:7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he @L heal
on the sabbath day; that they @B find an accusation @
 him.

6:8 But he knew @ thoughts, and said to the man @ had the
wi@d hand, Rise up, and stand @ in the @a. And he arose and
stood @.

6:9 Then said @ unto them, I will ask you one @7; Is it lawful
on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to
destroy it?  6:10 And looking round @+ upon them all, he said unto
the man, Stretch @ thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
restored whole as the @C.

6:11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with @F
what they @B do to @.

6:12 And it came to pass in @J days, that he went out into a
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

6:13 And when it was day, he @, unto him his disciples: and of
them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 6:14 Simon, (whom
he also named Peter,) and Andrew his @X, James and John, Philip
and Bartholomew, 6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
and Simon @, Zelotes, 6:16 And Judas the @X of James, and
Judas Iscariot, @ also was the traitor.

6:17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
company of his disciples, and a @ multitude of @ out of all
Judaea and @ , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, @
came to hear him, and to be healed of @ diseases; 6:18 And they
that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.

6:19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for @ went
virtue out of him, and healed them all.

6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye @ be filled. Blessed
are ye that weep now: for ye @ laugh.

6:22 Blessed are ye, when men @ hate you, and when they @
separate you from @ company, and @ reproach you, and cast out
your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, @%, your
reward is @ in @1: for in the like manner did @ @s
unto the prophets.

6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your

6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye @ hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye @ mourn and weep.

6:26 Woe unto you, when all men @ @K well of you! for so did
@ @s to the false prophets.

6:27 But I say unto you @ hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
@ hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them
@ despitefully use you.

6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
@C; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat
also.

6:30 Give to @ man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh

6:31 And as ye @L that men @# do to you, do ye also to them

6:32 For if ye love them @ love you, what thank have ye? for
sinners also love @J that love them.

6:33 And if ye do good to them @ do good to you, what thank have
ye?  for sinners also do even the same.

6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much @*.

6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
no@7 @*; and your reward @ be @, and ye @ be the
@ of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the
evil.

6:36 Be ye @fore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

6:37 Judge not, and ye @ not be judged: condemn not, and ye @
not be condemned: forgive, and ye @ be for@=: 6:38 Give, and it
@ be @= unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken
@?, and running over, @ men give into your bosom. For with
the same measure that ye mete withal it @ be measured to you

6:39 And he @0 a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
@ they not both fall into the ditch?  6:40 The disciple is not
above his master: but @ one that is perfect @ be as his
master.

6:41 And why @%est thou the mote that is in thy @X's eye, but
perceivest not the beam that is in @ own eye?  6:42 Either how
canst thou say to thy @X, Br@C, let me pull out the mote that
is in @ eye, when thou thyself @%est not the beam that is in
@ own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out @O the beam out of @
own eye, and then @ thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is
in thy @X's eye.

6:43 For a good tree @(eth not @ corrupt fruit; @" doth a
corrupt tree @( @ good fruit.

6:44 For @ tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his @ @(eth @
that @ is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his
@ @(eth @ that @ is evil: for of the abundance of the
@ his @P @Keth.

6:46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the @ @ I
say?  6:47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my @s, and doeth
them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 6:48 He is like a man @
built an @, and digged deep, and laid the @Vation on a rock:
and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that @,
and could not shake it: for it was @Ved upon a rock.

6:49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that @S a
@Vation built an @ upon the @; @
 @ the stream did
beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that @
was @.

7:1 Now when he had ended all his @s in the audience of the
@, he entered into Capernaum.

7:2 And a certain centurion's @<, who was dear unto him, was
sick, and ready to die.

7:3 And when he @) of @, he sent unto him the elders of the
Jews, beseeching him that he @L come and heal his @<.

7:4 And when they came to @, they besought him instantly, @,
That he was worthy for whom he @# do this: 7:5 For he loveth our
nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

7:6 Then @ went with them. And when he was now not far from the
@, the centurion sent friends to him, @ unto him, Lord,
trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou @#est enter
@[ my roof: 7:7 Wherefore @" thought I myself worthy to come
unto thee: but say in a word, and my @< @ be healed.

7:8 For I also am a man set @[ authority, having @[ me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to @F, Come, and he
cometh; and to my @<, Do this, and he doeth it.

7:9 When @ @) @ @, he marvelled at him, and turned him
@+, and said unto the @ that followed him, I say unto you, I
have not @V so @ faith, no, not in @.

7:10 And they that were sent, returning to the @, @V the
@< whole that had been sick.

7:11 And it came to pass the day @, that he went into a city
@, Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much @.

7:12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, @%, @ was
a dead man carried out, the only son of his m@C, and she was a
widow: and much @ of the city was with her.

7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
unto her, Weep not.

7:14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
still.

And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

7:15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to @K. And he delivered
him to his m@C.

7:16 And @ came a fear on all: and they glorified God, @,
That a @ prophet is risen up @ us; and, That God hath visited
his @.

7:17 And this rumour of him went @ @Eout all Judaea, and
@Eout all the region round @+.

7:18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all @ @.

7:19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
@, @, Art thou he that @# come? or look we for @F?
7:20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
sent us unto thee, @, Art thou he that @# come? or look we
for @F?  7:21 And in that same hour he cured many of @
infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were
blind he gave sight.

7:22 Then @ answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
what @ ye have seen and @); how that the blind see, the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to
the poor the gospel is preached.

7:23 And blessed is he, whosoever @ not be offended in me.

7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to @K
unto the @ concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness
for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?  7:25 But what went ye out
for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  @., they @ are
gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.

7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,
and much more than a prophet.

7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, @., I send my messenger
@	 thy face, @ @ prepare thy way @	 thee.

7:28 For I say unto you, Among @J that are born of women @ is
not a @er prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in
the kingdom of God is @er than he.

7:29 And all the @ that @) him, and the publicans, justified
God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God @

@T, being not baptized of him.

7:31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then @ I liken the men of this
generation? and to what are they like?  7:32 They are like unto
@ sitting in the market@', and calling one to @F, and
@, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

7:33 For John the Baptist came @" eating @d nor @bing wine;
and ye say, He hath a devil.

7:34 The Son of man is come eating and @bing; and ye say, @. a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her @.

7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he @L eat with him.
And he went into the Pharisee's @, and sat down to meat.

7:37 And, @%, a woman in the city, @ was a sinner, when she
knew that @ sat at meat in the Pharisee's @, @ an
alabaster box of ointment, 7:38 And stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment.

7:39 Now when the Pharisee @ had bidden him saw it, he @0
within @9, @, This man, if he were a prophet, @L have
known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she
is a sinner.

7:40 And @ answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee. And he @
, Master, say on.

7:41 There was a certain creditor @ had two debtors: the one owed
five @/ pence, and the @C fifty.

7:42 And when they had no@7 to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
Tell me @fore, @ of them will love him most?  7:43 Simon
@> and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.

And he said unto him, Thou hast @cly judged.

7:44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
woman? I entered into @ @, thou gavest me no @Z for my
feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the
hairs of her head.

7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in
hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
anointed my feet with ointment.

7:47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, @ are many, are
for@=; for she loved much: but to whom little is for@=, the same
loveth little.

7:48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are for@=.

7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
@T, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  7:50 And he said to
the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in @U.

8:1 And it came to pass @ward, that he went @Eout @ city
and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of
God: and the twelve were with him, 8:2 And certain women, @ had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary @, Magdalene,
out of whom went @H devils, 8:3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza
Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many @Cs, @ ministered unto
him of @ substance.

8:4 And when much @ were ga@d @?, and were come to him
out of @ city, he @0 by a parable: 8:5 A sower went out to sow
his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was
trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

8:6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
wi@d away, @ it lacked moisture.

8:7 And some fell @ thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it.

8:8 And @C fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
@/fold. And when he had said @ @, he cried, He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear.

8:9 And his disciples asked him, @, What @B this parable be?
8:10 And he said, Unto you it is @= to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God: but to @Cs in parables; that seeing they @B not
see, and hearing they @B not @[stand.

8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

8:12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,
and taketh away the word out of @ @s, lest they @# believe
and be saved.

8:13 They on the rock are they, @, when they hear, receive the
word with joy; and @ have no root, @ for a while believe, and
in time of temptation fall away.

8:14 And that @ fell @ thorns are they, @, when they have
@), go @, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of
this life, and @( no fruit to perfection.

8:15 But that on the good ground are they, @ in an honest and good
@, having @) the word, keep it, and @( @ fruit with
patience.

8:16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
or putteth it @[ a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they
@ enter in may see the light.

8:17 For no@7 is secret, that @ not be made manifest; @"
any @7 hid, that @ not be known and come abroad.

8:18 Take heed @fore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him @
be @=; and whosoever hath not, from him @ be taken even that
@ he seemeth to have.

8:19 Then came to him his m@C and his @3, and could not come
at him for the press.

8:20 And it was told him by certain @ said, Thy m@C and thy
@3 stand @S, desiring to see thee.

8:21 And he @> and said unto them, My m@C and my @3 are
@ @ hear the word of God, and do it.

8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the
@C side of the lake. And they launched @.

8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and @ came down a storm of
wind on the lake; and they were filled with @Z, and were in
jeopardy.

8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, @, Master, master, we
perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the
@Z: and they ceased, and @ was a calm.

8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid
wondered, @ one to @F, What manner of man is this! for he
commandeth even the winds and @Z, and they obey him.

8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, @ is over
@
 Galilee.

8:27 And when he went @ to land, @ met him out of the city a
certain man, @ had devils long time, and ware no clothes, @"
abode in any @, but in the tombs.

8:28 When he saw @, he cried out, and fell down @	 him, and
with a loud @; said, What have I to do with thee, @, thou Son
of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

8:29 (For he had @M the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains
and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil
into the wilderness.)  8:30 And @ asked him, @, What is thy
name? And he said, Legion: @ many devils were entered into him.

8:31 And they besought him that he @L not command them to go out
into the deep.

8:32 And @ was @ an herd of many swine feeding on the
mountain: and they besought him that he @L suffer them to enter
into them. And he suffered them.

8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:
and the herd ran violently down a steep @' into the lake, and were
choked.

8:34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
and told it in the city and in the country.

8:35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to @, and
@V the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the
feet of @, clothed, and in his @c mind: and they were afraid.

8:36 They also @ saw it told them by what means he that was
possessed of the devils was healed.

8:37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
@+ besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with @
fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back @*.

8:38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
that he @B be with him: but @ sent him away, @, 8:39
Return to @ own @, and shew how @ @ God hath done
unto thee. And he went his way, and published @Eout the whole
city how @ @ @ had done unto him.

8:40 And it came to pass, that, when @ was returned, the @
gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

8:41 And, @%, @ came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of
the synagogue: and he fell down at @' feet, and besought him that
he @L come into his @: 8:42 For he had one only daughter, @+
twelve @8 of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the @
thronged him.

8:43 And a woman having an issue of @I twelve @8, @ had
spent all her living upon physicians, @" could be healed of any,
8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
immediately her issue of @I stanched.

8:45 And @ said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they
that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  8:46 And @ said, Somebody
hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,
and falling down @	 him, she declared unto him @	 all the
@ for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed
immediately.

8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
hath made thee whole; go in @U.

8:49 While he yet @0, @ cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogue's @, @ to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not
the Master.

8:50 But when @ @) it, he @> him, @, Fear not:
believe only, and she @ be made whole.

8:51 And when he came into the @, he suffered no man to go in,
save Peter, and James, and John, and the @ and the m@C of the
maiden.

8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not
dead, but sleepeth.

8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and @,,
@, Maid, arise.

8:55 And her spirit came @*, and she arose straightway: and he
@M to give her meat.

8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
@# tell no man what was done.

9:1 Then he @, his twelve disciples @?, and gave them power
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

9:2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
sick.

9:3 And he said unto them, Take no@7 for your journey, @"
staves, nor scrip, @" @d, @" money; @" have two
coats apiece.

9:4 And whatsoever @ ye enter into, @ abide, and thence
depart.

9:5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony @
 them.

9:6 And they departed, and went @E the towns, preaching the
gospel, and healing @ where.

9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch @) of all that was done by him: and he
was perplexed, @ that it was said of some, that John was risen
from the dead; 9:8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of
@Cs, that one of the old prophets was risen @*.

9:9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I
hear such @? And he desired to see him.

9:10 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they
had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert
@' belonging to the city @, Bethsaida.

9:11 And the @, when they knew it, followed him: and he received
them, and @0 unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that
had need of healing.

9:12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the
towns and country round @+, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are
here in a desert @'.

9:13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we @# go and
buy meat for all this @.

9:14 For they were @+ five @: men. And he said to his
disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

9:16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up
to @1, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to
set @	 the multitude.

9:17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and @ was taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

9:18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were
with him: and he asked them, @, Whom say the @ that I am?
9:19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
@Cs say, that one of the old prophets is risen @*.

9:20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
said, The @2 of God.

9:21 And he straitly charged them, and @M them to tell no man
that @7; 9:22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many @, and
be rejected of the elders and chief @6s and scribes, and be slain,
and be raised the third day.

9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come @ me, let him
deny @9, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

9:24 For whosoever will save his life @ lose it: but whosoever
will lose his life for my sake, the same @ save it.

9:25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
lose @9, or be cast away?  9:26 For whosoever @ be ashamed of
me and of my @5, of him @ the Son of man be ashamed, when he
@ come in his own @Y, and in his Father's, and of the holy
angels.

9:27 But I tell you of a truth, @ be some standing here, @
@ not taste of @^, till they see the kingdom of God.

9:28 And it came to pass @+ an eight days @ @ @s, he
took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and
his raiment was white and glistering.

9:30 And, @%, @ talked with him two men, @ were @ and
Elias: 9:31 Who appeared in @Y, and @0 of his decease @ he
@# accomplish at @ .

9:32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and
when they were awake, they saw his @Y, and the two men that stood
with him.

9:33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
@, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make @@
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for @, and one for Elias: not
knowing what he said.

9:34 While he thus @0, @ came a cloud, and overshadowed them:
and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

9:35 And @ came a @; out of the cloud, @, This is my
beloved Son: hear him.

9:36 And when the @; was past, @ was @V alone. And they kept
it close, and told no man in @J days any of @J @ @ they
had seen.

9:37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
down from the hill, much @ met him.

9:38 And, @%, a man of the company cried out, @, Master, I
beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

9:39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
teareth him that he foameth @*, and bruising him hardly departeth
from him.

9:40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

9:41 And @ answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
how long @ I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

9:42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
him.

And @ rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and
delivered him @* to his @.

9:43 And they were all amazed at the @By power of God. But while
they wondered @ one at all @ @ @ did, he said unto
his disciples, 9:44 Let @ @s sink down into your ears: for
the Son of man @ be delivered into the @D of men.

9:45 But they @[stood not this @, and it was hid from them,
that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that @.

9:46 Then @ arose a reasoning @ them, @ of them @# be
@est.

9:47 And @, perceiving the thought of @ @, took a child,
and set him by him, 9:48 And said unto them, Whosoever @ receive
this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever @ receive me
receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least @ you all, the
same @ be @.

9:49 And John @> and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils
in thy name; and we forbad him, @ he followeth not with us.

9:50 And @ said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
@
 us is for us.

9:51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he @# be
received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to @ , 9:52 And
sent messengers @	 his face: and they went, and entered into a
village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

9:53 And they did not receive him, @ his face was as though he
@L go to @ .

9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from @1, and consume
them, even as Elias did?  9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and
said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
save them. And they went to @F village.

9:57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man
said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

9:58 And @ said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

9:59 And he said unto @F, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
@O to go and bury my @.

9:60 @ said unto him, Let the dead bury @ dead: but go thou
and preach the kingdom of God.

9:61 And @F also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me @O
go bid them farewell, @ are at home at my @.

9:62 And @ said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

10:1 After @ @ the LORD appointed @C @Hty also, and
sent them two and two @	 his face into @ city and @',
whither he @9 @L come.

10:2 @N said he unto them, The harvest truly is @, but the
labourers are few: pray ye @fore the Lord of the harvest, that he
@L send @ labourers into his harvest.

10:3 Go your ways: @%, I send you @ as lambs @ wolves.

10:4 Carry @" purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by
the way.

10:5 And into whatsoever @ ye enter, @O say, Peace be to this
@.

10:6 And if the son of @U be @, your @U @ rest upon it:
if not, it @ turn to you @*.

10:7 And in the same @ remain, eating and @bing such @ as
they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from @
to @.

10:8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
@ as are set @	 you: 10:9 And heal the sick that are @in,
and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

10:10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 10:11 Even the
very dust of your city, @ cleaveth on us, we do wipe off @

you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is
come nigh unto you.

10:12 But I say unto you, that it @ be more tolerable in that day
for Sodom, than for that city.

10:13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
@By works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, @ have been done in
you, they had a @ while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and
ashes.

10:14 But it @ be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
judgment, than for you.

10:15 And thou, Capernaum, @ art exalted to @1, @ be
thrust down to hell.

10:16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

10:17 And the @Hty returned @* with joy, @, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us @E thy name.

10:18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
@1.

10:19 @., I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and no@7 @ by
any means hurt you.

10:20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
subject unto you; but rather rejoice, @ your names are written
in @1.

10:21 In that hour @ rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of @1 and @, that thou hast hid @ @ from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so,
Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

10:22 All @ are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,
and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

10:23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
Blessed are the eyes @ see the @ that ye see: 10:24 For I
tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see @J
@ @ ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear @J @
@ ye hear, and have not @) them.

10:25 And, @%, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, @,
Master, what @ I do to inherit eternal life?  10:26 He said unto
him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?  10:27 And he
answering said, Thou @ love the Lord thy God with all thy @,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

10:28 And he said unto him, Thou hast @> @c: this do, and
thou @ live.

10:29 But he, willing to justify @9, said unto @, And who is
my neighbour?  10:30 And @ answering said, A certain man went down
from @  to Jericho, and fell @ thieves, @ stripped him
of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

10:31 And by chance @ came down a certain @6 that way: and
when he saw him, he passed by on the @C side.

10:32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the @', came and looked
on him, and passed by on the @C side.

10:33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 10:34 And went to him, and
bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own
beast, and @ him to an inn, and took care of him.

10:35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and
whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come @*, I will repay thee.

10:36 Which now of @ @@, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him
that fell @ the thieves?  10:37 And he said, He that shewed mercy
on him. Then said @ unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

10:38 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into
her @.

10:39 And she had a sister @, Mary, @ also sat at @' feet,
and @) his word.

10:40 But Martha was cumbered @+ much serving, and came to him, and
said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
alone?  bid her @fore that she help me.

10:41 And @ @> and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
careful and troubled @+ many @: 10:42 But one @7 is
needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, @ @ not be taken
away from her.

11:1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain @',
when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to
pray, as John also taught his disciples.

11:2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father @ art in
@1, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as
in @1, so in @.

11:3 Give us day by day our daily @d.

11:4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive @ one that is
indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
evil.

11:5 And he said unto them, Which of you @ have a friend, and
@ go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me @@
loaves; 11:6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I
have no@7 to set @	 him?  11:7 And he from within @ answer
and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my @ are
with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

11:8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, @ he
is his friend, yet @ of his importunity he will rise and give
him as many as he needeth.

11:9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it @ be @= you; seek, and ye
@ find; knock, and it @ be opened unto you.

11:10 For @ one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it @ be opened.

11:11 If a son @ ask @d of any of you that is a @, will he
give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a
serpent?  11:12 Or if he @ ask an egg, will he offer him a
scorpion?  11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your @: how much more @ your @1ly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask him?  11:14 And he was casting out a
devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone
out, the dumb @0; and the @ wondered.

11:15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils @E Beelzebub
the chief of the devils.

11:16 And @Cs, tempting him, sought of him a sign from @1.

11:17 But he, knowing @ thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
divided @
 itself is @ to desolation; and a @ divided
@
 a @ falleth.

11:18 If Satan also be divided @
 @9, how @ his kingdom
stand? @ ye say that I cast out devils @E Beelzebub.

11:19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
them out? @fore @ they be your judges.

11:20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you.

11:21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
@U: 11:22 But when a stronger than he @ come upon him, and
overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted,
and divideth his spoils.

11:23 He that is not with me is @
 me: and he that ga@th not
with me scattereth.

11:24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh @E
dry @'s, seeking rest; and finding none, he @
, I will return
unto my @ whence I came out.

11:25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

11:26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him @H @C spirits more wicked
than @9; and they enter in, and dwell @: and the last state
of that man is worse than the @O.

11:27 And it came to pass, as he @0 @ @, a certain woman
of the company lifted up her @;, and said unto him, Blessed is the
womb that bare thee, and the paps @ thou hast sucked.

11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
God, and keep it.

11:29 And when the @ were ga@d thick @?, he began to
say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and @ @ no
sign be @= it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

11:30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so @ also the
Son of man be to this generation.

11:31 The queen of the south @ rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost
parts of the @ to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, @%, a
@er than Solomon is here.

11:32 The men of Nineve @ rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and @ condemn it: for they repented at the preaching
of Jonas; and, @%, a @er than Jonas is here.

11:33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
@', @" @[ a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they @
come in may see the light.

11:34 The light of the body is the eye: @fore when @ eye is
single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when @ eye is
evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

11:35 Take heed @fore that the light @ is in thee be not
darkness.

11:36 If thy whole body @fore be full of light, having no part
dark, the whole @ be full of light, as when the b@c shining of
a candle doth give thee light.

11:37 And as he @0, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not @O
washed @	 dinner.

11:39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of
ravening and wickedness.

11:40 Ye fools, did not he that made that @ is @S make that
@ is within also?  11:41 But rather give alms of such @ as ye
have; and, @%, all @ are clean unto you.

11:42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: @
ought ye to have done, and not to leave the @C undone.

11:43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

11:44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
graves @ appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware
of them.

11:45 Then @> one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
thus @ thou reproachest us also.

11:46 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens
with one of your fingers.

11:47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
your @s killed them.

11:48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your @s:
for they indeed killed them, and ye build @ sepulchres.

11:49 @N also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets
and apostles, and some of them they @ slay and persecute: 11:50
That the @I of all the prophets, @ was shed from the @Vation
of the world, may be required of this generation; 11:51 From the @I
of Abel unto the @I of Zacharias @ perished between the @\
and the temple: verily I say unto you, It @ be required of this
generation.

11:52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering
in ye hindered.

11:53 And as he said @ @ unto them, the scribes and the
Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to @K of
many @: 11:54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch some@7
out of his @P, that they @B accuse him.

12:1 In the mean time, when @ were ga@d @? an
innumerable multitude of @, insomuch that they trode one upon
@F, he began to say unto his disciples @O of all, Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, @ is hypocrisy.

12:2 For @ is no@7 covered, that @ not be revealed; @"
hid, that @ not be known.

12:3 @N whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness @ be @) in
the light; and that @ ye have spoken in the ear in closets @
be proclaimed upon the @tops.

12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
the body, and @ that have no more that they can do.

12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye @ fear: Fear him, @ @
he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear
him.

12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two far@, and not one of them
is forgotten @	 God?  12:7 But even the very hairs of your head
are all numbered. Fear not @fore: ye are of more value than many
sparrows.

12:8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever @ confess me @	 men, him
@ the Son of man also confess @	 the angels of God: 12:9 But
he that denieth me @	 men @ be denied @	 the angels of
God.

12:10 And whosoever @ @K a word @
 the Son of man, it
@ be for@= him: but unto him that blasphemeth @
 the Holy
Ghost it @ not be for@=.

12:11 And when they @( you unto the synagogues, and unto
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what @7 ye @
answer, or what ye @ say: 12:12 For the Holy Ghost @ teach you
in the same hour what ye ought to say.

12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, @K to my
@X, that he divide the inheritance with me.

12:14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
you?  12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the
@ @ he possesseth.

12:16 And he @0 a parable unto them, @, The ground of a
certain rich man @ @ plentifully: 12:17 And he thought
within @9, @, What @ I do, @ I have no room where
to bestow my fruits?  12:18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull
down my barns, and build @er; and @ will I bestow all my
fruits and my goods.

12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
for many @8; take @ ease, eat, @b, and be merry.

12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul @ be
required of thee: then whose @ @J @ be, @ thou hast
provided?  12:21 So is he that layeth up treasure for @9, and is
not rich toward God.

12:22 And he said unto his disciples, @N I say unto you, Take
no thought for your life, what ye @ eat; @" for the body,
what ye @ put on.

12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

12:24 Consider the ravens: for they @" sow nor reap; @
@" have store@ nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more
are ye better than the fowls?  12:25 And @ of you with taking
thought can add to his stature one cubit?  12:26 If ye then be not
able to do that @7 @ is least, why take ye thought for the
rest?  12:27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they
spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his @Y was
not arrayed like one of @.

12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, @ is to day in the field,
and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you,
O ye of little faith?  12:29 And seek not ye what ye @ eat, or
what ye @ @b, @" be ye of doubtful mind.

12:30 For all @ @ do the nations of the world seek @: and
your Father knoweth that ye have need of @ @.

12:31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all @ @
@ be added unto you.

12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.

12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags @
wax not old, a treasure in the @1s that faileth not, where no
thief approacheth, @" moth corrupteth.

12:34 For where your treasure is, @ will your @ be also.

12:35 Let your loins be girded @+, and your lights burning; 12:36
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for @ lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may
open unto him immediately.

12:37 Blessed are @J @<s, whom the lord when he cometh @
find watching: verily I say unto you, that he @ gird @9, and
make them to sit down to meat, and will come @ and serve them.

12:38 And if he @ come in the second watch, or come in the third
watch, and find them so, blessed are @J @<s.

12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the @ had known what
hour the thief @L come, he @L have watched, and not have
suffered his @ to be broken @E.

12:40 Be ye @fore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not.

12:41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, @Kest thou this parable unto
us, or even to all?  12:42 And the Lord said, Who then is that
faithful and wise steward, whom his lord @ make ruler over his
@hold, to give them @ portion of meat in due season?  12:43
Blessed is that @<, whom his lord when he cometh @ find so
doing.

12:44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
that he hath.

12:45 But and if that @< say in his @, My lord delayeth his
coming; and @ begin to beat the men@<s and maidens, and to
eat and @b, and to be drunken; 12:46 The lord of that @< will
come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is
not aware, and will cut him in s@[, and will appoint him his
portion with the unbelievers.

12:47 And that @<, @ knew his lord's will, and prepared not
@9, @" did @$ to his will, @ be beaten with many
stripes.

12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit @ worthy of stripes,

of him @ be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of
him they will ask the more.

12:49 I am come to send fire on the @; and what will I, if it be
already kindled?  12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and
how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  12:51 Suppose ye that I

12:53 The @ @ be divided @

12:54 And he said also to the @, When ye see a cloud rise out of
the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

12:55 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;
and it cometh to pass.

12:56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
@; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?  12:57 Yea, and
why even of yourselves judge ye not what is @c?  12:58 When thou
goest with @ adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way,
give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale
thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the
officer cast thee into prison.

12:59 I tell thee, thou @ not depart thence, till thou hast paid
the very last mite.

13:1 There were present at that season some that told him of the
Galilaeans, whose @I Pilate had mingled with @ sacrifices.

13:2 And @ answering said unto them, Suppose ye that @
Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, @ they
suffered such @?  13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye

13:4 Or @J eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew

13:6 He @0 also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted

13:7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, @., @

13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

13:11 And, @%, @ was a woman @ had a spirit of infirmity

13:12 And when @ saw her, he @, her to him, and said unto her,

13:18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and

13:20 And @* he said, Whereunto @ I liken the kingdom of God?

13:22 And he went @E the @G and villages, teaching, and
journeying toward @ .

13:23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are @ few that be saved? And
he said unto them, 13:24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for
many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and @ not be able.

13:25 When once the master of the @ is risen up, and hath shut to
the door, and ye begin to stand @S, and to knock at the door,
@, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he @ answer and say unto
you, I know you not whence ye are: 13:26 Then @ ye begin to say,
We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our
streets.

13:27 But he @ say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

13:28 There @ be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye @ see
Abraham, and Isaac, and @], and all the prophets, in the kingdom of
God, and you yourselves thrust out.

13:29 And they @ come from the east, and from the west, and from
the north, and from the south, and @ sit down in the kingdom of
God.

13:30 And, @%, @ are last @ @ be @O, and @ are
@O @ @ be last.

13:31 The same day @ came certain of the Pharisees, @ unto
him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, @., I cast
out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I
@ be perfected.

13:33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of @ .

13:34 O @ , @ , @ killest the prophets, and stonest
them that are sent unto thee; how often @L I have ga@d thy
@ @?, as a hen doth gather her brood @[ her wings, and
ye @L not!  13:35 @., your @ is left unto you desolate: and
verily I say unto you, Ye @ not see me, until the time come when
ye @ say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

14:1 And it came to pass, as he went into the @ of one of the
chief Pharisees to eat @d on the sabbath day, that they watched
him.

14:2 And, @%, @ was a certain man @	 him @ had the
dropsy.

14:3 And @ answering @0 unto the lawyers and Pharisees, @,
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?  14:4 And they held @
@U. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; 14:5 And
@> them, @, Which of you @ have an ass or an ox fallen
into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
14:6 And they could not answer him @* to @ @.

14:7 And he put @ a parable to @J @ were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; @ unto them.

14:8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
14:9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
@'; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

14:10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go
up higher: then @ thou have worship in the presence of them that
sit at meat with thee.

14:11 For whosoever exalteth @9 @ be abased; and he that
humbleth @9 @ be exalted.

14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy @3, @"
thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee @*,
and a recompence be made thee.

14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
lame, the blind: 14:14 And thou @ be blessed; for they cannot
recompense thee: for thou @ be recompensed at the resurrection of
the just.

14:15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him @) @
@, he said unto him, Blessed is he that @ eat @d in the
kingdom of God.

14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a @ supper, and
bade many: 14:17 And sent his @< at supper time to say to them
that were bidden, Come; for all @ are now ready.

14:18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The @O
said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go
and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

14:19 And @F said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

14:20 And @F said, I have married a wife, and @fore I cannot
come.

14:21 So that @< came, and shewed his lord @ @. Then the
master of the @ being angry said to his @<, Go out quickly
into the streets and lanes of the city, and @( in hither the poor,
and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

14:22 And the @< said, Lord, it is done as thou hast @M,
and yet @ is room.

14:23 And the lord said unto the @<, Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my @ may be filled.

14:24 For I say unto you, That none of @J men @ were bidden
@ taste of my supper.

14:25 And @ went @ multitudes with him: and he turned, and
said unto them, 14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his @,
and m@C, and wife, and @, and @3, and sisters, yea,
and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come @ me, cannot
be my disciple.

14:28 For @ of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
@O, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
14:29 Lest haply, @ he hath laid the @Vation, and is not able
to finish it, all that @% it begin to mock him, 14:30 Saying, This
man began to build, and was not able to finish.

14:31 Or what king, going to make war @
 @F king, sitteth
not down @O, and consulteth whether he be able with ten @: to
meet him that cometh @
 him with twenty @:?  14:32 Or else,
while the @C is yet a @ way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and
desireth conditions of @U.

14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
@ it be seasoned?  14:35 It is @" fit for the land, nor yet
for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let
him hear.

15:1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
him.

15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, @, This man
receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

15:3 And he @0 this parable unto them, @, 15:4 What man of
you, having an @/ sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go @ that @ is
lost, until he find it?  15:5 And when he hath @V it, he layeth it
on his @#ers, rejoicing.

15:6 And when he cometh home, he calleth @? his friends and
neighbours, @ unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have @V my
sheep @ was lost.

15:7 I say unto you, that likewise joy @ be in @1 over one
sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,
@ need no repentance.

15:8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the @, and seek
diligently till she find it?  15:9 And when she hath @V it, she
calleth her friends and her neighbours @?, @, Rejoice with
me; for I have @V the piece @ I had lost.

15:10 Likewise, I say unto you, @ is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

15:11 And he said, A certain man had two sons: 15:12 And the younger
of them said to his @, Father, give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.

15:13 And not many days @ the younger son ga@d all @?,
and took his journey into a far country, and @ wasted his
substance with riotous living.

15:14 And when he had spent all, @ arose a @By famine in that
land; and he began to be in want.

15:15 And he went and joined @9 to a citizen of that country; and
he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

15:16 And he @L fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

15:17 And when he came to @9, he said, How many hired @<s of
my @'s have @d enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
15:18 I will arise and go to my @, and will say unto him, Father,
I have sinned @
 @1, and @	 thee, 15:19 And am no more
worthy to be @, thy son: make me as one of thy hired @<s.

15:20 And he arose, and came to his @. But when he was yet a
@ way off, his @ saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
fell on his neck, and kissed him.

15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned @
 @1,
and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be @, thy son.

15:22 But the @ said to his @<s, Bring @ the best robe,
and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
15:23 And @( hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
and be merry: 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive @*; he
was lost, and is @V. And they began to be merry.

15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
to the @, he @) musick and dancing.

15:26 And he @, one of the @<s, and asked what @ @
meant.

15:27 And he said unto him, Thy @X is come; and thy @ hath
killed the fatted calf, @ he hath received him safe and sound.

15:28 And he was angry, and @L not go in: @fore came his @
out, and intreated him.

15:29 And he answering said to his @, Lo, @ many @8 do I
serve thee, @" transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I @B make merry with my
friends: 15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, @ hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf.

15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
have is @.

15:32 It was meet that we @# make merry, and be glad: for this thy
@X was dead, and is alive @*; and was lost, and is @V.

16:1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
man, @ had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he
had wasted his goods.

16:2 And he @, him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no
longer steward.

16:3 Then the steward said within @9, What @ I do? for my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am
ashamed.

16:4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
stewardship, they may receive me into @ @s.

16:5 So he @, @ one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said
unto the @O, How much owest thou unto my lord?  16:6 And he said,
An @/ measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
sit down quickly, and write fifty.

16:7 Then said he to @F, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
@/ measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
write fourscore.

16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, @ he had done
wisely: for the @ of this world are in @ generation wiser
than the @ of light.

16:9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
un@ceousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
everlasting habitations.

16:10 He that is faithful in that @ is least is faithful also in
much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

16:11 If @fore ye have not been faithful in the un@ceous
mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  16:12 And if
ye have not been faithful in that @ is @F man's, who @
give you that @ is your own?  16:13 No @< can serve two
masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the @C; or else
he will hold to the one, and despise the @C. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon.

16:14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, @) all @
@: and they derided him.

16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they @ justify yourselves
@	 men; but God knoweth your @s: for that @ is highly
esteemed @ men is abomination in the sight of God.

16:16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
kingdom of God is preached, and @ man presseth into it.

16:17 And it is easier for @1 and @ to pass, than one tittle
of the law to fail.

16:18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth @F,
committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adultery.

16:19 There was a certain rich man, @ was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously @ day: 16:20 And @ was a
certain beggar named Lazarus, @ was laid at his gate, full of
sores, 16:21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs @ fell from
the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was
buried; 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in @Z, and cool
my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good @, and likewise Lazarus evil @: but now
he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

16:26 And beside all this, between us and you @ is a @ gulf
fixed: so that they @ @L pass from hence to you cannot; @"
can they pass to us, that @L come from thence.

16:27 Then he said, I pray thee @fore, @, that thou @Lest
send him to my @'s @: 16:28 For I have five @3; that he
may testify unto them, lest they also come into this @' of torment.

16:29 Abraham @
 unto him, They have @ and the prophets; let
them hear them.

16:30 And he said, Nay, @ Abraham: but if one went unto them from
the dead, they will repent.

16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not @ and the prophets,
@" will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
offences will come: but woe unto him, @E whom they come!  17:2 It
were better for him that a millstone were hanged @+ his neck, and
he cast into the sea, than that he @# offend one of @ little
ones.

17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy @X trespass @
 thee,
rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

17:4 And if he trespass @
 thee @H times in a day, and @H
times in a day turn @* to thee, @, I repent; thou @
forgive him.

17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
@B say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and
be thou planted in the sea; and it @# obey you.

17:7 But @ of you, having a @< plowing or feeding cattle,
will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and
sit down to meat?  17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready
wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten
and drunken; and @ward thou @ eat and @b?  17:9 Doth he
thank that @< @ he did the @ that were @M him?
I trow not.

17:10 So likewise ye, when ye @ have done all @J @ @
are @M you, say, We are unprofitable @<s: we have done
that @ was our duty to do.

17:11 And it came to pass, as he went to @ , that he passed
@E the @a of Samaria and Galilee.

17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, @ met him ten men
that were lepers, @ stood afar off: 17:13 And they lifted up @
@;s, and said, @, Master, have mercy on us.

17:14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
the @6s. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were
cleansed.

17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
and with a loud @; glorified God, 17:16 And fell down on his face
at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

17:17 And @ answering said, Were @ not ten cleansed? but where
are the nine?  17:18 There are not @V that returned to give @Y
to God, save this stranger.

17:19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
thee whole.

17:20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
God @# come, he @> them and said, The kingdom of God cometh
not with observation: 17:21 Neither @ they say, Lo here! or, lo
@! for, @%, the kingdom of God is within you.

17:22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
@ desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye @
not see it.

17:23 And they @ say to you, See here; or, see @: go not @
them, nor follow them.

17:24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part @[
@1, shineth unto the @C part @[ @1; so @ also the
Son of man be in his day.

17:25 But @O must he suffer many @, and be rejected of this
generation.

17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so @ it be also in the
days of the Son of man.

17:27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were @= in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
came, and destroyed them all.

17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 17:29 But
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone
from @1, and destroyed them all.

17:30 Even thus @ it be in the day when the Son of man is
revealed.

17:31 In that day, he @ @ be upon the @top, and his stuff
in the @, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in
the field, let him likewise not return back.

17:32 Remember Lot's wife.

17:33 Whosoever @ seek to save his life @ lose it; and
whosoever @ lose his life @ preserve it.

17:34 I tell you, in that night @ @ be two men in one bed; the
one @ be taken, and the @C @ be left.

17:35 Two women @ be grinding @?; the one @ be taken,
and the @C left.

17:36 Two men @ be in the field; the one @ be taken, and the
@C left.

17:37 And they @> and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
ga@d @?.

18:1 And he @0 a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
always to pray, and not to faint; 18:2 Saying, There was in a city a
judge, @ feared not God, @" regarded man: 18:3 And @ was
a widow in that city; and she came unto him, @, Avenge me of mine
adversary.

18:4 And he @L not for a while: but @ward he said within
@9, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 18:5 Yet @ this
widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming
she weary me.

18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge @
.

18:7 And @ not God avenge his own elect, @ cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with them?  18:8 I tell you that he will
avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, @
he find faith on the @?  18:9 And he @0 this parable unto
certain @ trusted in @T that they were @ceous, and
despised @Cs: 18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the
one a Pharisee, and the @C a publican.

18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with @9, God, I thank
thee, that I am not as @C men are, extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican.

18:12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, @L not lift up so much
as his eyes unto @1, but smote upon his breast, @, God be
merciful to me a sinner.

18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his @ justified rather
than the @C: for @ one that exalteth @9 @ be abased;
and he that humbleth @9 @ be exalted.

18:15 And they @ unto him also infants, that he @L touch
them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

18:16 But @ @, them unto him, and said, Suffer little @
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
God.

18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever @ not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child @ in no wise enter @in.

18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, @, Good Master, what @ I
do to inherit eternal life?  18:19 And @ said unto him, Why
callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.

18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy @ and
thy m@C.

18:21 And he said, All @ have I kept from my youth up.

18:22 Now when @ @) @ @, he said unto him, Yet lackest
thou one @7: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,
and thou @ have treasure in @1: and come, follow me.

18:23 And when he @) this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
rich.

18:24 And when @ saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
hardly @ they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go @E a needle's eye, than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

18:26 And they that @) it said, Who then can be saved?  18:27 And
he said, The @ @ are impossible with men are possible with
God.

18:28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
that hath left @, or parents, or @3, or wife, or @,
for the kingdom of God's sake, 18:30 Who @ not receive manifold
more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

18:31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, @., we
go up to @ , and all @ that are written by the prophets
concerning the Son of man @ be accomplished.

18:32 For he @ be delivered unto the Gentiles, and @ be
mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 18:33 And they @
scourge him, and put him to @^: and the third day he @ rise
@*.

18:34 And they @[stood none of @ @: and this @ was
hid from them, @" knew they the @ @ were spoken.

18:35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 18:36 And hearing the
multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

18:37 And they told him, that @ of Nazareth passeth by.

18:38 And he cried, @, @, thou son of @, have mercy on
me.

18:39 And they @ went @	 rebuked him, that he @# hold his
@U: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of @, have mercy on
me.

18:40 And @ stood, and @M him to be @ unto him: and
when he was come near, he asked him, 18:41 Saying, What wilt thou that
I @ do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

18:42 And @ said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
thee.

18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
glorifying God: and all the @, when they saw it, gave praise unto
God.

19:1 And @ entered and passed @E Jericho.

19:2 And, @%, @ was a man named Zacchaeus, @ was the chief
@ the publicans, and he was rich.

19:3 And he sought to see @ who he was; and could not for the
press, @ he was little of stature.

19:4 And he ran @	, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
him: for he was to pass that way.

19:5 And when @ came to the @', he looked up, and saw him, and
said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must
abide at thy @.

19:6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, @, That he was gone
to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: @., Lord, the
half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any @7
from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

19:9 And @ said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
@, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that @ was
lost.

19:11 And as they @) @ @, he added and @0 a parable,
@ he was nigh to @ , and @ they thought that the
kingdom of God @# immediately appear.

19:12 He said @fore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for @9 a kingdom, and to return.

19:13 And he @, his ten @<s, and delivered them ten pounds,
and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message @ him,
@, We will not have this man to reign over us.

19:15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
the kingdom, then he @M @ @<s to be @, unto him,
to whom he had @= the money, that he @B know how much @ man
had gained by trading.

19:16 Then came the @O, @, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
pounds.

19:17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good @<: @ thou hast
been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten @G.

19:18 And the second came, @, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
pounds.

19:19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five @G.

19:20 And @F came, @, Lord, @%, here is thy pound, @
I have kept laid up in a napkin: 19:21 For I feared thee, @ thou
art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and
reapest that thou didst not sow.

19:22 And he @
 unto him, Out of @ own @P will I judge thee,
thou wicked @<. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up
that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 19:23 Wherefore
then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I @B
have required mine own with usury?  19:24 And he said unto them that
stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten
pounds.

19:25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)  19:26 For I
say unto you, That unto @ one @ hath @ be @=; and from
him that hath not, even that he hath @ be taken away from him.

19:27 But @J mine enemies, @ @L not that I @# reign over
them, @( hither, and slay them @	 me.

19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went @	, ascending up to
@ .

19:29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the mount @, the mount of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples, 19:30 Saying, Go ye into the village over @
 you; in
the @ at your entering ye @ find a colt tied, whereon yet
never man sat: loose him, and @( him hither.

19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus @ ye say
unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

19:32 And they that were sent went @ way, and @V even as he had
said unto them.

19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners @of said unto
them, Why loose ye the colt?  19:34 And they said, The Lord hath need
of him.

19:35 And they @ him to @: and they cast @ garments upon
the colt, and they set @ @on.

19:36 And as he went, they spread @ clothes in the way.

19:37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount
of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
praise God with a loud @; for all the @By works that they had
seen; 19:38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
Lord: @U in @1, and @Y in the highest.

19:39 And some of the Pharisees from @ the multitude said unto
him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

19:40 And he @> and said unto them, I tell you that, if @
@# hold @ @U, the stones @L immediately cry out.

19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
19:42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
day, the @ @ belong unto thy @U! but now they are hid from
@ eyes.

19:43 For the days @ come upon thee, that @ enemies @ cast
a trench @+ thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on @
side, 19:44 And @ lay thee even with the ground, and thy @
within thee; and they @ not leave in thee one stone upon @F;
@ thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
sold @in, and them that bought; 19:46 Saying unto them, It is
written, My @ is the @ of prayer: but ye have made it a den of
thieves.

19:47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief @6s and the
scribes and the chief of the @ sought to destroy him, 19:48 And
could not find what they @B do: for all the @ were very
attentive to hear him.

20:1 And it came to pass, that on one of @J days, as he taught the
@ in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief @6s and
the scribes came upon him with the elders, 20:2 And @0 unto him,
@, Tell us, by what authority doest thou @ @? or who is
he that gave thee this authority?  20:3 And he @> and said unto
them, I will also ask you one @7; and answer me: 20:4 The baptism
of John, was it from @1, or of men?  20:5 And they reasoned with
@T, @, If we @ say, From @1; he will say, Why
then believed ye him not?  20:6 But and if we say, Of men; all the
@ will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

20:7 And they @>, that they could not tell whence it was.

20:8 And @ said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
do @ @.

20:9 Then began he to @K to the @ this parable; A certain man
planted a vineyard, and let it @ to husbandmen, and went into a
far country for a long time.

20:10 And at the season he sent a @< to the husbandmen, that they
@# give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat
him, and sent him away empty.

20:11 And @* he sent @F @<: and they beat him also, and
entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

20:12 And @* he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
him out.

20:13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What @ I do? I will send
my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.

20:14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned @ @T,
@, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance
may be ours.

20:15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
@fore @ the lord of the vineyard do unto them?  20:16 He @
come and destroy @ husbandmen, and @ give the vineyard to
@Cs. And when they @) it, they said, God forbid.

20:17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
The stone @ the builders rejected, the same is become the head of
the corner?  20:18 Whosoever @ fall upon that stone @ be
broken; but on whomsoever it @ fall, it will grind him to powder.

20:19 And the chief @6s and the scribes the same hour sought to
lay @D on him; and they feared the @: for they perceived that
he had spoken this parable @
 them.

20:20 And they watched him, and sent @ spies, @ @# feign
@T just men, that they @B take hold of his @5, that so
they @B deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.

20:21 And they asked him, @, Master, we know that thou sayest and
teachest @cly, @" acceptest thou the person of any, but
teachest the way of God truly: 20:22 Is it lawful for us to give
tribute unto Caesar, or no?  20:23 But he perceived @ craftiness,
and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?  20:24 Shew me a penny. Whose
image and superscription hath it? They @> and said, Caesar's.

20:25 And he said unto them, Render @fore unto Caesar the @
@ be Caesar's, and unto God the @ @ be God's.

20:26 And they could not take hold of his @5 @	 the @: and
they marvelled at his answer, and held @ @U.

20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, @ deny that @
is any resurrection; and they asked him, 20:28 Saying, Master, @
wrote unto us, If any man's @X die, having a wife, and he die
@S @, that his @X @# take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his @X.

20:29 There were @fore @H @3: and the @O took a wife,
and died @S @.

20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

20:31 And the third took her; and in like manner the @H also: and
they left no @, and died.

20:32 Last of all the woman died also.

20:33 @N in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
@H had her to wife.

20:34 And @ answering said unto them, The @ of this world
marry, and are @= in marriage: 20:35 But they @ @ be
accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the
dead, @" marry, nor are @= in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they
die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the @
of God, being the @ of the resurrection.

20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even @ shewed at the bush,
when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of @].

20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
unto him.

20:39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
well said.

20:40 And @ that they durst not ask him any question at all.

20:41 And he said unto them, How say they that @2 is @'s son?
20:42 And @ @9 @
 in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
unto my Lord, Sit thou on my @c hand, 20:43 Till I make @
enemies thy footstool.

20:44 @ @fore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  20:45
Then in the audience of all the @ he said unto his disciples,
20:46 Beware of the scribes, @ desire to walk in long robes, and
love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 20:47 Which devour widows'
@s, and for a shew make long prayers: the same @ receive
@er damnation.

21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting @ gifts into
the treasury.

21:2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
mites.

21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
cast in more than they all: 21:4 For all @ have of @ abundance
cast in unto the @&s of God: but she of her penury hath cast in
all the living that she had.

21:5 And as some @0 of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts, he said, 21:6 As for @ @ @ ye @%,
the days will come, in the @ @ @ not be left one stone
upon @F, that @ not be thrown down.

21:7 And they asked him, @, Master, but when @ @ @
be?  and what sign will @ be when @ @ @ come to pass?
21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many @
come in my name, @, I am @2; and the time draweth near: go ye
not @fore @ them.

21:9 But when ye @ hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
for @ @ must @O come to pass; but the end is not by and
by.

21:10 Then said he unto them, Nation @ rise @
 nation, and
kingdom @
 kingdom: 21:11 And @ @quakes @ be in
divers @'s, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and
@ signs @ @ be from @1.

21:12 But @	 all @, they @ lay @ @D on you, and
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,
being @ @	 kings and rulers for my name's sake.

21:13 And it @ turn to you for a testimony.

21:14 Settle it @fore in your @s, not to meditate @	 what
ye @ answer: 21:15 For I will give you a @P and wisdom, @
all your adversaries @ not be able to gainsay nor resist.

21:16 And ye @ be betrayed both by parents, and @3, and
kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you @ they cause to be put to
@^.

21:17 And ye @ be hated of all men for my name's sake.

21:18 But @ @ not an hair of your head perish.

21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.

21:20 And when ye @ see @  compassed with armies, then know
that the desolation @of is nigh.

21:21 Then let them @ are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
them @ are in the @a of it depart out; and let not them that
are in the countries enter @into.

21:22 For @ be the days of vengeance, that all @ @ are
written may be fulfilled.

21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck, in @J days! for @ @ be @ distress in the land,
and wrath upon this @.

21:24 And they @ fall by the edge of the @Q, and @ be led
away captive into all nations: and @  @ be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

21:25 And @ @ be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the @ distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring; 21:26 Men's @s failing them for fear,
and for looking @ @J @ @ are coming on the @: for
the powers of @1 @ be shaken.

21:27 And then @ they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
power and @ @Y.

21:28 And when @ @ begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

21:29 And he @0 to them a parable; @. the fig tree, and all the
trees; 21:30 When they now shoot @, ye see and know of your own
selves that summer is now nigh at hand.

21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see @ @ come to pass, know ye
that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation @ not pass away, till
all be fulfilled.

21:33 Heaven and @ @ pass away: but my @5 @ not pass
away.

21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your @s be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,
and so that day come upon you unawares.

21:35 For as a snare @ it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole @.

21:36 Watch ye @fore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all @ @ that @ come to pass, and to
stand @	 the Son of man.

21:37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
he went out, and abode in the mount that is @, the mount of
Olives.

21:38 And all the @ came early in the morning to him in the
temple, for to hear him.

22:1 Now the feast of unleavened @d drew nigh, @ is @, the
Passover.

22:2 And the chief @6s and scribes sought how they @B kill him;
for they feared the @.

22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
number of the twelve.

22:4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief @6s and
captains, how he @B betray him unto them.

22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

22:6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
in the absence of the multitude.

22:7 Then came the day of unleavened @d, when the passover must be
killed.

22:8 And he sent Peter and John, @, Go and prepare us the
passover, that we may eat.

22:9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?  22:10
And he said unto them, @., when ye are entered into the city,
@ @ a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of @Z; follow him
into the @ where he entereth in.

22:11 And ye @ say unto the goodman of the @, The Master @

unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I @ eat the passover
with my disciples?  22:12 And he @ shew you a large upper room
furnished: @ make ready.

22:13 And they went, and @V as he had said unto them: and they made
ready the passover.

22:14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
with him.

22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you @	 I suffer: 22:16 For I say unto you, I will
not any more eat @of, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
divide it @ yourselves: 22:18 For I say unto you, I will not @b
of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God @ come.

22:19 And he took @d, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
them, @, This is my body @ is @= for you: this do in
remembrance of me.

22:20 Likewise also the cup @ supper, @, This cup is the new
testament in my @I, @ is shed for you.

22:21 But, @%, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
table.

22:22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
unto that man by whom he is betrayed!  22:23 And they began to enquire
@ @T, @ of them it was that @# do this @7.

22:24 And @ was also a strife @ them, @ of them @# be
accounted the @est.

22:25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are
@, benefactors.

22:26 But ye @ not be so: but he that is @est @ you, let
him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

22:27 For whether is @er, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am @ you as he
that serveth.

22:28 Ye are they @ have continued with me in my temptations.

22:29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
unto me; 22:30 That ye may eat and @b at my table in my kingdom,
and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of @.

22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, @%, Satan hath desired to
have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 22:32 But I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen
thy @3.

22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
into prison, and to @^.

22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock @ not crow this
day, @	 that thou @ thrice deny that thou knowest me.

22:35 And he said unto them, When I sent you @S purse, and scrip,
and shoes, lacked ye any @7? And they said, No@7.

22:36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no @Q, let him
sell his garment, and buy one.

22:37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
accomplished in me, And he was reckoned @ the transgressors: for
the @ concerning me have an end.

22:38 And they said, Lord, @%, here are two @Qs. And he said
unto them, It is enough.

22:39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

22:40 And when he was at the @', he said unto them, Pray that ye
enter not into temptation.

22:41 And he was withdrawn from them @+ a stone's cast, and kneeled
down, and prayed, 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove
this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but @, be done.

22:43 And @ appeared an angel unto him from @1, strengthening
him.

22:44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
was as it were @ drops of @I falling down to the ground.

22:45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
he @V them sleeping for sorrow, 22:46 And said unto them, Why sleep
ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

22:47 And while he yet @0, @% a multitude, and he that was
@, Judas, one of the twelve, went @	 them, and drew near unto
@ to kiss him.

22:48 But @ said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
with a kiss?  22:49 When they @ were @+ him saw what @L
follow, they said unto him, Lord, @ we smite with the @Q?
22:50 And one of them smote the @< of the high @6, and cut
off his @c ear.

22:51 And @ @> and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
his ear, and healed him.

22:52 Then @ said unto the chief @6s, and captains of the
temple, and the elders, @ were come to him, Be ye come out, as
@
 a thief, with @Qs and staves?  22:53 When I was daily with
you in the temple, ye stretched @ no @D @

your hour, and the power of darkness.

22:54 Then took they him, and led him, and @ him into the high
@6's @. And Peter followed afar off.

22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the @a of the hall, and
were set down @?, Peter sat down @ them.

22:56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

22:57 And he denied him, @, Woman, I know him not.

22:58 And @ a little while @F saw him, and said, Thou art
also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

22:59 And @+ the space of one hour @ @F confidently
affirmed, @, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is
a Galilaean.

22:60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
immediately, while he yet @0, the cock crew.

22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow,
thou @ deny me thrice.

22:62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

22:63 And the men that held @ mocked him, and smote him.

22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,
and asked him, @, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?  22:65 And
many @C @ blasphemously @0 they @
 him.

22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the @ and the
chief @6s and the scribes came @?, and led him into @
council, @, 22:67 Art thou the @2? tell us. And he said unto
them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 22:68 And if I also ask you,
ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

22:69 Here@ @ the Son of man sit on the @c hand of the
power of God.

22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
unto them, Ye say that I am.

22:71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
ourselves have @) of his own @P.

23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

23:2 And they began to accuse him, @, We @V this fellow
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
@ that he @9 is @2 a King.

23:3 And Pilate asked him, @, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
he @> him and said, Thou sayest it.

23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief @6s and to the @, I find
no fault in this man.

23:5 And they were the more fierce, @, He stirreth up the @,
teaching @Eout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this @'.

23:6 When Pilate @) of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean.

23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who @9 also was at @ 
at that time.

23:8 And when Herod saw @, he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season, @ he had @) many @
of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

23:9 Then he questioned with him in many @5; but he @> him
no@7.

23:10 And the chief @6s and scribes stood and vehemently accused
him.

23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,
and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him @* to Pilate.

23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends @?:
for @	 they were at enmity between @T.

23:13 And Pilate, when he had @, @? the chief @6s and
the rulers and the @, 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have @ this
man unto me, as one that perverteth the @: and, @%, I, having
examined him @	 you, have @V no fault in this man touching
@J @ whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I
sent you to him; and, lo, no@7 worthy of @^ is done unto him.

23:16 I will @fore chastise him, and release him.

23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
23:18 And they cried out all at once, @, Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas: 23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in
the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  23:20 Pilate
@fore, willing to release @, @0 @* to them.

23:21 But they cried, @, Crucify him, crucify him.

23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
done? I have @V no cause of @^ in him: I will @fore chastise
him, and let him go.

23:23 And they were instant with loud @;s, requiring that he @B
be crucified. And the @;s of them and of the chief @6s
prevailed.

23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it @# be as they required.

23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered @ to
@ will.

23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,
that he @B bear it @ @.

23:27 And @ followed him a @ company of @, and of women,
@ also bewailed and lamented him.

23:28 But @ turning unto them said, Daughters of @ , weep
not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your @.

23:29 For, @%, the days are coming, in the @ they @ say,
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
@ never gave suck.

23:30 Then @ they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
to the hills, Cover us.

23:31 For if they do @ @ in a green tree, what @ be done
in the dry?  23:32 And @ were also two @C, malefactors, led
with him to be put to @^.

23:33 And when they were come to the @', @ is @, Calvary,
@ they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the @c hand,
and the @C on the left.

23:34 Then said @, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

23:35 And the @ stood @%ing. And the rulers also with them
derided him, @, He saved @Cs; let him save @9, if he be
@2, the chosen of God.

23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and @&
him vinegar, 23:37 And @, If thou be the king of the Jews, save
thyself.

23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

23:39 And one of the malefactors @ were hanged railed on him,
@, If thou be @2, save thyself and us.

23:40 But the @C answering rebuked him, @, Dost not thou fear
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  23:41 And we indeed
justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath
done no@7 amiss.

23:42 And he said unto @, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom.

23:43 And @ said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day @
thou be with me in paradise.

23:44 And it was @+ the sixth hour, and @ was a darkness over
all the @ until the ninth hour.

23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
the @a.

23:46 And when @ had cried with a loud @;, he said, Father,
into thy @D I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up
the ghost.

23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
@, Certainly this was a @ceous man.

23:48 And all the @ that came @? to that sight, @%ing
the @ @ were done, smote @ breasts, and returned.

23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, @%ing @ @.

23:50 And, @%, @ was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
was a good man, and a just: 23:51 (The same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews:
who also @9 waited for the kingdom of God.

23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of @.

23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man @	 was laid.

23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

23:55 And the women also, @ came with him from Galilee, followed
@, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
the sabbath day @$ to the commandment.

24:1 Now upon the @O day of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, @(ing the spices @ they had
prepared, and certain @Cs with them.

24:2 And they @V the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

24:3 And they entered in, and @V not the body of the Lord @.

24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed @@+,
@%, two men stood by them in shining garments: 24:5 And as they
were afraid, and bowed down @ faces to the @, they said unto
them, Why seek ye the living @ the dead?  24:6 He is not here, but
is risen: remember how he @0 unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the @D of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise @*.

24:8 And they remembered his @5, 24:9 And returned from the
sepulchre, and told all @ @ unto the eleven, and to all the
rest.

24:10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the m@C of James,
and @C women that were with them, @ told @ @ unto the
apostles.

24:11 And @ @5 seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
them not.

24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
he beheld the linen clothes laid by @T, and departed,
wondering in @9 at that @ was come to pass.

24:13 And, @%, two of them went that same day to a village @,
Emmaus, @ was from @  @+ @@score furlongs.

24:14 And they talked @? of all @ @ @ had happened.

24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed @? and
reasoned, @ @9 drew near, and went with them.

24:16 But @ eyes were holden that they @# not know him.

24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are @
that ye have one to @F, as ye walk, and are sad?  24:18 And the
one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou
only a stranger in @ , and hast not known the @ @ are
come to pass @ in @ days?  24:19 And he said unto them, What
@? And they said unto him, Concerning @ of Nazareth, @
was a prophet @By in deed and word @	 God and all the @:
24:20 And how the chief @6s and our rulers delivered him to be
condemned to @^, and have crucified him.

24:21 But we trusted that it had been he @ @# have redeemed
@: and beside all this, to day is the third day since @
@ were done.

24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
@ were early at the sepulchre; 24:23 And when they @V not his
body, they came, @, that they had also seen a vision of angels,
@ said that he was alive.

24:24 And certain of them @ were with us went to the sepulchre,
and @V it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of @ to believe
all that the prophets have spoken: 24:26 Ought not @2 to have
suffered @ @, and to enter into his @Y?  24:27 And
beginning at @ and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the @ concerning @9.

24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
made as though he @L have gone further.

24:29 But they constrained him, @, Abide with us: for it is
toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with
them.

24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took @d,
and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

24:31 And @ eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
out of @ sight.

24:32 And they said one to @F, Did not our @ burn within us,
while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?  24:33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to
@ , and @V the eleven ga@d @?, and them that were
with them, 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared
to Simon.

24:35 And they told what @ were done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of @d.

24:36 And as they thus @0, @ @9 stood in the @a of
them, and @
 unto them, Peace be unto you.

24:37 But they were terrified and aff@ced, and supposed that they
had seen a spirit.

24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
arise in your @s?  24:39 @. my @D and my feet, that it is I
myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not @R and bones, as
ye see me have.

24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his @D and his
feet.

24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
unto them, Have ye here any meat?  24:42 And they gave him a piece of
a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

24:43 And he took it, and did eat @	 them.

24:44 And he said unto them, These are the @5 @ I @0 unto
you, while I was yet with you, that all @ must be fulfilled,
@ were written in the law of @, and in the prophets, and in
the psalms, concerning me.

24:45 Then opened he @ @[standing, that they @B @[stand
the scriptures, 24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus
it behoved @2 to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins @# be preached in

24:48 And ye are witnesses of @ @.

24:49 And, @%, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
ye in the city of @ , until ye be endued with power from on
high.

24:50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
@D, and blessed them.

24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
them, and carried up into @1.

24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to @  with @
joy: 24:53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing
God. Amen.




The Gospel According to Saint John


1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.

1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.

1:3 All @ were made by him; and @S him was not any @7
made that was made.

1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not.

1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
all men @E him @B believe.

1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

1:9 That was the true Light, @ lighteth @ man that cometh into
the world.

1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
knew him not.

1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 1:13 Which were
born, not of @I, nor of the will of the @R, nor of the will of
man, but of God.

1:14 And the Word was made @R, and dwelt @ us, (and we beheld
his @Y, the @Y as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth.

1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, @, This was he of whom
I @0, He that cometh @ me is preferred @	 me: for he was
@	 me.

1:16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

1:17 For the law was @= by @, but grace and truth came by @
@2.

1:18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, @ is
in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

1:19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent @6s and
Levites from @  to ask him, Who art thou?  1:20 And he
confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the @2.

1:21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he @
, I am
not. Art thou that prophet? And he @>, No.

1:22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  1:23 He said, I am
the @; of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of
the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

1:24 And they @ were sent were of the Pharisees.

1:25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
if thou be not that @2, nor Elias, @" that prophet?  1:26
John @> them, @, I baptize with @Z: but @ standeth
one @ you, whom ye know not; 1:27 He it is, who coming @ me is
preferred @	 me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

1:28 These @ were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
baptizing.

1:29 The next day John seeth @ coming unto him, and @
, @.
the Lamb of God, @ taketh away the sin of the world.

1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man @ is
preferred @	 me: for he was @	 me.

1:31 And I knew him not: but that he @# be made manifest to
@, @fore am I come baptizing with @Z.

1:32 And John bare record, @, I saw the Spirit descending from
@1 like a dove, and it abode upon him.

1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with @Z,
the same said unto me, Upon whom thou @ see the Spirit descending,
and remaining on him, the same is he @ baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost.

1:34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

1:35 Again the next day @ John stood, and two of his disciples;
1:36 And looking upon @ as he walked, he @
, @. the Lamb of
God!  1:37 And the two disciples @) him @K, and they followed
@.

1:38 Then @ turned, and saw them following, and @
 unto them,
What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (@ is to say, being
interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  1:39 He @
 unto them,
Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him
that day: for it was @+ the tenth hour.

1:40 One of the two @ @) John @K, and followed him, was
Andrew, Simon Peter's @X.

1:41 He @O findeth his own @X Simon, and @
 unto him, We
have @V the Messias, @ is, being interpreted, the @2.

1:42 And he @ him to @. And when @ beheld him, he said,
Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou @ be @, Cephas, @ is
by interpretation, A stone.

1:43 The day following @ @L go @ into Galilee, and findeth
Philip, and @
 unto him, Follow me.

1:44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and @
 unto him, We have @V him,
of whom @ in the law, and the prophets, did write, @ of
Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can @ any good @7 come out of
Nazareth? Philip @
 unto him, Come and see.

1:47 @ saw Nathanael coming to him, and @
 of him, @. an
@ite indeed, in whom is no guile!  1:48 Nathanael @
 unto him,
Whence knowest thou me? @ @> and said unto him, Before that
Philip @, thee, when thou wast @[ the fig tree, I saw thee.

1:49 Nathanael @> and @
 unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of
God; thou art the King of @.

1:50 @ @> and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
thee @[ the fig tree, believest thou? thou @ see @er @
than @.

1:51 And he @
 unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Here@
ye @ see @1 open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man.

2:1 And the third day @ was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
m@C of @ was @: 2:2 And both @ was @,, and his
disciples, to the marriage.

2:3 And when they wanted wine, the m@C of @ @
 unto him,
They have no wine.

2:4 @ @
 unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.

2:5 His m@C @
 unto the @<s, Whatsoever he @
 unto you,
do it.

2:6 And @ were set @ six @Zpots of stone, @ the manner
of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or @@ firkins apiece.

2:7 @ @
 unto them, Fill the @Zpots with @Z. And they
filled them up to the brim.

2:8 And he @
 unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.

2:9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the @Z that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the @<s @ drew the
@Z knew;) the governor of the feast @, the bridegroom, 2:10 And
@
 unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set @ good wine;
and when men have well drunk, then that @ is worse: but thou hast
kept the good wine until now.

2:11 This beginning of miracles did @ in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested @ his @Y; and his disciples believed on him.

2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his m@C, and his
@3, and his disciples: and they continued @ not many days.

2:13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and @ went up to
@ .

2:14 And @V in the temple @J that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
and the changers of money sitting: 2:15 And when he had made a scourge
of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep,
and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the
tables; 2:16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take @ @
hence; make not my Father's @ an @ of merchandise.

2:17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
@ @ hath eaten me up.

2:18 Then @> the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
unto us, seeing that thou doest @ @?  2:19 @ @> and
said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in @@ days I will raise it
up.

2:20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six @8 was this temple in
building, and wilt thou rear it up in @@ days?  2:21 But he @0
of the temple of his body.

2:22 When @fore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the
scripture, and the word @ @ had said.

2:23 Now when he was in @  at the passover, in the feast day,
many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles @ he did.

2:24 But @ did not commit @9 unto them, @ he knew all
men, 2:25 And needed not that any @# testify of man: for he knew
what was in man.

3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews: 3:2 The same came to @ by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do @
miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

3:3 @ @> and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born @*, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

3:4 Nicodemus @
 unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into his m@C's womb, and be born?  3:5
@ @>, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
of @Z and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

3:6 That @ is born of the @R is @R; and that @ is born
of the Spirit is spirit.

3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born @*.

3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
@of, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so
is @ one that is born of the Spirit.

3:9 Nicodemus @> and said unto him, How can @ @ be?
3:10 @ @> and said unto him, Art thou a master of @,
and knowest not @ @?  3:11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
We @K that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.

3:12 If I have told you @ly @, and ye believe not, how @
ye believe, if I tell you of @1ly @?  3:13 And no man hath
ascended up to @1, but he that came down from @1, even the Son
of man @ is in @1.

3:14 And as @ lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up: 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him
@# not perish, but have eternal life.

3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him @# not perish, but have
everlasting life.

3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world @E him @B be saved.

3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, @ he hath not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God.

3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
and men loved darkness rather than light, @ @ deeds were
evil.

3:20 For @ one that doeth evil hateth the light, @" cometh to
the light, lest his deeds @# be reproved.

3:21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

3:22 After @ @ came @ and his disciples into the land of
Judaea; and @ he tarried with them, and baptized.

3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, @ @
was much @Z @: and they came, and were baptized.

3:24 For John was not yet cast into prison.

3:25 Then @ arose a question between some of John's disciples and
the Jews @+ purifying.

3:26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, @%, the same
baptizeth, and all men come to him.

3:27 John @> and said, A man can receive no@7, except it be
@= him from @1.

3:28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the @2,
but that I am sent @	 him.

3:29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
bridegroom, @ standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth @ly @
of the bridegroom's @;: this my joy @fore is fulfilled.

3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.

3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the @
is @ly, and @Keth of the @: he that cometh from @1 is
above all.

3:32 And what he hath seen and @), that he testifieth; and no man
receiveth his testimony.

3:33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God
is true.

3:34 For he whom God hath sent @Keth the @5 of God: for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath @= all @ into his
hand.

3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
believeth not the Son @ not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him.

4:1 When @fore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had @) that
@ made and baptized more disciples than John, 4:2 (Though @
@9 baptized not, but his disciples,) 4:3 He left Judaea, and
departed @* into Galilee.

4:4 And he must needs go @E Samaria.

4:5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, @ is @, Sychar, near
to the parcel of ground that @] gave to his son Joseph.

4:6 Now @]'s well was @. @ @fore, being wearied with
his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was @+ the sixth hour.

4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw @Z: @ @
 unto
her, Give me to @b.

4:8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  4:9
Then @
 the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a
Jew, askest @b of me, @ am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews
have no dealings with the Samaritans.

4:10 @ @> and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
God, and who it is that @
 to thee, Give me to @b; thou @Lest
have asked of him, and he @L have @= thee living @Z.

4:11 The woman @
 unto him, Sir, thou hast no@7 to draw with,
and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living @Z?
4:12 Art thou @er than our @ @], @ gave us the well,
and drank @of @9, and his @, and his cattle?  4:13
@ @> and said unto her, Whosoever @beth of this @Z
@ thirst @*: 4:14 But whosoever @beth of the @Z that I
@ give him @ never thirst; but the @Z that I @ give him
@ be in him a well of @Z springing up into everlasting life.

4:15 The woman @
 unto him, Sir, give me this @Z, that I thirst
not, @" come hither to draw.

4:16 @ @
 unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

4:17 The woman @> and said, I have no husband. @ said unto
her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 4:18 For thou hast had
five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that
saidst thou truly.

4:19 The woman @
 unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet.

4:20 Our @s worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
@  is the @' where men ought to worship.

4:21 @ @
 unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
@ @" in this mountain, nor yet at @ , worship the
Father.

4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews.

4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers @
worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such
to worship him.

4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.

4:25 The woman @
 unto him, I know that Messias cometh, @ is
@, @2: when he is come, he will tell us all @.

4:26 @ @
 unto her, I that @K unto thee am he.

4:27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest
thou with her?  4:28 The woman then left her @Zpot, and went her
way into the city, and @
 to the men, 4:29 Come, see a man, @
told me all @ that ever I did: is not this the @2?  4:30 Then
they went out of the city, and came unto him.

4:31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, @, Master, eat.

4:32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

4:33 @N said the disciples one to @F, Hath any man @
him ought to eat?  4:34 @ @
 unto them, My meat is to do the
will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

4:35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
@%, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for
they are white already to harvest.

4:36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and ga@th fruit unto
life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
@?.

4:37 And herein is that @ true, One soweth, and @F reapeth.

4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: @C men
laboured, and ye are entered into @ labours.

4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
@ of the woman, @ testified, He told me all that ever I did.

4:40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
he @L tarry with them: and he abode @ two days.

4:41 And many more believed @ of his own word; 4:42 And said
unto the woman, Now we believe, not @ of thy @: for we have
@) him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the @2, the
Saviour of the world.

4:43 Now @ two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

4:44 For @ @9 testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
own country.

4:45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
having seen all the @ that he did at @  at the feast: for
they also went unto the feast.

4:46 So @ came @* into Cana of Galilee, where he made the @Z
wine. And @ was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at
Capernaum.

4:47 When he @) that @ was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
went unto him, and besought him that he @L come down, and heal his
son: for he was at the point of @^.

4:48 Then said @ unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
will not believe.

4:49 The nobleman @
 unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

4:50 @ @
 unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
believed the word that @ had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

4:51 And as he was now going down, his @<s met him, and told him,
@, Thy son liveth.

4:52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
they said unto him, Yesterday at the @Hth hour the fever left him.

4:53 So the @ knew that it was at the same hour, in the @
@ said unto him, Thy son liveth: and @9 believed, and his
whole @.

4:54 This is @* the second miracle that @ did, when he was come
out of Judaea into Galilee.

5:1 After this @ was a feast of the Jews; and @ went up to
@ .

5:2 Now @ is at @  by the sheep market a pool, @ is
@, in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

5:3 In @ lay a @ multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
wi@d, waiting for the moving of the @Z.

5:4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
troubled the @Z: whosoever then @O @ the troubling of the
@Z stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

5:5 And a certain man was @, @ had an infirmity thirty and
eight @8.

5:6 When @ saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case, he @
 unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?  5:7 The
impotent man @> him, Sir, I have no man, when the @Z is
troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, @F
steppeth down @	 me.

5:8 @ @
 unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

5:9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

5:10 The Jews @fore said unto him that was cured, It is the
sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

5:11 He @> them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
Take up thy bed, and walk.

5:12 Then asked they him, What man is that @ said unto thee, Take
up thy bed, and walk?  5:13 And he that was healed wist not who it
was: for @ had conveyed @9 away, a multitude being in that
@'.

5:14 Afterward @ findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
@., thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse @7 come unto
thee.

5:15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was @, @ had
made him whole.

5:16 And @fore did the Jews persecute @, and sought to slay
him, @ he had done @ @ on the sabbath day.

5:17 But @ @> them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

5:18 @N the Jews sought the more to kill him, @ he not
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,
making @9 equal with God.

5:19 Then @> @ and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The Son can do no@7 of @9, but what he seeth the
Father do: for what @ soever he doeth, @ also doeth the Son
likewise.

5:20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all @ that
@9 doeth: and he will shew him @er works than @, that ye
may marvel.

5:21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

5:22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son: 5:23 That all men @# honour the Son, even as they
honour the Father.

He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father @ hath sent
him.

5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and @ not
come into condemnation; but is passed from @^ unto life.

5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead @ hear the @; of the Son of God: and they that
hear @ live.

5:26 For as the Father hath life in @9; so hath he @= to the
Son to have life in @9; 5:27 And hath @= him authority to
execute judgment also, @ he is the Son of man.

5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the @ all that
are in the graves @ hear his @;, 5:29 And @ come @;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

5:30 I can of mine own self do no@7: as I hear, I judge: and my
judgment is just; @ I seek not mine own will, but the will of
the Father @ hath sent me.

5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

5:32 There is @F that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
witness @ he witnesseth of me is true.

5:33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

5:34 But I receive not testimony from man: but @ @ I say,
that ye @B be saved.

5:35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
season to rejoice in his light.

5:36 But I have @er witness than that of John: for the works @
the Father hath @= me to finish, the same works that I do, bear
witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

5:37 And the Father @9, @ hath sent me, hath borne witness of
me.

Ye have @" @) his @; at any time, nor seen his shape.

5:38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,
him ye believe not.

5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:
and they are they @ testify of me.

5:40 And ye will not come to me, that ye @B have life.

5:41 I receive not honour from men.

5:42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

5:43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if @F
@ come in his own name, him ye will receive.

5:44 How can ye believe, @ receive honour one of @F, and seek
not the honour that cometh from God only?  5:45 Do not think that I
will accuse you to the Father: @ is one that accuseth you, even
@, in whom ye trust.

5:46 For had ye believed @, ye @L have believed me; for he
wrote of me.

5:47 But if ye believe not his writings, how @ ye believe my
@5?  6:1 After @ @ @ went over the sea of Galilee,
@ is the sea of Tiberias.

6:2 And a @ multitude followed him, @ they saw his miracles
@ he did on them that were diseased.

6:3 And @ went up into a mountain, and @ he sat with his
disciples.

6:4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

6:5 When @ then lifted up his eyes, and saw a @ company come
unto him, he @
 unto Philip, Whence @ we buy @d, that @
may eat?  6:6 And this he said to prove him: for he @9 knew what
he @L do.

6:7 Philip @> him, Two @/ pennyworth of @d is not
sufficient for them, that @ one of them may take a little.

6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's @X, @
 unto
him, 6:9 There is a lad here, @ hath five barley loaves, and two
small fishes: but what are they @ so many?  6:10 And @ said,
Make the men sit down. Now @ was much grass in the @'. So the
men sat down, in number @+ five @:.

6:11 And @ took the loaves; and when he had @= thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set
down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they @L.

6:12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remain, that no@7 be lost.

6:13 @N they ga@d them @?, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves, @ remained over and
above unto them that had eaten.

6:14 Then @J men, when they had seen the miracle that @ did,
said, This is of a truth that prophet that @# come into the world.

6:15 When @ @fore perceived that they @L come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he departed @* into a mountain
@9 alone.

6:16 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
6:17 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
And it was now dark, and @ was not come to them.

6:18 And the sea arose by reason of a @ wind that blew.

6:19 So when they had rowed @+ five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see @ walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and
they were afraid.

6:20 But he @
 unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

6:21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they went.

6:22 The day following, when the @ @ stood on the @C side
of the sea saw that @ was none @C boat @, save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that @ went not with his
disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
6:23 (Howbeit @ came @C boats from Tiberias nigh unto the @'
where they did eat @d, @ that the Lord had @= thanks:) 6:24
When the @ @fore saw that @ was not @, @" his
disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for
@.

6:25 And when they had @V him on the @C side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  6:26 @ @>
them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not @
ye saw the miracles, but @ ye did eat of the loaves, and were
filled.

6:27 Labour not for the meat @ perisheth, but for that meat @
endureth unto everlasting life, @ the Son of man @ give unto
you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

6:28 Then said they unto him, What @ we do, that we @B work the
works of God?  6:29 @ @> and said unto them, This is the
work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

6:30 They said @fore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  6:31 Our @s
did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them @d from
@1 to eat.

6:32 Then @ said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, @
gave you not that @d from @1; but my Father giveth you the true
@d from @1.

6:33 For the @d of God is he @ cometh down from @1, and
giveth life unto the world.

6:34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this @d.

6:35 And @ said unto them, I am the @d of life: he that cometh
to me @ never hunger; and he that believeth on me @ never
thirst.

6:36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.

6:37 All that the Father giveth me @ come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

6:38 For I came down from @1, not to do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.

6:39 And this is the Father's will @ hath sent me, that of all
@ he hath @= me I @# lose no@7, but @# raise it up
@* at the last day.

6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that @ one @
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I
will raise him up at the last day.

6:41 The Jews then murmured at him, @ he said, I am the @d
@ came down from @1.

6:42 And they said, Is not this @, the son of Joseph, whose @
and m@C we know? how is it then that he @
, I came down from
@1?  6:43 @ @fore @> and said unto them, Murmur not
@ yourselves.

6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father @ hath sent me draw
him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they @ be all taught of
God.

Every man @fore that hath @), and hath learned of the Father,
cometh unto me.

6:46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he @ is of God,
he hath seen the Father.

6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life.

6:48 I am that @d of life.

6:49 Your @s did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

6:50 This is the @d @ cometh down from @1, that a man may
eat @of, and not die.

6:51 I am the living @d @ came down from @1: if any man eat
of this @d, he @ live for ever: and the @d that I will give
is my @R, @ I will give for the life of the world.

6:52 The Jews @fore strove @ @T, @, How can this
man give us his @R to eat?  6:53 Then @ said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the @R of the Son of man, and
@b his @I, ye have no life in you.

6:54 Whoso eateth my @R, and @beth my @I, hath eternal life;
and I will raise him up at the last day.

6:55 For my @R is meat indeed, and my @I is @b indeed.

6:56 He that eateth my @R, and @beth my @I, dwelleth in me,
and I in him.

6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so
he that eateth me, even he @ live by me.

6:58 This is that @d @ came down from @1: not as your
@s did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this @d
@ live for ever.

6:59 These @ said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

6:60 Many @fore of his disciples, when they had @) this, said,
This is an hard @; who can hear it?  6:61 When @ knew in
@9 that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth
this offend you?  6:62 What and if ye @ see the Son of man ascend
up where he was @	?  6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the
@R profiteth no@7: the @5 that I @K unto you, they are
spirit, and they are life.

6:64 But @ are some of you that believe not. For @ knew from
the beginning who they were that believed not, and who @# betray
him.

6:65 And he said, @N said I unto you, that no man can come unto
me, except it were @= unto him of my Father.

6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him.

6:67 Then said @ unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  6:68 Then
Simon Peter @> him, Lord, to whom @ we go? thou hast the
@5 of eternal life.

6:69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that @2, the Son of
the living God.

6:70 @ @> them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is a devil?  6:71 He @0 of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he
it was that @# betray him, being one of the twelve.

7:1 After @ @ @ walked in Galilee: for he @L not walk
in Jewry, @ the Jews sought to kill him.

7:2 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

7:3 His @3 @fore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

7:4 For @ is no man that doeth any @7 in secret, and he @9
seeketh to be known openly. If thou do @ @, shew thyself to
the world.

7:5 For @" did his @3 believe in him.

7:6 Then @ said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
is alway ready.

7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, @ I testify of
it, that the works @of are evil.

7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my
time is not yet full come.

7:9 When he had said @ @5 unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

7:10 But when his @3 were gone up, then went he also up unto the
feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

7:11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
7:12 And @ was much murmuring @ the @ concerning him: for
some said, He is a good man: @Cs said, Nay; but he deceiveth the
@.

7:13 Howbeit no man @0 openly of him for fear of the Jews.

7:14 Now @+ the @a of the feast @ went up into the temple,
and taught.

7:15 And the Jews marvelled, @, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?  7:16 @ @> them, and said, My doctrine
is not mine, but his that sent me.

7:17 If any man will do his will, he @ know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I @K of myself.

7:18 He that @Keth of @9 seeketh his own @Y: but he that
seeketh his @Y that sent him, the same is true, and no
un@ceousness is in him.

7:19 Did not @ give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
law?  Why go ye @+ to kill me?  7:20 The @ @> and said,
Thou hast a devil: who goeth @+ to kill thee?  7:21 @ @>
and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

7:22 @ @fore gave unto you circumcision; (not @ it is of
@, but of the @s;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a
man.

7:23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
@ @# not be broken; are ye angry at me, @ I have made a
man @ whit whole on the sabbath day?  7:24 Judge not @$ to
the appearance, but judge @ceous judgment.

7:25 Then said some of them of @ , Is not this he, whom they
seek to kill?  7:26 But, lo, he @Keth boldly, and they say no@7
unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very @2?
7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when @2 cometh, no
man knoweth whence he is.

7:28 Then cried @ in the temple as he taught, @, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.

7:29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

7:30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid @D on him,
@ his hour was not yet come.

7:31 And many of the @ believed on him, and said, When @2
cometh, will he do more miracles than @ @ this man hath done?
7:32 The Pharisees @) that the @ murmured such @
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief @6s sent officers
to take him.

7:33 Then said @ unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
then I go unto him that sent me.

7:34 Ye @ seek me, and @ not find me: and where I am, thither
ye cannot come.

7:35 Then said the Jews @ @T, Whither will he go, that we
@ not find him? will he go unto the dispersed @ the Gentiles,
and teach the Gentiles?  7:36 What manner of @ is this that he
said, Ye @ seek me, and @ not find me: and where I am, thither
ye cannot come?  7:37 In the last day, that @ day of the feast,
@ stood and cried, @, If any man thirst, let him come unto
me, and @b.

7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
belly @ flow rivers of living @Z.

7:39 (But this @0 he of the Spirit, @ they that believe on him
@# receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet @=; @ that
@ was not yet glorified.)  7:40 Many of the @ @fore, when
they @) this @, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

7:41 Others said, This is the @2. But some said, Shall @2 come
out of Galilee?  7:42 Hath not the scripture said, That @2 cometh
of the seed of @, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where @
was?  7:43 So @ was a division @ the @ @ of him.

7:44 And some of them @L have taken him; but no man laid @D on
him.

7:45 Then came the officers to the chief @6s and Pharisees; and
they said unto them, Why have ye not @ him?  7:46 The officers
@>, Never man @0 like this man.

7:47 Then @> them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  7:48
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?  7:49 But
this @ who knoweth not the law are cursed.

7:50 Nicodemus @
 unto them, (he that came to @ by night, being
one of them,) 7:51 Doth our law judge any man, @	 it hear him, and
know what he doeth?  7:52 They @> and said unto him, Art thou
also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet.

7:53 And @ man went unto his own @.

8:1 @ went unto the mount of Olives.

8:2 And early in the morning he came @* into the temple, and all
the @ came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees @ unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her in the @a, 8:4 They say unto
him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

8:5 Now @ in the law @M us, that such @# be stoned: but
what sayest thou?  8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they @B
have to accuse him. But @ stooped down, and with his finger wrote
on the ground, as though he @) them not.

8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up @9, and said
unto them, He that is @S sin @ you, let him @O cast a
stone at her.

8:8 And @* he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

8:9 And they @ @) it, being convicted by @ own conscience,
went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and
@ was left alone, and the woman standing in the @a.

8:10 When @ had lifted up @9, and saw none but the woman, he
said unto her, Woman, where are @J @ accusers? hath no man
condemned thee?  8:11 She said, No man, Lord. And @ said unto her,
Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

8:12 Then @0 @ @* unto them, @, I am the light of the
world: he that followeth me @ not walk in darkness, but @ have
the light of life.

8:13 The Pharisees @fore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true.

8:14 @ @> and said unto them, Though I bear record of
myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I
go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

8:15 Ye judge @ the @R; I judge no man.

8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but
I and the Father that sent me.

8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
true.

8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth witness of me.

8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? @ @>, Ye
@" know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye @# have
known my Father also.

8:20 These @5 @0 @ in the treasury, as he taught in the
temple: and no man laid @D on him; for his hour was not yet come.

8:21 Then said @ @* unto them, I go my way, and ye @ seek
me, and @ die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

8:22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill @9? @ he @
,
Whither I go, ye cannot come.

8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye
are of this world; I am not of this world.

8:24 I said @fore unto you, that ye @ die in your sins: for if
ye believe not that I am he, ye @ die in your sins.

8:25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And @ @
 unto them,
Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

8:26 I have many @ to say and to judge of you: but he that sent
me is true; and I @K to the world @J @ @ I have @)
of him.

8:27 They @[stood not that he @0 to them of the Father.

8:28 Then said @ unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,
then @ ye know that I am he, and that I do no@7 of myself; but
as my Father hath taught me, I @K @ @.

8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
alone; for I do always @J @ that please him.

8:30 As he @0 @ @5, many believed on him.

8:31 Then said @ to @J Jews @ believed on him, If ye
continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 8:32 And ye
@ know the truth, and the truth @ make you free.

8:33 They @> him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye @ be made free?  8:34
@ @> them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
committeth sin is the @< of sin.

8:35 And the @< abideth not in the @ for ever: but the Son
abideth ever.

8:36 If the Son @fore @ make you free, ye @ be free
indeed.

8:37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,
@ my word hath no @' in you.

8:38 I @K that @ I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
@ ye have seen with your @.

8:39 They @> and said unto him, Abraham is our @. @
@
 unto them, If ye were Abraham's @, ye @L do the works
of Abraham.

8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,
@ I have @) of God: this did not Abraham.

8:41 Ye do the deeds of your @. Then said they to him, We be not
born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

8:42 @ said unto them, If God were your Father, ye @L love me:
for I proceeded @ and came from God; @" came I of myself, but
he sent me.

8:43 Why do ye not @[stand my speech? even @ ye cannot hear
my word.

8:44 Ye are of your @ the devil, and the lusts of your @ ye
will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth, @ @ is no truth in him. When he @Keth a lie, he
@Keth of his own: for he is a liar, and the @ of it.

8:45 And @ I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
ye not believe me?  8:47 He that is of God heareth God's @5: ye
@fore hear them not, @ ye are not of God.

8:48 Then @> the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  8:49 @ @>, I have
not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

8:50 And I seek not mine own @Y: @ is one that seeketh and
judgeth.

8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my @, he @
never see @^.

8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.

Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
@, he @ never taste of @^.

8:53 Art thou @er than our @ Abraham, @ is dead? and the
prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  8:54 @ @>, If
I honour myself, my honour is no@7: it is my Father that honoureth
me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 8:55 Yet ye have not known
him; but I know him: and if I @# say, I know him not, I @ be a
liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his @.

8:56 Your @ Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
was glad.

8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty @8 old,
and hast thou seen Abraham?  8:58 @ said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

8:59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but @ hid @9,
and went out of the temple, going @E the @a of them, and so
passed by.

9:1 And as @ passed by, he saw a man @ was blind from his
birth.

9:2 And his disciples asked him, @, Master, who did sin, this
man, or his parents, that he was born blind?  9:3 @ @>,
Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of
God @# be made manifest in him.

9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work.

9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
9:7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (@ is by
interpretation, Sent.) He went his way @fore, and washed, and came
seeing.

9:8 The neighbours @fore, and they @ @	 had seen him that
he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  9:9 Some
said, This is he: @Cs said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.

9:10 @N said they unto him, How were @ eyes opened?  9:11
He @> and said, A man that is @, @ made clay, and
anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and
wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.

9:12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

9:13 They @ to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

9:14 And it was the sabbath day when @ made the clay, and opened
his eyes.

9:15 Then @* the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,
and do see.

9:16 @N said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
@ he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles? And @ was a division @
them.

9:17 They say unto the blind man @*, What sayest thou of him, that
he hath opened @ eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

9:18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until they @, the parents of him
that had received his sight.

9:19 And they asked them, @, Is this your son, who ye say was
born blind? how then doth he now see?  9:20 His parents @> them
and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
9:21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he @ @K for
@9.

9:22 These @5 @0 his parents, @ they feared the Jews: for
the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was
@2, he @# be put out of the synagogue.

9:23 @N said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

9:24 Then @* @, they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

9:25 He @> and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:
one @7 I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

9:26 Then said they to him @*, What did he to thee? how opened he
@ eyes?  9:27 He @> them, I have told you already, and ye
did not hear: wherefore @L ye hear it @*? will ye also be his
disciples?  9:28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his
disciple; but we are @' disciples.

9:29 We know that God @0 unto @: as for this fellow, we know
not from whence he is.

9:30 The man @> and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
@7, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine
eyes.

9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

9:32 Since the world began was it not @) that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind.

9:33 If this man were not of God, he could do no@7.

9:34 They @> and said unto him, Thou wast al@? born in
sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

9:35 @ @) that they had cast him out; and when he had @V
him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  9:36 He
@> and said, Who is he, Lord, that I @B believe on him?  9:37
And @ said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that
talketh with thee.

9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

9:39 And @ said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
@ see not @B see; and that they @ see @B be made blind.

9:40 And some of the Pharisees @ were with him @) @ @5,
and said unto him, Are we blind also?  9:41 @ said unto them, If
ye were blind, ye @# have no sin: but now ye say, We see;
@fore your sin remaineth.

10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some @C way, the same is a
thief and a robber.

10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his @;: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

10:4 And when he putteth @ his own sheep, he goeth @	 them,
and the sheep follow him: for they know his @;.

10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
they know not the @; of strangers.

10:6 This parable @0 @ unto them: but they @[stood not what
@ they were @ he @0 unto them.

10:7 Then said @ unto them @*, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
I am the door of the sheep.

10:8 All that ever came @	 me are thieves and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them.

10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he @ be saved, and
@ go in and out, and find pasture.

10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy: I am come that they @B have life, and that they @B have
it more abundantly.

10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep.

10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

10:13 The hireling fleeth, @ he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep.

10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
down my life for the sheep.

10:16 And @C sheep I have, @ are not of this fold: them also I
must @(, and they @ hear my @;; and @ @ be one fold,
and one shepherd.

10:17 @N doth my Father love me, @ I lay down my life,
that I @B take it @*.

10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it @*. This
commandment have I received of my Father.

10:19 There was a division @fore @* @ the Jews for @
@s.

10:20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
him?  10:21 Others said, These are not the @5 of him that hath a
devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?  10:22 And it was at
@  the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

10:23 And @ walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

10:24 Then came the Jews round @+ him, and said unto him, How long
dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the @2, tell us plainly.

10:25 @ @> them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

10:26 But ye believe not, @ ye are not of my sheep, as I said
unto you.

10:27 My sheep hear my @;, and I know them, and they follow me:
10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they @ never perish,
@" @ any man pluck them out of my hand.

10:29 My Father, @ gave them me, is @er than all; and no man
is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

10:30 I and my Father are one.

10:31 Then the Jews took up stones @* to stone him.

10:32 @ @> them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
Father; for @ of @J works do ye stone me?  10:33 The Jews
@> him, @, For a good work we stone thee not; but for
blasphemy; and @ that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

10:34 @ @> them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
are gods?  10:35 If he @, them gods, unto whom the word of God
came, and the scripture cannot be broken; 10:36 Say ye of him, whom
the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;
@ I said, I am the Son of God?  10:37 If I do not the works of
my Father, believe me not.

10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

10:39 @N they sought @* to take him: but he escaped out of
@ hand, 10:40 And went away @* beyond Jordan into the @'
where John at @O baptized; and @ he abode.

10:41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
all @ that John @0 of this man were true.

10:42 And many believed on him @.

11:1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
of Mary and her sister Martha.

11:2 (It was that Mary @ anointed the Lord with ointment, and
wiped his feet with her hair, whose @X Lazarus was sick.)  11:3
@N his sisters sent unto him, @, Lord, @%, he whom
thou lovest is sick.

11:4 When @ @) that, he said, This sickness is not unto @^,
but for the @Y of God, that the Son of God @B be glorified
@by.

11:5 Now @ loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

11:6 When he had @) @fore that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same @' where he was.

11:7 Then @ that @
 he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
@*.

11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither @*?  11:9 @ @>, Are
@ not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he
stumbleth not, @ he seeth the light of this world.

11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, @ @ is
no light in him.

11:11 These @ said he: and @ that he @
 unto them, Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he @ do well.

11:13 Howbeit @ @0 of his @^: but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

11:14 Then said @ unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not @, to the intent
ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

11:16 Then said Thomas, @ is @, Didymus, unto his
fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

11:17 Then when @ came, he @V that he had lain in the grave
four days already.

11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto @ , @+ fifteen furlongs off:
11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning @ @X.

11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she @) that @ was coming, went
and met him: but Mary sat still in the @.

11:21 Then said Martha unto @, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
@X had not died.

11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it thee.

11:23 @ @
 unto her, Thy @X @ rise @*.

11:24 Martha @
 unto him, I know that he @ rise @* in the
resurrection at the last day.

11:25 @ said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet @ he live: 11:26
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me @ never die. Believest
thou this?  11:27 She @
 unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou
art the @2, the Son of God, @ @# come into the world.

11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and @, Mary her
sister secretly, @, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

11:29 As soon as she @) that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

11:30 Now @ was not yet come into the town, but was in that @'
where Martha met him.

11:31 The Jews then @ were with her in the @, and comforted
her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
followed her, @, She goeth unto the grave to weep @.

11:32 Then when Mary was come where @ was, and saw him, she fell
down at his feet, @ unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
@X had not died.

11:33 When @ @fore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
@ came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.

11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
and see.

11:35 @ wept.

11:36 Then said the Jews, @. how he loved him!  11:37 And some of
them said, Could not this man, @ opened the eyes of the blind,
have caused that even this man @# not have died?  11:38 @
@fore @* groaning in @9 cometh to the grave. It was a
cave, and a stone lay upon it.

11:39 @ said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
that was dead, @
 unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he
hath been dead four days.

11:40 @ @
 unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
@Lest believe, thou @#est see the @Y of God?  11:41 Then
they took away the stone from the @' where the dead was laid. And
@ lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou
hast @) me.

11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but @ of the
@ @ stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast
sent me.

11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud @;,
Lazarus, come @.

11:44 And he that was dead came @, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound @+ with a napkin. @ @

unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

11:45 Then many of the Jews @ came to Mary, and had seen the
@ @ @ did, believed on him.

11:46 But some of them went @ ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what @ @ had done.

11:47 Then ga@d the chief @6s and the Pharisees a council, and
said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
Romans @ come and take away both our @' and nation.

11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high @6 that same
year, said unto them, Ye know no@7 at all, 11:50 Nor consider that
it is expedient for us, that one man @# die for the @, and
that the whole nation perish not.

11:51 And this @0 he not of @9: but being high @6 that
year, he prophesied that @ @# die for that nation; 11:52 And
not for that nation only, but that also he @# gather @? in
one the @ of God that were scattered abroad.

11:53 Then from that day @ they took counsel @? for to put
him to @^.

11:54 @ @fore walked no more openly @ the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city @,
Ephraim, and @ continued with his disciples.

11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
the country up to @  @	 the passover, to purify @T.

11:56 Then sought they for @, and @0 @ @T, as they
stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the
feast?  11:57 Now both the chief @6s and the Pharisees had @= a
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he @# shew it,
that they @B take him.

12:1 Then @ six days @	 the passover came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was, @ had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him.

12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
anointed the feet of @, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the
@ was filled with the odour of the ointment.

12:4 Then @
 one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
@ @# betray him, 12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for @@
@/ pence, and @= to the poor?  12:6 This he said, not that he
cared for the poor; but @ he was a thief, and had the bag, and
bare what was put @in.

12:7 Then said @, Let her alone: @
 the day of my burying
hath she kept this.

12:8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

12:9 Much @ of the Jews @fore knew that he was @: and
they came not for @' sake only, but that they @B see Lazarus
also, whom he had raised from the dead.

12:10 But the chief @6s consulted that they @B put Lazarus also
to @^; 12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went
away, and believed on @.

12:12 On the next day much @ that were come to the feast, when
they @) that @ was coming to @ , 12:13 Took branches of
palm trees, and went @ to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is
the King of @ that cometh in the name of the Lord.

12:14 And @, when he had @V a young ass, sat @on; as it is
written, 12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: @%, thy King cometh,
sitting on an ass's colt.

12:16 These @ @[stood not his disciples at the @O: but when
@ was glorified, then remembered they that @ @ were
written of him, and that they had done @ @ unto him.

12:17 The @ @fore that was with him when he @, Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

12:18 For this cause the @ also met him, for that they @) that
he had done this miracle.

12:19 The Pharisees @fore said @ @T, Perceive ye how
ye prevail no@7? @%, the world is gone @ him.

12:20 And @ were certain Greeks @ them that came up to worship
at the feast: 12:21 The same came @fore to Philip, @ was of
Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, @, Sir, we @L see
@.

12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and @* Andrew and Philip
tell @.

12:23 And @ @> them, @, The hour is come, that the Son
of man @# be glorified.

12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it @(eth @
much fruit.

12:25 He that loveth his life @ lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world @ keep it unto life eternal.

12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, @
@ also my @< be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
honour.

12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what @ I say? Father, save me
from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came @ a @; from @1,
@, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it @*.

12:29 The @ @fore, that stood by, and @) it, said that it
th@[ed: @Cs said, An angel @0 to him.

12:30 @ @> and said, This @; came not @ of me, but
for your sakes.

12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now @ the prince of this
world be cast out.

12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the @, will draw all men unto
me.

12:33 This he said, signifying what @^ he @# die.

12:34 The @ @> him, We have @) out of the law that
@2 abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be
lifted up? who is this Son of man?  12:35 Then @ said unto them,
Yet a little while is the light with you.

Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
@ of light. These @ @0 @, and departed, and did
hide @9 from them.

12:37 But though he had done so many miracles @	 them, yet they
believed not on him: 12:38 That the @ of Esaias the prophet @B
be fulfilled, @ he @0, Lord, who hath believed our report? and
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  12:39 @N they
could not believe, @ that Esaias said @*, 12:40 He hath
blinded @ eyes, and hardened @ @; that they @# not see
with @ eyes, nor @[stand with @ @, and be converted,
and I @# heal them.

12:41 These @ said Esaias, when he saw his @Y, and @0 of
him.

12:42 Nevertheless @ the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but @ of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they
@# be put out of the synagogue: 12:43 For they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of God.

12:44 @ cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me.

12:45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
@# not abide in darkness.

12:47 And if any man hear my @5, and believe not, I judge him not:
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my @5, hath one that
judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same @ judge him in
the last day.

12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father @ sent me,
he gave me a commandment, what I @# say, and what I @# @K.

12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
I @K @fore, even as the Father said unto me, so I @K.

13:1 Now @	 the feast of the passover, when @ knew that his
hour was come that he @# depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own @ were in the world, he loved them unto the
end.

13:2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the @
of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 13:3 @ knowing that
the Father had @= all @ into his @D, and that he was come
from God, and went to God; 13:4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments; and took a towel, and girded @9.

13:5 After that he poureth @Z into a bason, and began to wash the
disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded.

13:6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter @
 unto him, Lord,
dost thou wash my feet?  13:7 @ @> and said unto him, What I
do thou knowest not now; but thou @ know here@.

13:8 Peter @
 unto him, Thou @ never wash my feet. @
@> him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

13:9 Simon Peter @
 unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
@D and my head.

13:10 @ @
 to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet, but is clean @ whit: and ye are clean, but not all.

13:11 For he knew who @# betray him; @fore said he, Ye are not
all clean.

13:12 So @ he had washed @ feet, and had taken his garments,
and was set down @*, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to
you?  13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
ought to wash one @F's feet.

13:15 For I have @= you an example, that ye @# do as I have
done to you.

13:16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The @< is not @er than
his lord; @" he that is sent @er than he that sent him.

13:17 If ye know @ @, happy are ye if ye do them.

13:18 I @K not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth @d with me hath lifted
up his heel @
 me.

13:19 Now I tell you @	 it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
may believe that I am he.

13:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
me.

13:21 When @ had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you
@ betray me.

13:22 Then the disciples looked one on @F, doubting of whom he
@0.

13:23 Now @ was leaning on @' bosom one of his disciples, whom
@ loved.

13:24 Simon Peter @fore beckoned to him, that he @# ask who it
@# be of whom he @0.

13:25 He then lying on @' breast @
 unto him, Lord, who is it?
13:26 @ @>, He it is, to whom I @ give a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon.

13:27 And @ the sop Satan entered into him. Then said @ unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly.

13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he @0 this unto
him.

13:29 For some of them thought, @ Judas had the bag, that @
had said unto him, Buy @J @ that we have need of @
 the
feast; or, that he @# give some@7 to the poor.

13:30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
night.

13:31 @N, when he was gone out, @ said, Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

13:32 If God be glorified in him, God @ also glorify him in
@9, and @ straightway glorify him.

13:33 Little @, yet a little while I am with you. Ye @ seek
me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now
I say to you.

13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one @F; as
I have loved you, that ye also love one @F.

13:35 By this @ all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
love one to @F.

13:36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? @
@> him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou
@ follow me @wards.

13:37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
lay down my life for thy sake.

13:38 @ @> him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock @ not crow, till thou
hast denied me thrice.

14:1 Let not your @ be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
in me.

14:2 In my Father's @ are many mansions: if it were not so, I
@L have told you. I go to prepare a @' for you.

14:3 And if I go and prepare a @' for you, I will come @*, and
receive you unto myself; that where I am, @ ye may be also.

14:4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

14:5 Thomas @
 unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
how can we know the way?  14:6 @ @
 unto him, I am the way, the
truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

14:7 If ye had known me, ye @# have known my Father also: and from
hence@ ye know him, and have seen him.

14:8 Philip @
 unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.

14:9 @ @
 unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet
hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the
Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?  14:10 Believest
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the @5
that I @K unto you I @K not of myself: but the Father that
dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

14:11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or
else believe me for the very works' sake.

14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
works that I do @ he do also; and @er works than @ @
he do; @ I go unto my Father.

14:13 And whatsoever ye @ ask in my name, that will I do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son.

14:14 If ye @ ask any @7 in my name, I will do it.

14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he @ give you @F
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 14:17 Even the Spirit
of truth; whom the world cannot receive, @ it seeth him not,
@" knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and
@ be in you.

14:18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

14:19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
me: @ I live, ye @ live also.

14:20 At that day ye @ know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
and I in you.

14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me: and he that loveth me @ be loved of my Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

14:22 Judas @
 unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?  14:23 @
@> and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my @5:
and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
abode with him.

14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my @s: and the word @
ye hear is not mine, but the Father's @ sent me.

14:25 These @ have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

14:26 But the Comforter, @ is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, he @ teach you all @, and @( all @
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

14:27 Peace I leave with you, my @U I give unto you: not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your @ be troubled, @"
let it be afraid.

14:28 Ye have @) how I said unto you, I go away, and come @*
unto you. If ye loved me, ye @L rejoice, @ I said, I go unto
the Father: for my Father is @er than I.

14:29 And now I have told you @	 it come to pass, that, when it is
come to pass, ye @B believe.

14:30 Here@ I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
world cometh, and hath no@7 in me.

14:31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

15:2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
@ branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may @(
@ more fruit.

15:3 Now ye are clean @E the word @ I have spoken unto you.

15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
in me.

15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I
in him, the same @(eth @ much fruit: for @S me ye can do
no@7.

15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast @ as a branch, and is
wi@d; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
are burned.

15:7 If ye abide in me, and my @5 abide in you, ye @ ask what
ye will, and it @ be done unto you.

15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so @
ye be my disciples.

15:9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in
my love.

15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye @ abide in my love; even as I
have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

15:11 These @ have I spoken unto you, that my joy @B remain in
you, and that your joy @B be full.

15:12 This is my commandment, That ye love one @F, as I have
loved you.

15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends.

15:14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

15:15 Hence@ I call you not @<s; for the @< knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have @, you friends; for all @
that I have @) of my Father I have made known unto you.

15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
that ye @# go and @( @ fruit, and that your fruit @#
remain: that whatsoever ye @ ask of the Father in my name, he may
give it you.

15:17 These @ I command you, that ye love one @F.

15:18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me @	 it hated
you.

15:19 If ye were of the world, the world @L love his own: but
@ ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
world, @fore the world hateth you.

15:20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The @< is not
@er than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they have kept my @, they will keep yours also.

15:21 But all @ @ will they do unto you for my name's sake,
@ they know not him that sent me.

15:22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
but now they have no cloak for @ sin.

15:23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

15:24 If I had not done @ them the works @ none @C man did,
they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me
and my Father.

15:25 But this cometh to pass, that the word @B be fulfilled that
is written in @ law, They hated me @S a cause.

15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, @ proceedeth from the
Father, he @ testify of me: 15:27 And ye also @ bear witness,
@ ye have been with me from the beginning.

16:1 These @ have I spoken unto you, that ye @# not be
offended.

16:2 They @ put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

16:3 And @ @ will they do unto you, @ they have not
known the Father, nor me.

16:4 But @ @ have I told you, that when the time @ come,
ye may remember that I told you of them. And @ @ I said not
unto you at the beginning, @ I was with you.

16:5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
me, Whither goest thou?  16:6 But @ I have said @ @
unto you, sorrow hath filled your @.

16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
@ceousness, and of judgment: 16:9 Of sin, @ they believe not
on me; 16:10 Of @ceousness, @ I go to my Father, and ye see
me no more; 16:11 Of judgment, @ the prince of this world is
judged.

16:12 I have yet many @ to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.

16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he @ not @K of @9; but whatsoever he
@ hear, that @ he @K: and he will shew you @ to come.

16:14 He @ glorify me: for he @ receive of mine, and @
shew it unto you.

16:15 All @ that the Father hath are mine: @fore said I, that
he @ take of mine, and @ shew it unto you.

16:16 A little while, and ye @ not see me: and @*, a little
while, and ye @ see me, @ I go to the Father.

16:17 Then said some of his disciples @ @T, What is this
that he @
 unto us, A little while, and ye @ not see me: and
@*, a little while, and ye @ see me: and, Because I go to the
Father?  16:18 They said @fore, What is this that he @
, A
little while? we cannot tell what he @
.

16:19 Now @ knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
them, Do ye enquire @ yourselves of that I said, A little while,
and ye @ not see me: and @*, a little while, and ye @ see
me?  16:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye @ weep and
lament, but the world @ rejoice: and ye @ be sorrowful, but
your sorrow @ be turned into joy.

16:21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, @ her hour is
come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no
more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

16:22 And ye now @fore have sorrow: but I will see you @*, and
your @ @ rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

16:23 And in that day ye @ ask me no@7. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye @ ask the Father in my name, he will give
it you.

16:24 Hitherto have ye asked no@7 in my name: ask, and ye @
receive, that your joy may be full.

16:25 These @ have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I @ no more @K unto you in proverbs, but I @
shew you plainly of the Father.

16:26 At that day ye @ ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you: 16:27 For the Father @9
loveth you, @ ye have loved me, and have believed that I came
out from God.

16:28 I came @ from the Father, and am come into the world: @*,
I leave the world, and go to the Father.

16:29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now @Kest thou plainly, and
@Kest no proverb.

16:30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all @, and needest not
that any man @# ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest
@ from God.

16:31 @ @> them, Do ye now believe?  16:32 @., the hour
cometh, yea, is now come, that ye @ be scattered, @ man to his

Father is with me.

16:33 These @ I have spoken unto you, that in me ye @B have
@U.

In the world ye @ have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world.

17:1 These @5 @0 @, and lifted up his eyes to @1, and
said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee: 17:2 As thou hast @= him power over all @R, that
he @# give eternal life to as many as thou hast @= him.

17:3 And this is life eternal, that they @B know thee the only true
God, and @ @2, whom thou hast sent.

17:4 I have glorified thee on the @: I have finished the work
@ thou gavest me to do.

17:5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with @ own self with the
@Y @ I had with thee @	 the world was.

17:6 I have manifested thy name unto the men @ thou gavest me out
of the world: @ they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have
kept thy word.

17:7 Now they have known that all @ whatsoever thou hast @= me
are of thee.

17:8 For I have @= unto them the @5 @ thou gavest me; and
they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from
thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them @
thou hast @= me; for they are @.

17:10 And all mine are @, and @ are mine; and I am glorified
in them.

17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but @ are in the world,
and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep @E @ own name @J
whom thou hast @= me, that they may be one, as we are.

17:12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
@J that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but
the son of perdition; that the scripture @B be fulfilled.

17:13 And now come I to thee; and @ @ I @K in the world,
that they @B have my joy fulfilled in @T.

17:14 I have @= them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
@ they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

17:15 I pray not that thou @#est take them out of the world, but
that thou @#est keep them from the evil.

17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

17:17 Sanctify them @E thy truth: thy word is truth.

17:18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world.

17:19 And for @ sakes I sanctify myself, that they also @B be
sanctified @E the truth.

17:20 Neither pray I for @ alone, but for them also @ @
believe on me @E @ word; 17:21 That they all may be one; as
thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in
us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

17:22 And the @Y @ thou gavest me I have @= them; that they
may be one, even as we are one: 17:23 I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

17:24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast @= me, be with
me where I am; that they may @% my @Y, @ thou hast @=
me: for thou lovedst me @	 the @Vation of the world.

17:25 O @ceous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
known thee, and @ have known that thou hast sent me.

17:26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
them.

18:1 When @ had spoken @ @5, he went @ with his
disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the @ he
entered, and his disciples.

18:2 And Judas also, @ betrayed him, knew the @': for @
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

18:3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the
chief @6s and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons.

18:4 @ @fore, knowing all @ that @# come upon him,
went @, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?  18:5 They @> him,
@ of Nazareth. @ @
 unto them, I am he.

And Judas also, @ betrayed him, stood with them.

18:6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
backward, and fell to the ground.

18:7 Then asked he them @*, Whom seek ye? And they said, @ of
Nazareth.

18:8 @ @>, I have told you that I am he: if @fore ye
seek me, let @ go @ way: 18:9 That the @ @B be
fulfilled, @ he @0, Of them @ thou gavest me have I lost
none.

18:10 Then Simon Peter having a @Q drew it, and smote the high
@6's @<, and cut off his @c ear. The @<'s name was
Malchus.

18:11 Then said @ unto Peter, Put up thy @Q into the sheath:
the cup @ my Father hath @= me, @ I not @b it?  18:12
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took @, and
bound him, 18:13 And led him away to Annas @O; for he was @ in
law to Caiaphas, @ was the high @6 that same year.

18:14 Now Caiaphas was he, @ gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
expedient that one man @# die for the @.

18:15 And Simon Peter followed @, and so did @F disciple:
that disciple was known unto the high @6, and went in with @
into the palace of the high @6.

18:16 But Peter stood at the door @S. Then went out that @C
disciple, @ was known unto the high @6, and @0 unto her
that kept the door, and @ in Peter.

18:17 Then @
 the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
thou also one of this man's disciples? He @
, I am not.

18:18 And the @<s and officers stood @, who had made a fire
of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed @T: and Peter stood
with them, and warmed @9.

18:19 The high @6 then asked @ of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.

18:20 @ @> him, I @0 openly to the world; I ever taught
in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort;
and in secret have I said no@7.

18:21 Why askest thou me? ask them @ @) me, what I have said
unto them: @%, they know what I said.

18:22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers @ stood by
struck @ with the palm of his hand, @, Answerest thou the
high @6 so?  18:23 @ @> him, If I have spoken evil, bear
witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  18:24 Now
Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high @6.

18:25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed @9. They said @fore
unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and
said, I am not.

18:26 One of the @<s of the high @6, being his kinsman whose
ear Peter cut off, @
, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
18:27 Peter then denied @*: and immediately the cock crew.

18:28 Then led they @ from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and
it was early; and they @T went not into the judgment hall,
lest they @# be defiled; but that they @B eat the passover.

18:29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation @(
ye @
 this man?  18:30 They @> and said unto him, If he
were not a malefactor, we @L not have delivered him up unto thee.

18:31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him @$
to your law. The Jews @fore said unto him, It is not lawful for us
to put any man to @^: 18:32 That the @ of @ @B be
fulfilled, @ he @0, signifying what @^ he @# die.

18:33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall @*, and @,
@, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  18:34 @
@> him, Sayest thou this @7 of thyself, or did @Cs tell it
thee of me?  18:35 Pilate @>, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
the chief @6s have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
18:36 @ @>, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
were of this world, then @L my @<s fight, that I @# not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

18:37 Pilate @fore said unto him, Art thou a king then? @
@>, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and
for this cause came I into the world, that I @# bear witness unto
the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my @;.

18:38 Pilate @
 unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
he went out @* unto the Jews, and @
 unto them, I find in him no
fault at all.

18:39 But ye have a custom, that I @# release unto you one at the
passover: will ye @fore that I release unto you the King of the
Jews?  18:40 Then cried they all @*, @, Not this man, but
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

19:1 Then Pilate @fore took @, and scourged him.

19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
head, and they put on him a purple robe, 19:3 And said, Hail, King of
the Jews! and they smote him with @ @D.

19:4 Pilate @fore went @ @*, and @
 unto them, @., I
@( him @ to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

19:5 Then came @ @, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
purple robe. And Pilate @
 unto them, @. the man!  19:6 When
the chief @6s @fore and officers saw him, they cried out,
@, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate @
 unto them, Take ye him,
and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.

19:7 The Jews @> him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
die, @ he made @9 the Son of God.

19:8 When Pilate @fore @) that @, he was the more afraid;
19:9 And went @* into the judgment hall, and @
 unto @,
Whence art thou? But @ gave him no answer.

19:10 Then @
 Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release
thee?  19:11 @ @>, Thou couldest have no power at all
@
 me, except it were @= thee from above: @fore he that
delivered me unto thee hath the @er sin.

19:12 And from thence@ Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
cried out, @, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's
friend: whosoever maketh @9 a king @Keth @
 Caesar.

19:13 When Pilate @fore @) that @, he @ @ @,
and sat down in the judgment seat in a @' that is @, the
Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

19:14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and @+ the sixth
hour: and he @
 unto the Jews, @. your King!  19:15 But they
cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.

Pilate @
 unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief @6s
@>, We have no king but Caesar.

19:16 Then delivered he him @fore unto them to be crucified. And
they took @, and led him away.

19:17 And he bearing his cross went @ into a @' @, the
@' of a skull, @ is @, in the Hebrew Golgotha: 19:18 Where
they crucified him, and two @C with him, on either side one, and
@ in the @a.

19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

19:20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the @' where @
was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and
Greek, and Latin.

19:21 Then said the chief @6s of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

19:22 Pilate @>, What I have written I have written.

19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified @, took his
garments, and made four parts, to @ soldier a part; and also his
coat: now the coat was @S seam, woven from the top @Eout.

19:24 They said @fore @ @T, Let us not rend it, but
cast lots for it, whose it @ be: that the scripture @B be
fulfilled, @ @
, They parted my raiment @ them, and for my
vesture they did cast lots. These @ @fore the soldiers did.

19:25 Now @ stood by the cross of @ his m@C, and his
m@C's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

19:26 When @ @fore saw his m@C, and the disciple standing
by, whom he loved, he @
 unto his m@C, Woman, @% thy son!
19:27 Then @
 he to the disciple, @. thy m@C! And from that
hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

19:28 After this, @ knowing that all @ were now accomplished,
that the scripture @B be fulfilled, @
, I thirst.

19:29 Now @ was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his @P.

19:30 When @ @fore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

19:31 The Jews @fore, @ it was the preparation, that the
bodies @# not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that
sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that @ legs @B be
broken, and that they @B be taken away.

19:32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the @O, and of
the @C @ was crucified with him.

19:33 But when they came to @, and saw that he was dead already,
they brake not his legs: 19:34 But one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side, and @with came @ out @I and @Z.

19:35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
knoweth that he @
 true, that ye @B believe.

19:36 For @ @ were done, that the scripture @# be
fulfilled, A bone of him @ not be broken.

19:37 And @* @F scripture @
, They @ look on him whom
they pierced.

19:38 And @ this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of @,
but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he @B take
away the body of @: and Pilate gave him leave. He came @fore,
and took the body of @.

19:39 And @ came also Nicodemus, @ at the @O came to @
by night, and @ a mixture of myrrh and aloes, @+ an @/
pound weight.

19:40 Then took they the body of @, and wound it in linen clothes
with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

19:41 Now in the @' where he was crucified @ was a garden; and
in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

19:42 There laid they @ @fore @ of the Jews' preparation
day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

20:1 The @O day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre.

20:2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the @C
disciple, whom @ loved, and @
 unto them, They have taken away
the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid
him.

20:3 Peter @fore went @, and that @C disciple, and came to
the sepulchre.

20:4 So they ran both @?: and the @C disciple did outrun
Peter, and came @O to the sepulchre.

20:5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
lying; yet went he not in.

20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 20:7 And the napkin, that
was @+ his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped
@? in a @' by itself.

20:8 Then went in also that @C disciple, @ came @O to the
sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise @*
from the dead.

20:10 Then the disciples went away @* unto @ own home.

20:11 But Mary stood @S at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 20:12 And seeth
two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the @C at the
feet, where the body of @ had lain.

20:13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She @
 unto
them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they
have laid him.

20:14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
@ standing, and knew not that it was @.

20:15 @ @
 unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, @
 unto him, Sir, if
thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I
will take him away.

20:16 @ @
 unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and @
 unto
him, Rabboni; @ is to say, Master.

20:17 @ @
 unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
my Father: but go to my @3, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

20:18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
LORD, and that he had spoken @ @ unto her.

20:19 Then the same day at evening, being the @O day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews, came @ and stood in the @a, and @
 unto them,
Peace be unto you.

20:20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his @D and his
side.

Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.

20:21 Then said @ to them @*, Peace be unto you: as my Father
hath sent me, even so send I you.

20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and @
 unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 20:23 Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
retained.

20:24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, @, Didymus, was not with them
when @ came.

20:25 The @C disciples @fore said unto him, We have seen the
LORD.

But he said unto them, Except I @ see in his @D the print of
the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust
my hand into his side, I will not believe.

20:26 And @ eight days @* his disciples were within, and Thomas
with them: then came @, the doors being shut, and stood in the
@a, and said, Peace be unto you.

20:27 Then @
 he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and @% my
@D; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be
not faithless, but believing.

20:28 And Thomas @> and said unto him, My LORD and my God.

20:29 @ @
 unto him, Thomas, @ thou hast seen me, thou
hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.

20:30 And many @C signs truly did @ in the presence of his
disciples, @ are not written in this book: 20:31 But @ are
written, that ye @B believe that @ is the @2, the Son of
God; and that believing ye @B have life @E his name.

21:1 After @ @ @ shewed @9 @* to the disciples at
the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he @9.

21:2 There were @? Simon Peter, and Thomas @, Didymus, and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two @C
of his disciples.

21:3 Simon Peter @
 unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,
We also go with thee. They went @, and entered into a ship
immediately; and that night they caught no@7.

21:4 But when the morning was now come, @ stood on the shore: but
the disciples knew not that it was @.

21:5 Then @ @
 unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
@> him, No.

21:6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the @c side of the
ship, and ye @ find. They cast @fore, and now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

21:7 @N that disciple whom @ loved @
 unto Peter, It is
the Lord. Now when Simon Peter @) that it was the Lord, he girt his
fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast @9 into
the sea.

21:8 And the @C disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not
far from land, but as it were two @/ cubits,) dragging the net
with fishes.

21:9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
@, and fish laid @on, and @d.

21:10 @ @
 unto them, Bring of the fish @ ye have now
caught.

21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of @
fishes, an @/ and fifty and @@: and for all @ were so
many, yet was not the net broken.

21:12 @ @
 unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

21:13 @ then cometh, and taketh @d, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.

21:14 This is now the third time that @ shewed @9 to his
disciples, @ that he was risen from the dead.

21:15 So when they had dined, @ @
 to Simon Peter, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me more than @? He @
 unto him, Yea,
Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He @
 unto him, Feed my lambs.

21:16 He @
 to him @* the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
lovest thou me? He @
 unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
thee. He @
 unto him, Feed my sheep.

21:17 He @
 unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved @ he said unto him the third time,
Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all @;
thou knowest that I love thee. @ @
 unto him, Feed my sheep.

21:18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou @Lest: but when thou
@ be old, thou @ stretch @ thy @D, and @F @
gird thee, and carry thee whither thou @Lest not.

21:19 This @0 he, signifying by what @^ he @# glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he @
 unto him, Follow me.

21:20 Then Peter, turning @+, seeth the disciple whom @ loved
following; @ also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,
@ is he that betrayeth thee?  21:21 Peter seeing him @
 to
@, Lord, and what @ this man do?  21:22 @ @
 unto him,
If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou
me.

21:23 Then went this @ abroad @ the @3, that that

die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
21:24 This is the disciple @ testifieth of @ @, and wrote
@ @: and we know that his testimony is true.

21:25 And @ are also many @C @ @ @ did, the @,

The Acts of the Apostles


1:1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that @
began both to do and teach, 1:2 Until the day in @ he was taken
up, @ that he @E the Holy Ghost had @= commandments unto
the apostles whom he had chosen: 1:3 To whom also he shewed @9
alive @ his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and @King of the @ pertaining to the kingdom of
God: 1:4 And, being assembled @? with them, @M them that
they @# not depart from @ , but wait for the promise of the
Father, @, @
 he, ye have @) of me.

1:5 For John truly baptized with @Z; but ye @ be baptized with
the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

1:6 When they @fore were come @?, they asked of him, @,
Lord, wilt thou at this time restore @* the kingdom to @?  1:7
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons, @ the Father hath put in his own power.

1:8 But ye @ receive power, @ that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you: and ye @ be witnesses unto me both in @ , and in all
Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the @.

1:9 And when he had spoken @ @, while they beheld, he was
taken up; and a cloud received him out of @ sight.

1:10 And while they looked stedfastly toward @1 as he went up,
@%, two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11 Which also said,
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into @1? this same
@, @ is taken up from you into @1, @ so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into @1.

1:12 Then returned they unto @  from the mount @, Olivet,
@ is from @  a sabbath day's journey.

1:13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and
Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
Zelotes, and Judas the @X of James.

1:14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
with the women, and Mary the m@C of @, and with his @3.

1:15 And in @J days Peter stood up in the @a of the disciples,
and said, (the number of names @? were @+ an @/ and
twenty,) 1:16 Men and @3, this scripture must needs have been
fulfilled, @ the Holy Ghost by the @P of @ @0 @	
concerning Judas, @ was guide to them that took @.

1:17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
ministry.

1:18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst as@[ in the @a, and all his bowels
gushed out.

1:19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at @ ; insomuch as
that field is @, in @ proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,
The field of @I.

1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
desolate, and let no man dwell @in: and his bishoprick let @F
take.

1:21 Wherefore of @ men @ have companied with us all the time
that the Lord @ went in and out @ us, 1:22 Beginning from the
baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must
one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.

1:23 And they appointed two, Joseph @, Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias.

1:24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, @ knowest the @s
of all men, shew whether of @ two thou hast chosen, 1:25 That he
may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from @ Judas by
transgression fell, that he @B go to his own @'.

1:26 And they gave @ @ lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one @'.

2:2 And suddenly @ came a sound from @1 as of a rushing @By
wind, and it filled all the @ where they were sitting.

2:3 And @ appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.

2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to @K
with @C tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

2:5 And @ were dwelling at @  Jews, devout men, out of
@ nation @[ @1.

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came @?, and
were con@Ved, @ that @ man @) them @K in his own
language.

2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, @ one to @F,
@., are not all @ @ @K Galilaeans?  2:8 And how hear we
@ man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  2:9 Parthians, and
Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,
and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in
@-, and in the parts of Libya @+ Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
Jews and proselytes, 2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them @K
in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, @ one to
@F, What meaneth this?  2:13 Others mocking said, These men are
full of new wine.

2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his @;, and
said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at @ ,
be this known unto you, and hearken to my @5: 2:15 For @ are
not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the
day.

2:16 But this is that @ was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17 And
it @ come to pass in the last days, @
 God, I will pour out of
my Spirit upon all @R: and your sons and your daughters @
prophesy, and your young men @ see visions, and your old men @
dream dreams: 2:18 And on my @<s and on my handmaidens I will
pour out in @J days of my Spirit; and they @ prophesy: 2:19 And
I will shew wonders in @1 above, and signs in the @ beneath;
@I, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 2:20 The sun @ be turned
into darkness, and the moon into @I, @	 the @ and notable
day of the Lord come: 2:21 And it @ come to pass, that whosoever
@ call on the name of the Lord @ be saved.

2:22 Ye men of @, hear @ @5; @ of Nazareth, a man
approved of God @ you by miracles and wonders and signs, @ God
did by him in the @a of you, as ye yourselves also know: 2:23 Him,
being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,
ye have taken, and by wicked @D have crucified and slain: 2:24 Whom
God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of @^: @ it was
not possible that he @# be holden of it.

2:25 For @ @Keth concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
@	 my face, for he is on my @c hand, that I @# not be
moved: 2:26 @N did my @ rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
moreover also my @R @ rest in hope: 2:27 Because thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell, @" wilt thou suffer @ Holy One to see
corruption.

2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou @ make me
full of joy with thy countenance.

2:29 Men and @3, let me freely @K unto you of the patriarch
@, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us
unto this day.

2:30 @N being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, @$ to the @R,
he @L raise up @2 to sit on his throne; 2:31 He seeing this
@	 @0 of the resurrection of @2, that his soul was not left
in hell, @" his @R did see corruption.

2:32 This @ hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

2:33 @N being by the @c hand of God exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
@ this, @ ye now see and hear.

2:34 For @ is not ascended into the @1s: but he @
 @9,
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my @c hand, 2:35 Until I
make thy foes thy footstool.

2:36 @N let all the @ of @ know assuredly, that God
hath made the same @, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
@2.

2:37 Now when they @) this, they were pricked in @ @, and
said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and @3,
what @ we do?  2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be
baptized @ one of you in the name of @ @2 for the
remission of sins, and ye @ receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your @, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God @ call.

2:40 And with many @C @5 did he testify and exhort, @, Save
yourselves from this untoward generation.

2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
same day @ were added unto them @+ @@ @: souls.

2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of @d, and in prayers.

2:43 And fear came upon @ soul: and many wonders and signs were
done by the apostles.

2:44 And all that believed were @?, and had all @ common;
2:45 And sold @ possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
as @ man had need.

2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking @d from @ to @, did eat @ meat with gladness
and singleness of @, 2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all
the @. And the Lord added to the church daily such as @# be
saved.

3:1 Now Peter and John went up @? into the temple at the hour of
prayer, being the ninth hour.

3:2 And a certain man lame from his m@C's womb was carried, whom
they laid daily at the gate of the temple @ is @, Beautiful,
to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 3:3 Who seeing Peter
and John @+ to go into the temple asked an alms.

3:4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on
us.

3:5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive some@7 of
them.

3:6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
give I thee: In the name of @ @2 of Nazareth rise up and walk.

3:7 And he took him by the @c hand, and lifted him up: and
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

3:8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into
the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

3:9 And all the @ saw him walking and praising God: 3:10 And they
knew that it was he @ sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the
temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that @
had happened unto him.

3:11 And as the lame man @ was healed held Peter and John, all the
@ ran @? unto them in the porch that is @, Solomon's,
@ly wondering.

3:12 And when Peter saw it, he @> unto the @, Ye men of
@, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
3:13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of @], the God of our
@s, hath glorified his Son @; whom ye delivered up, and
denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let
him go.

3:14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you; 3:15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God
hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.

3:16 And his name @E faith in his name hath made this man strong,
whom ye see and know: yea, the faith @ is by him hath @= him
this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

3:17 And now, @3, I wot that @E ignorance ye did it, as did
also your rulers.

3:18 But @J @, @ God @	 had shewed by the @P of all
his prophets, that @2 @# suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

3:19 Repent ye @fore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out, when the times of refreshing @ come from the presence
of the Lord.

3:20 And he @ send @ @2, @ @	 was preached unto
you: 3:21 Whom the @1 must receive until the times of restitution
of all @, @ God hath spoken by the @P of all his holy
prophets since the world began.

3:22 For @ truly said unto the @s, A prophet @ the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your @3, like unto me; him @
ye hear in all @ whatsoever he @ say unto you.

3:23 And it @ come to pass, that @ soul, @ will not hear
that prophet, @ be destroyed from @ the @.

3:24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and @J that follow
@, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of @ days.

3:25 Ye are the @ of the prophets, and of the covenant @
God made with our @s, @ unto Abraham, And in thy seed @
all the kindreds of the @ be blessed.

3:26 Unto you @O God, having raised up his Son @, sent him to
bless you, in turning away @ one of you from his iniquities.

4:1 And as they @0 unto the @, the @6s, and the captain of
the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 4:2 Being grieved that
they taught the @, and preached @E @ the resurrection
from the dead.

4:3 And they laid @D on them, and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it was now eventide.

4:4 Howbeit many of them @ @) the word believed; and the number
of the men was @+ five @:.

4:5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that @ rulers, and elders,
and scribes, 4:6 And Annas the high @6, and Caiaphas, and John,
and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high @6,
were ga@d @? at @ .

4:7 And when they had set them in the @a, they asked, By what
power, or by what name, have ye done this?  4:8 Then Peter, filled
with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the @, and
elders of @, 4:9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done
to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 4:10 Be it known
unto you all, and to all the @ of @, that by the name of
@ @2 of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, even by him doth this man stand here @	 you whole.

4:11 This is the stone @ was set at nought of you builders, @
is become the head of the corner.

4:12 Neither is @ salvation in any @C: for @ is none @C
name @[ @1 @= @ men, whereby we must be saved.

4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they
took knowledge of them, that they had been with @.

4:14 And @%ing the man @ was healed standing with them, they
could say no@7 @
 it.

4:15 But when they had @M them to go aside out of the council,
they conferred @ @T, 4:16 Saying, What @ we do to
@ men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in @ ; and we cannot deny it.

4:17 But that it spread no further @ the @, let us straitly
threaten them, that they @K hence@ to no man in this name.

4:18 And they @, them, and @M them not to @K at all nor
teach in the name of @.

4:19 But Peter and John @> and said unto them, Whether it be
@c in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye.

4:20 For we cannot but @K the @ @ we have seen and @).

4:21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
finding no@7 how they @B punish them, @ of the @: for
all men glorified God for that @ was done.

4:22 For the man was above forty @8 old, on whom this miracle of
healing was shewed.

4:23 And being let go, they went to @ own company, and reported
all that the chief @6s and elders had said unto them.

4:24 And when they @) that, they lifted up @ @; to God with
one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, @ hast made @1, and
@, and the sea, and all that in them is: 4:25 Who by the @P of
thy @< @ hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the @
imagine vain @?  4:26 The kings of the @ stood up, and the
rulers were ga@d @? @
 the Lord, and @
 his
@2.

4:27 For of a truth @
 thy holy child @, whom thou hast
anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the
@ of @, were ga@d @?, 4:28 For to do whatsoever
thy hand and thy counsel determined @	 to be done.

4:29 And now, Lord, @% @ threatenings: and grant unto thy
@<s, that with all boldness they may @K thy word, 4:30 By
stretching @ @ hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be
done by the name of thy holy child @.

4:31 And when they had prayed, the @' was shaken where they were
assembled @?; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
they @0 the word of God with boldness.

4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one @ and of
one soul: @" said any of them that ought of the @ @ he
possessed was his own; but they had all @ common.

4:33 And with @ power gave the apostles witness of the
resurrection of the Lord @: and @ grace was upon them all.

4:34 Neither was @ any @ them that lacked: for as many as were
possessors of lands or @s sold them, and @ the prices of the
@ that were sold, 4:35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet:
and distribution was made unto @ man @$ as he had need.

4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (@ is,
being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the
country of Cyprus, 4:37 Having land, sold it, and @ the money,
and laid it at the apostles' feet.

5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession, 5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being
privy to it, and @ a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'
feet.

5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled @ @ to lie
to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not @ own? and @ it was sold,
was it not in @ own power? why hast thou conceived this @7 in
@ @?  thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

5:5 And Ananias hearing @ @5 fell down, and gave up the ghost:
and @ fear came on all them that @) @ @.

5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
buried him.

5:7 And it was @+ the space of @@ hours @, when his wife,
not knowing what was done, came in.

5:8 And Peter @> unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed @?
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? @%, the feet of them @ have
buried thy husband are at the door, and @ carry thee out.

5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
ghost: and the young men came in, and @V her dead, and, carrying
her @, buried her by her husband.

5:11 And @ fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
@) @ @.

5:12 And by the @D of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought @ the @; (and they were all with one accord in
Solomon's porch.

5:13 And of the rest durst no man join @9 to them: but the @
magnified them.

5:14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
men and women.)  5:15 Insomuch that they @ @ the sick into
the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the
shadow of Peter passing by @B overshadow some of them.

5:16 There came also a multitude out of the @G round @+ unto
@ , @(ing sick folks, and them @ were vexed with unclean
spirits: and they were healed @ one.

5:17 Then the high @6 rose up, and all they that were with him,
(@ is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
indignation, 5:18 And laid @ @D on the apostles, and put them
in the common prison.

5:19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
@ them @, and said, 5:20 Go, stand and @K in the temple
to the @ all the @5 of this life.

5:21 And when they @) that, they entered into the temple early in
the morning, and taught. But the high @6 came, and they that were
with him, and @, the council @?, and all the senate of the
@ of @, and sent to the prison to have them @.

5:22 But when the officers came, and @V them not in the prison,
they returned and told, 5:23 Saying, The prison truly @V we shut
with all safety, and the keepers standing @S @	 the doors:
but when we had opened, we @V no man within.

5:24 Now when the high @6 and the captain of the temple and the
chief @6s @) @ @, they doubted of them whereunto this
@L grow.

5:25 Then came one and told them, @, @., the men whom ye put
in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the @.

5:26 Then went the captain with the officers, and @ them @S
violence: for they feared the @, lest they @# have been
stoned.

5:27 And when they had @ them, they set them @	 the council:
and the high @6 asked them, 5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly
command you that ye @# not teach in this name? and, @%, ye
have filled @  with your doctrine, and intend to @( this
man's @I upon us.

5:29 Then Peter and the @C apostles @> and said, We ought to
obey God rather than men.

5:30 The God of our @s raised up @, whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree.

5:31 Him hath God exalted with his @c hand to be a Prince and a
Saviour, for to give repentance to @, and for@=ess of sins.

5:32 And we are his witnesses of @ @; and so is also the Holy
Ghost, whom God hath @= to them that obey him.

5:33 When they @) that, they were cut to the @, and took
counsel to slay them.

5:34 Then stood @ up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation @ all the @,
and @M to put the apostles @ a little space; 5:35 And said
unto them, Ye men of @, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to
do as touching @ men.

5:36 For @	 @ days rose up Theudas, boasting @9 to be
somebody; to whom a number of men, @+ four @/, joined
@T: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
scattered, and @ to nought.

5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
taxing, and drew away much @ @ him: he also perished; and
all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from @ men, and let them
alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to
nought: 5:39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply
ye be @V even to fight @
 God.

5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had @, the apostles,
and beaten them, they @M that they @# not @K in the name
of @, and let them go.

5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

5:42 And daily in the temple, and in @ @, they ceased not to
teach and preach @ @2.

6:1 And in @J days, when the number of the disciples was
multiplied, @ arose a murmuring of the Grecians @
 the
Hebrews, @ @ widows were neglected in the daily
ministration.

6:2 Then the twelve @, the multitude of the disciples unto them,
and said, It is not reason that we @# leave the word of God, and
serve tables.

6:3 Wherefore, @3, look ye out @ you @H men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over
this business.

6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word.

6:5 And the @ pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a
proselyte of Antioch: 6:6 Whom they set @	 the apostles: and when
they had prayed, they laid @ @D on them.

6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
multiplied in @  @ly; and a @ company of the @6s
were obedient to the faith.

6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did @ wonders and
miracles @ the @.

6:9 Then @ arose certain of the synagogue, @ is @, the
synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of
them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

6:10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
@ he @0.

6:11 Then they suborned men, @ said, We have @) him @K
blasphemous @5 @
 @, and @
 God.

6:12 And they stirred up the @, and the elders, and the scribes,
and came upon him, and caught him, and @ him to the council,
6:13 And set up false witnesses, @ said, This man ceaseth not to
@K blasphemous @5 @
 this holy @', and the law: 6:14 For
we have @) him say, that this @ of Nazareth @ destroy this
@', and @ change the customs @ @ delivered us.

6:15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw
his face as it had been the face of an angel.

7:1 Then said the high @6, Are @ @ so?  7:2 And he said,
Men, @3, and @s, hearken; The God of @Y appeared unto
our @ Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, @	 he dwelt in
Charran, 7:3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and come into the land @ I @ shew thee.

7:4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
Charran: and from thence, when his @ was dead, he removed him
into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

7:5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
his foot on: yet he promised that he @L give it to him for a
possession, and to his seed @ him, when as yet he had no child.

7:6 And God @0 on this wise, That his seed @# sojourn in a
strange land; and that they @# @( them into bondage, and
entreat them evil four @/ @8.

7:7 And the nation to whom they @ be in bondage will I judge, said
God: and @ that @ they come @, and serve me in this @'.

7:8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat @]; and
@] begat the twelve patriarchs.

7:9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into @-: but
God was with him, 7:10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions,
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of @-;
and he made him governor over @- and all his @.

7:11 Now @ came a d@ over all the land of @- and Chanaan,
and @ affliction: and our @s @V no sustenance.

7:12 But when @] @) that @ was corn in @-, he sent out
our @s @O.

7:13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his @3; and
Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

7:14 Then sent Joseph, and @, his @ @] to him, and all his
kindred, @@score and fifteen souls.

7:15 So @] went down into @-, and died, he, and our @s,
7:16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the @ of
Sychem.

7:17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, @ God had sworn
to Abraham, the @ grew and multiplied in @-, 7:18 Till @F
king arose, @ knew not Joseph.

7:19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
@s, so that they cast out @ young @, to the end they
@B not live.

7:20 In @ time @ was born, and was exceeding fair, and
nourished up in his @'s @ @@ months: 7:21 And when he was
cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her
own son.

7:22 And @ was learned in all the wisdom of the @-ians, and was
@By in @5 and in deeds.

7:23 And when he was full forty @8 old, it came into his @ to
visit his @3 the @ of @.

7:24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
him that was oppressed, and smote the @-ian: 7:25 For he supposed
his @3 @L have @[stood how that God by his hand @L
deliver them: but they @[stood not.

7:26 And the next day he shewed @9 unto them as they strove, and
@L have set them at one @*, @, Sirs, ye are @3; why
do ye wrong one to @F?  7:27 But he that did his neighbour wrong
thrust him away, @, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the @-ian yesterday?  7:29
Then fled @ at this @, and was a stranger in the land of
Madian, where he begat two sons.

7:30 And when forty @8 were expired, @ appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
bush.

7:31 When @ saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
to @% it, the @; of the LORD came unto him, 7:32 Saying, I am
the God of thy @s, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of @]. Then @ trembled, and durst not @%.

7:33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for
the @' where thou standest is holy ground.

7:34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my @ @ is in
@-, and I have @) @ groaning, and am come down to deliver

7:35 This @ whom they refused, @, Who made thee a ruler and a

of the angel @ appeared to him in the bush.

7:36 He @ them out, @ that he had shewed wonders and signs
in the land of @-, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty
@8.

7:37 This is that @, @ said unto the @ of @, A
prophet @ the Lord your God raise up unto you of your @3,
like unto me; him @ ye hear.

7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
angel @ @0 to him in the mount Sina, and with our @s: who
received the lively oracles to give unto us: 7:39 To whom our @s
@L not obey, but thrust him from them, and in @ @s turned

@	 us: for as for this @, @ @ us out of the land of

7:41 And they made a calf in @J days, and offered sacrifice unto
the idol, and rejoiced in the works of @ own @D.

7:42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of @1;
as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye @ of @,
have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of
forty @8 in the wilderness?  7:43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of
Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures @ ye made to
worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

7:44 Our @s had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as

7:45 Which also our @s that came @ @ in with @ into

7:47 But Solomon built him an @.

7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with @D; as
@
 the prophet, 7:49 Heaven is my throne, and @ is my

 the Lord: or what is the

Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in @ and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as your @s did, so do ye.

7:52 Which of the prophets have not your @s persecuted? and they
have slain them @ shewed @	 of the coming of the Just One; of
whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 7:53 Who have
received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.

7:54 When they @) @ @, they were cut to the @, and
they gnashed on him with @ teeth.

7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
@1, and saw the @Y of God, and @ standing on the @c hand
of God, 7:56 And said, @., I see the @1s opened, and the Son
of man standing on the @c hand of God.

7:57 Then they cried out with a loud @;, and stopped @ ears,
and ran upon him with one accord, 7:58 And cast him out of the city,
and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down @ clothes at a young
man's feet, whose name was Saul.

7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and @, Lord
@, receive my spirit.

7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud @;, Lord, lay not
this sin to @ charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his @^. And at that time @ was
a @ persecution @
 the church @ was at @ ; and
they were all scattered abroad @Eout the regions of Judaea and
Samaria, except the apostles.

8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made @
lamentation over him.

8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into @
@, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

8:4 @N they that were scattered abroad went @ where
preaching the word.

8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached @2
unto them.

8:6 And the @ with one accord gave heed unto @J @ @
Philip @0, hearing and seeing the miracles @ he did.

8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud @;, came out of many that
were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were
lame, were healed.

8:8 And @ was @ joy in that city.

8:9 But @ was a certain man, @, Simon, @ @	time in the
same city used sorcery, and bewitched the @ of Samaria, giving
out that @9 was some @ one: 8:10 To whom they all gave heed,
from the least to the @est, @, This man is the @ power of
God.

8:11 And to him they had regard, @ that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries.

8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the @ concerning the
kingdom of God, and the name of @ @2, they were baptized, both
men and women.

8:13 Then Simon @9 believed also: and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and wondered, @%ing the miracles and signs
@ were done.

8:14 Now when the apostles @ were at @  @) that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 8:15
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they @B
receive the Holy Ghost: 8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of
them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord @.)  8:17
Then laid they @ @D on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

8:18 And when Simon saw that @E laying on of the apostles' @D
the Holy Ghost was @=, he offered them money, 8:19 Saying, Give me
also this power, that on whomsoever I lay @D, he may receive the
Holy Ghost.

8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, @ thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

8:21 Thou hast @" part nor lot in this matter: for thy @ is
not @c in the sight of God.

8:22 Repent @fore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
the thought of @ @ may be for@= thee.

8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in

8:24 Then @> Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
none of @ @ @ ye have spoken come upon me.

8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord, returned to @ , and preached the gospel in many villages
of the Samaritans.

8:26 And the angel of the Lord @0 unto Philip, @, Arise, and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from @  unto
Gaza, @ is desert.

8:27 And he arose and went: and, @%, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
of @ authority @[ Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
charge of all her treasure, and had come to @  for to worship,
8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet.

8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
this chariot.

8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and @) him read the prophet
Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  8:31 And he
said, How can I, except some man @# guide me? And he desired
Philip that he @L come up and sit with him.

8:32 The @' of the scripture @ he read was this, He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb @	 his shearer, so
opened he not his @P: 8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was
taken away: and who @ declare his generation? for his life is
taken from the @.

8:34 And the eunuch @> Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
@Keth the prophet this? of @9, or of some @C man?  8:35
Then Philip opened his @P, and began at the same scripture, and
preached unto him @.

8:36 And as they went on @ way, they came unto a certain @Z:
and the eunuch said, See, here is @Z; what doth hinder me to be
baptized?  8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all @
@, thou mayest.

And he @> and said, I believe that @ @2 is the Son of
God.

8:38 And he @M the chariot to stand still: and they went down
both into the @Z, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

8:39 And when they were come up out of the @Z, the Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went
on his way rejoicing.

8:40 But Philip was @V at Azotus: and passing @E he preached
in all the @G, till he came to Caesarea.

9:1 And Saul, yet brea@7 out threatenings and slaughter @
 the
disciples of the Lord, went unto the high @6, 9:2 And desired of
him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he @V any of
this way, whether they were men or women, he @B @( them bound

9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly @
shined round @+ him a light from @1: 9:4 And he fell to the
@, and @) a @; @ unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?  9:5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am
@ whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick @
 the
pricks.

9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it
@ be told thee what thou must do.

9:7 And the men @ journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a

9:8 And Saul arose from the @; and when his eyes were opened, he
saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and @ him into
Damascus.

9:9 And he was @@ days @S sight, and @" did eat nor

9:10 And @ was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, @., I am
here, Lord.

9:11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street @
is @, Straight, and enquire in the @ of Judas for one @,
Saul, of Tarsus: for, @%, he prayeth, 9:12 And hath seen in a

that he @B receive his sight.

9:13 Then Ananias @>, Lord, I have @) by many of this man,
how much evil he hath done to thy saints at @ : 9:14 And here
he hath authority from the chief @6s to bind all that call on thy
name.

9:15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
unto me, to bear my name @	 the Gentiles, and kings, and the
@ of @: 9:16 For I will shew him how @ @ he must

9:17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the @; and putting
his @D on him said, Br@C Saul, the Lord, even @, that
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
@Best receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

9:18 And immediately @ fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
and he received sight @with, and arose, and was baptized.

9:19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
certain days with the disciples @ were at Damascus.

9:20 And straightway he preached @2 in the synagogues, that he is
the Son of God.

9:21 But all that @) him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
destroyed them @ @, on this name in @ , and came hither
for that intent, that he @B @( them bound unto the chief
@6s?  9:22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and con@Ved
the Jews @ dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very @2.

9:23 And @ that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
kill him: 9:24 But @ laying await was known of Saul. And they
watched the gates day and night to kill him.

9:25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
wall in a basket.

9:26 And when Saul was come to @ , he assayed to join @9
to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not
that he was a disciple.

9:27 But Barnabas took him, and @ him to the apostles, and
declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he
had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the
name of @.

9:28 And he was with them coming in and going out at @ .

9:29 And he @0 boldly in the name of the Lord @, and disputed
@
 the Grecians: but they went @+ to slay him.

9:30 Which when the @3 knew, they @ him down to Caesarea,
and sent him @ to Tarsus.

9:31 Then had the churches rest @Eout all Judaea and Galilee and
Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

9:32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed @Eout all quarters, he
came down also to the saints @ dwelt at Lydda.

9:33 And @ he @V a certain man named Aeneas, @ had kept his
bed eight @8, and was sick of the palsy.

9:34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, @ @2 maketh thee whole:
arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

9:35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
Lord.

9:36 Now @ was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, @ by
interpretation is @, Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds @ she did.

9:37 And it came to pass in @J days, that she was sick, and died:
whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.

9:38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
@) that Peter was @, they sent unto him two men, desiring him
that he @L not delay to come to them.

9:39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
@ him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him
weeping, and shewing the coats and garments @ Dorcas made, while
she was with them.

9:40 But Peter put them all @, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes:
and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

9:41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
@, the saints and widows, presented her alive.

9:42 And it was known @Eout all Joppa; and many believed in the
Lord.

9:43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
Simon a tanner.

10:1 There was a certain man in Caesarea @, Cornelius, a centurion
of the band @, the Italian band, 10:2 A devout man, and one that
feared God with all his @, @ gave much alms to the @, and
prayed to God alway.

10:3 He saw in a vision evidently @+ the ninth hour of the day an
angel of God coming in to him, and @ unto him, Cornelius.

10:4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,
Lord?  And he said unto him, Thy prayers and @ alms are come up
for a memorial @	 God.

10:5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
is Peter: 10:6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose @ is by
the sea side: he @ tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

10:7 And when the angel @ @0 unto Cornelius was departed, he
@, two of his @hold @<s, and a devout soldier of them
that waited on him continually; 10:8 And when he had declared all
@ @ unto them, he sent them to Joppa.

10:9 On the morrow, as they went on @ journey, and drew nigh unto
the city, Peter went up upon the @top to pray @+ the sixth
hour: 10:10 And he became very hungry, and @L have eaten: but while
they made ready, he fell into a trance, 10:11 And saw @1 opened,
and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a @ sheet
knit at the four corners, and let down to the @: 10:12 Wherein
were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the @, and wild beasts,
and creeping @, and fowls of the air.

10:13 And @ came a @; to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

10:14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any @7
that is common or unclean.

10:15 And the @; @0 unto him @* the second time, What God
hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

10:16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up @* into
@1.

10:17 Now while Peter doubted in @9 what this vision @ he had
seen @# mean, @%, the men @ were sent from Cornelius had
made enquiry for Simon's @, and stood @	 the gate, 10:18 And
@,, and asked whether Simon, @ was surnamed Peter, were lodged
@.

10:19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
@., @@ men seek thee.

10:20 Arise @fore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
no@7: for I have sent them.

10:21 Then Peter went down to the men @ were sent unto him from
Cornelius; and said, @., I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause
wherefore ye are come?  10:22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion,
a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report @ all the
nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
thee into his @, and to hear @5 of thee.

10:23 Then @, he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
went away with them, and certain @3 from Joppa accompanied him.

10:24 And the morrow @ they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
waited for them, and he had @, @? his kinsmen and near
friends.

10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at
his feet, and worshipped him.

10:26 But Peter took him up, @, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and @V many that were
come @?.

10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful @7
for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of @F
nation; but God hath shewed me that I @# not call any man common
or unclean.

10:29 @N came I unto you @S gain@, as soon as I was
sent for: I ask @fore for what intent ye have sent for me?  10:30
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and
at the ninth hour I prayed in my @, and, @%, a man stood
@	 me in b@c clo@7, 10:31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is
@), and @ alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.

10:32 Send @fore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
Peter; he is lodged in the @ of one Simon a tanner by the sea

10:33 Immediately @fore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
that thou art come. Now @fore are we all here present @	 God,
to hear all @ that are @M thee of God.

10:34 Then Peter opened his @P, and said, Of a truth I perceive
that God is no respecter of persons: 10:35 But in @ nation he that
feareth him, and worketh @ceousness, is accepted with him.

10:36 The word @ God sent unto the @ of @, preaching
@U by @ @2: (he is Lord of all:) 10:37 That word, I say, ye

was with him.

10:39 And we are witnesses of all @ @ he did both in the land
of the Jews, and in @ ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41
Not to all the @, but unto witnesses chosen @	 God, even to
us, who did eat and @b with him @ he rose from the dead.

10:42 And he @M us to preach unto the @, and to testify
that it is he @ was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and
dead.

10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that @E his name
whosoever believeth in him @ receive remission of sins.

10:44 While Peter yet @0 @ @5, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them @ @) the word.

10:45 And they of the circumcision @ believed were astonished, as
many as came with Peter, @ that on the Gentiles also was poured
out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

10:46 For they @) them @K with tongues, and magnify God. Then
@> Peter, 10:47 Can any man forbid @Z, that @ @# not
be baptized, @ have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  10:48
And he @M them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then
prayed they him to tarry certain days.

11:1 And the apostles and @3 that were in Judaea @) that the
Gentiles had also received the word of God.

11:2 And when Peter was come up to @ , they that were of the
circumcision contended with him, 11:3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.

11:4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
it by order unto them, @, 11:5 I was in the city of Joppa
praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as
it had been a @ sheet, let down from @1 by four corners; and
it came even to me: 11:6 Upon the @ when I had fastened mine eyes,
I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the @, and wild beasts,
and creeping @, and fowls of the air.

11:7 And I @) a @; @ unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.

11:8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for no@7 common or unclean hath at
any time entered into my @P.

11:9 But the @; @> me @* from @1, What God hath

11:10 And this was done @@ times: and all were drawn up @* into
@1.

11:11 And, @%, immediately @ were @@ men already come unto
the @ where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

11:12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, no@7 doubting. Moreover
@ six @3 accompanied me, and we entered into the man's
@: 11:13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his @,
@ stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,
whose surname is Peter; 11:14 Who @ tell thee @5, whereby thou
and all thy @ @ be saved.

11:15 And as I began to @K, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
at the beginning.

11:16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
indeed baptized with @Z; but ye @ be baptized with the Holy
Ghost.

11:17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,
who believed on the Lord @ @2; what was I, that I could
withstand God?  11:18 When they @) @ @, they held @
@U, and glorified God, @, Then hath God also to the Gentiles

11:19 Now they @ were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
arose @+ Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and
Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

11:20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, @, when they
were come to Antioch, @0 unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD
@.

11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a @ number
believed, and turned unto the Lord.

11:22 Then tidings of @ @ came unto the ears of the church
@ was in @ : and they sent @ Barnabas, that he @#
go as far as Antioch.

11:23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
exhorted them all, that with purpose of @ they @L cleave unto
the Lord.

11:24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
and much @ was added unto the Lord.

11:25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26 And
when he had @V him, he @ him unto Antioch. And it came to
pass, that a whole year they assembled @T with the church, and
taught much @. And the disciples were @, @2ians @O in
Antioch.

11:27 And in @ days came prophets from @  unto Antioch.

11:28 And @ stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
the Spirit that @ @# be @ d@ @Eout all the world:
@ came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

11:29 Then the disciples, @ man @$ to his ability,
determined to send relief unto the @3 @ dwelt in Judaea:
11:30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the @D of
Barnabas and Saul.

12:1 Now @+ that time Herod the king stretched @ his @D to
vex certain of the church.

12:2 And he killed James the @X of John with the @Q.

12:3 And @ he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened @d.)  12:4 And
when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him
to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending @ Easter to
@( him @ to the @.

12:5 Peter @fore was kept in prison: but prayer was made @S
ceasing of the church unto God for him.

12:6 And when Herod @L have @ him @, the same night Peter
was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the
keepers @	 the door kept the prison.

12:7 And, @%, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him
up, @, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his @D.

12:8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
sandals.

And so he did. And he @
 unto him, Cast thy garment @+ thee, and
follow me.

12:9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
@ was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

12:10 When they were past the @O and the second ward, they came
unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; @ opened to them of
his own accord: and they went out, and passed on @E one street;
and @with the angel departed from him.

12:11 And when Peter was come to @9, he said, Now I know of a
surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out
of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the @ of
the Jews.

12:12 And when he had considered the @7, he came to the @ of
Mary the m@C of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were
ga@d @? praying.

12:13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
hearken, named Rhoda.

12:14 And when she knew Peter's @;, she opened not the gate for
gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood @	 the gate.

12:15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

12:16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,
and saw him, they were astonished.

12:17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold @ @U,
declared unto them how the Lord had @ him out of the prison. And
he said, Go shew @ @ unto James, and to the @3. And he
departed, and went into @F @'.

12:18 Now as soon as it was day, @ was no small stir @ the
soldiers, what was become of Peter.

12:19 And when Herod had sought for him, and @V him not, he
examined the keepers, and @M that they @# be put to @^.
And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and @ abode.

12:20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's
chamberlain @ friend, desired @U; @ @ country was
nourished by the king's country.

12:21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
throne, and made an oration unto them.

12:22 And the @ gave a shout, @, It is the @; of a god,
and not of a man.

12:23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, @ he gave
not God the @Y: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

12:24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from @ , when they had
fulfilled @ ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was
Mark.

13:1 Now @ were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was @, Niger, and
Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, @ had been @ up with Herod the
tetrarch, and Saul.

13:2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have @,
them.

13:3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid @ @D on
them, they sent them away.

13:4 So they, being sent @ by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

13:5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to @ minister.

13:6 And when they had gone @E the isle unto Paphos, they @V a
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:
13:7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
prudent man; who @, for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the
word of God.

13:8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

13:9 Then Saul, (who also is @, Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,
set his eyes on him.

13:10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of
the devil, thou enemy of all @ceousness, wilt thou not cease to
pervert the @c ways of the Lord?  13:11 And now, @%, the hand
of the Lord is upon thee, and thou @ be blind, not seeing the sun
for a season. And immediately @ fell on him a mist and a darkness;
and he went @+ seeking some to lead him by the hand.

13:12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

13:13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to
@ .

13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

13:15 And @ the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent unto them, @, Ye men and @3, if ye have
any word of exhortation for the @, say on.

13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
@, and ye that fear God, give audience.

13:17 The God of this @ of @ chose our @s, and exalted
the @ when they dwelt as strangers in the land of @-, and with
an high arm @ he them out of it.

13:18 And @+ the time of forty @8 suffered he @ manners in
the wilderness.

13:19 And when he had destroyed @H nations in the land of Chanaan,
he divided @ land to them by lot.

13:20 And @ that he gave unto them judges @+ the space of four
@/ and fifty @8, until Samuel the prophet.

13:21 And @ward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty
@8.

13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them @ to be
@ king; to whom also he gave @ testimony, and said, I have
@V @ the son of Jesse, a man @ mine own @, @ @
fulfil all my will.

13:23 Of this man's seed hath God @$ to his promise raised unto
@ a Saviour, @: 13:24 When John had @O preached @	 his
coming the baptism of repentance to all the @ of @.

13:25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I
am?  I am not he. But, @%, @ cometh one @ me, whose shoes
of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

13:26 Men and @3, @ of the stock of Abraham, and
whosoever @ you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation
sent.

13:27 For they that dwell at @ , and @ rulers, @ they
knew him not, nor yet the @;s of the prophets @ are read @
sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.

13:28 And though they @V no cause of @^ in him, yet desired they
Pilate that he @# be slain.

13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

13:30 But God raised him from the dead: 13:31 And he was seen many
days of them @ came up with him from Galilee to @ , who are
his witnesses unto the @.

13:32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise @
was made unto the @s, 13:33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us
@ @, in that he hath raised up @ @*; as it is also
written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee.

13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you
the sure mercies of @.

13:35 Wherefore he @
 also in @F psalm, Thou @ not suffer
@ Holy One to see corruption.

13:36 For @, @ he had served his own generation by the will of
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his @s, and saw corruption:
13:37 But he, whom God raised @*, saw no corruption.

13:38 Be it known unto you @fore, men and @3, that @E
this man is preached unto you the for@=ess of sins: 13:39 And by
him all that believe are justified from all @, from @ ye
could not be justified by the law of @.

13:40 Beware @fore, lest that come upon you, @ is spoken of in
the prophets; 13:41 @., ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for
I work a work in your days, a work @ ye @ in no wise believe,
though a man declare it unto you.

13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that @ @5 @B be preached to them the next sabbath.

13:43 Now when the @` was broken up, many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, @King to
them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city @? to
hear the word of God.

13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
envy, and @0 @
 @J @ @ were spoken by Paul,
contradicting and blaspheming.

13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
that the word of God @# @O have been spoken to you: but seeing
ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

13:47 For so hath the Lord @M us, @, I have set thee to be
a light of the Gentiles, that thou @#est be for salvation unto the
ends of the @.

13:48 And when the Gentiles @) this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed.

13:49 And the word of the Lord was published @Eout all the
region.

13:50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
chief men of the city, and raised persecution @
 Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of @ coasts.

13:51 But they shook off the dust of @ feet @
 them, and came
unto Iconium.

13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

14:1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both @? into
the synagogue of the Jews, and so @0, that a @ multitude both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made @
minds evil affected @
 the @3.

14:3 Long time @fore abode they @King boldly in the Lord, @
gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and
wonders to be done by @ @D.

14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the
Jews, and part with the apostles.

14:5 And when @ was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
of the Jews with @ rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone
them, 14:6 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe,
@G of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round @+: 14:7
And @ they preached the gospel.

14:8 And @ sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
being a cripple from his m@C's womb, who never had walked: 14:9 The
same @) Paul @K: who stedfastly @%ing him, and perceiving
that he had faith to be healed, 14:10 Said with a loud @;, Stand
up@c on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.

14:11 And when the @ saw what Paul had done, they lifted up @
@;s, @ in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men.

14:12 And they @, Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, @
he was the chief @Ker.

14:13 Then the @6 of Jupiter, @ was @	 @ city, @
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and @L have done sacrifice with
the @.

14:14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, @) of, they rent
@ clothes, and ran in @ the @, crying out, 14:15 And
@, Sirs, why do ye @ @? We also are men of like passions
with you, and preach unto you that ye @# turn from @ vanities
unto the living God, @ made @1, and @, and the sea, and
all @ that are @in: 14:16 Who in times past suffered all
nations to walk in @ own ways.

14:17 Nevertheless he left not @9 @S witness, in that he did
good, and gave us rain from @1, and fruitful seasons, filling our
@s with food and gladness.

14:18 And with @ @s scarce restrained they the @, that
they had not done sacrifice unto them.

14:19 And @ came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who persuaded the @, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the
city, supposing he had been dead.

14:20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round @+ him, he rose up, and
came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe.

14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned @* to Lystra, and to Iconium, and
Antioch, 14:22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting
them to continue in the faith, and that we must @E much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

14:23 And when they had ordained them elders in @ church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
believed.

14:24 And @ they had passed @Eout Pisidia, they came to
Pamphylia.

14:25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
into Attalia: 14:26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had
been recommended to the grace of God for the work @ they
fulfilled.

14:27 And when they were come, and had ga@d the church @?,
they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

14:28 And @ they abode long time with the disciples.

15:1 And certain men @ came down from Judaea taught the @3,
and said, Except ye be circumcised @ the manner of @, ye
cannot be saved.

15:2 When @fore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain @C of them, @# go up to @  unto the apostles and
elders @+ this question.

15:3 And being @ on @ way by the church, they passed @E
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and
they caused @ joy unto all the @3.

15:4 And when they were come to @ , they were received of the
church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all @
that God had done with them.

15:5 But @ rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees @
believed, @, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to
command them to keep the law of @.

15:6 And the apostles and elders came @? for to consider of this
matter.

15:7 And when @ had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
unto them, Men and @3, ye know how that a good while ago God
made choice @ us, that the Gentiles by my @P @# hear the
word of the gospel, and believe.

15:8 And God, @ knoweth the @s, bare them witness, giving them
the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 15:9 And put no difference
between us and them, purifying @ @s by faith.

15:10 Now @fore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
the disciples, @ @" our @s nor we were able to bear?
15:11 But we believe that @E the grace of the LORD @ @2
we @ be saved, even as they.

15:12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought
@ the Gentiles by them.

15:13 And @ they had held @ @U, James @>, @, Men
and @3, hearken unto me: 15:14 Simeon hath declared how God at
the @O did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a @ for his
name.

15:15 And to this agree the @5 of the prophets; as it is written,
15:16 After this I will return, and will build @* the tabernacle of
@, @ is fallen down; and I will build @* the ruins @of,
and I will set it up: 15:17 That the residue of men @B seek @
the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is @,, @
 the
Lord, who doeth all @ @.

15:18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
world.

15:19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, @ from
@ the Gentiles are turned to God: 15:20 But that we write unto
them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from
fornication, and from @ strangled, and from @I.

15:21 For @ of old time hath in @ city them that preach him,
being read in the synagogues @ sabbath day.

15:22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
to send chosen men of @ own company to Antioch with Paul and
Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men @
the @3: 15:23 And they wrote letters by them @ this manner;
The apostles and elders and @3 send greeting unto the @3
@ are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

15:24 Forasmuch as we have @), that certain @ went out from us
have troubled you with @5, subverting your souls, @, Ye must
be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
15:25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 15:26 Men that
have hazarded @ lives for the name of our Lord @ @2.

15:27 We have sent @fore Judas and Silas, who @ also tell you
the same @ by @P.

15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
no @er burden than @ necessary @; 15:29 That ye abstain
from meats offered to idols, and from @I, and from @
strangled, and from fornication: from @ if ye keep yourselves, ye
@ do well. Fare ye well.

15:30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they
had ga@d the multitude @?, they delivered the epistle: 15:31
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

15:32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also @T, exhorted
the @3 with many @5, and confirmed them.

15:33 And @ they had tarried @ a space, they were let go in
@U from the @3 unto the apostles.

15:34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide @ still.

15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
preaching the word of the Lord, with many @Cs also.

15:36 And some days @ Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go @* and
visit our @3 in @ city where we have preached the word of
the LORD, and see how they do.

15:37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
was Mark.

15:38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

15:39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
as@[ one from the @C: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto
Cyprus; 15:40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by
the @3 unto the grace of God.

15:41 And he went @E Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

16:1 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, @%, a certain disciple
was @, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, @ was a
Jewess, and believed; but his @ was a Greek: 16:2 Which was well
reported of by the @3 that were at Lystra and Iconium.

16:3 Him @L Paul have to go @ with him; and took and
circumcised him @ of the Jews @ were in @J quarters: for
they knew all that his @ was a Greek.

16:4 And as they went @E the @G, they delivered them the
decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders
@ were at @ .

16:5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
in number daily.

16:6 Now when they had gone @Eout Phrygia and the region of
Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
Asia, 16:7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

16:8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
Macedonia, and prayed him, @, Come over into Macedonia, and help
us.

16:10 And @ he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to
go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had @, us for
to preach the gospel unto them.

16:11 @N loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 16:12 And from thence to
Philippi, @ is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a
colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.

16:13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and @0 unto the
women @ resorted thither.

16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
of Thyatira, @ worshipped God, @) us: whose @ the Lord
opened, that she attended unto the @ @ were spoken of Paul.

16:15 And when she was baptized, and her @hold, she besought us,
@, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
@, and abide @. And she constrained us.

16:16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination met us, @ @ her
masters much gain by sooth@: 16:17 The same followed Paul and us,
and cried, @, These men are the @<s of the most high God,
@ shew unto us the way of salvation.

16:18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and
said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of @ @2 to come
out of her.

And he came out the same hour.

16:19 And when her masters saw that the hope of @ gains was gone,
they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the market@' unto
the rulers, 16:20 And @ them to the magistrates, @, These
men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 16:21 And teach
customs, @ are not lawful for us to receive, @" to observe,
being Romans.

16:22 And the multitude rose up @? @
 them: and the
magistrates rent off @ clothes, and @M to beat them.

16:23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 16:24 Who,
having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and
made @ feet fast in the stocks.

16:25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
God: and the prisoners @) them.

16:26 And suddenly @ was a @ @quake, so that the
@Vations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors
were opened, and @ one's bands were loosed.

16:27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his @Q, and @L have
killed @9, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

16:28 But Paul cried with a loud @;, @, Do thyself no harm:
for we are all here.

16:29 Then he @, for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
and fell down @	 Paul and Silas, 16:30 And @ them out, and
said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  16:31 And they said, Believe
on the Lord @ @2, and thou @ be saved, and thy @.

16:32 And they @0 unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
were in his @.

16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed @
stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

16:34 And when he had @ them into his @, he set meat @	
them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his @.

16:35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, @,
Let @J men go.

16:36 And the keeper of the prison told this @ to Paul, The
magistrates have sent to let you go: now @fore depart, and go in
@U.

16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily; but let them come @T and fetch us
out.

16:38 And the serjeants told @ @5 unto the magistrates: and
they feared, when they @) that they were Romans.

16:39 And they came and besought them, and @ them out, and
desired them to depart out of the city.

16:40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the @ of
Lydia: and when they had seen the @3, they comforted them, and
departed.

17:1 Now when they had passed @E Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 17:2 And
Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and @@ sabbath days
reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 17:3 Opening and alleging,
that @2 must needs have suffered, and risen @* from the dead;
and that this @, whom I preach unto you, is @2.

17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
of the devout Greeks a @ multitude, and of the chief women not a
few.

17:5 But the Jews @ believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and ga@d a company, and
set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the @ of Jason, and
sought to @( them out to the @.

17:6 And when they @V them not, they drew Jason and certain
@3 unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned
the world upside down are come hither also; 17:7 Whom Jason hath
received: and @ all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, @
that @ is @F king, one @.

17:8 And they troubled the @ and the rulers of the city, when
they @) @ @.

17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the @C, they
let them go.

17:10 And the @3 immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.

17:11 These were more noble than @J in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether @J @ were so.

17:12 @N many of them believed; also of honourable women @
were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred
up the @.

17:14 And then immediately the @3 sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode @ still.

17:15 And they that conducted Paul @ him unto Athens: and
receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him
with all speed, they departed.

17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city wholly @= to idolatry.

17:17 @N disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.

17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? @C
some, He seemeth to be a setter @ of strange gods: @ he
preached unto them @, and the resurrection.

17:19 And they took him, and @ him unto Areopagus, @, May
we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou @Kest, is?  17:20 For
thou @(est certain strange @ to our ears: we @L know
@fore what @ @ mean.

17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers @ were @ spent
@ time in no@7 else, but either to tell, or to hear some new
@7.)  17:22 Then Paul stood in the @a of Mars' hill, and said,
Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all @ ye are too
superstitious.

17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I @V an @\
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom @fore ye
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

17:24 God that made the world and all @ @in, seeing that he
is Lord of @1 and @, dwelleth not in temples made with @D;
17:25 Neither is worshipped with men's @D, as though he needed any
@7, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all @; 17:26
And hath made of one @I all nations of men for to dwell on all the
face of the @, and hath determined the times @	 appointed, and
the bounds of @ habitation; 17:27 That they @# seek the Lord,
if haply they @B feel @ him, and find him, though he be not far
from @ one of us: 17:28 For in him we live, and move, and have our
being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also
his offspring.

17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man's device.

17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men @ where to repent: 17:31 Because he hath
appointed a day, in the @ he will judge the world in @ceousness
by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath @= assurance
unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

17:32 And when they @) of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: and @Cs said, We will hear thee @* of this matter.

17:33 So Paul departed from @ them.

17:34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: @ the
@ was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and
@Cs with them.

18:1 After @ @ Paul departed from Athens, and came to
Corinth; 18:2 And @V a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus,
lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (@ that
Claudius had @M all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto
them.

18:3 And @ he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
wrought: for by @ occupation they were tentmakers.

18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue @ sabbath, and persuaded the
Jews and the Greeks.

18:5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that @ was
@2.

18:6 And when they opposed @T, and blasphemed, he shook his
raiment, and said unto them, Your @I be upon your own heads; I am
clean; from hence@ I will go unto the Gentiles.

18:7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's @,
named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose @ joined hard to the
synagogue.

18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
Lord with all his @; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed,
and were baptized.

18:9 Then @0 the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
afraid, but @K, and hold not thy @U: 18:10 For I am with thee,
and no man @ set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much @ in
this city.

18:11 And he continued @ a year and six months, teaching the word
of God @ them.

18:12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
insurrection with one accord @
 Paul, and @ him to the
judgment seat, 18:13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God
contrary to the law.

18:14 And when Paul was now @+ to open his @P, Gallio said unto
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,
reason @L that I @# bear with you: 18:15 But if it be a
question of @5 and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I
will be no judge of such matters.

18:16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
synagogue, and beat him @	 the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for
none of @J @.

18:18 And Paul @ this tarried @ yet a good while, and then
took his leave of the @3, and sailed thence into Syria, and with
him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he
had a vow.

18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them @: but he @9
entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
consented not; 18:21 But bade them farewell, @, I must by all
means keep this feast that cometh in @ : but I will return
@* unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
church, he went down to Antioch.

18:23 And @ he had spent some time @, he departed, and went
over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening
all the disciples.

18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
man, and @By in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
fervent in the spirit, he @0 and taught diligently the @ of
the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

18:26 And he began to @K boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had @), they took him unto them, and expounded unto
him the way of God more perfectly.

18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the @3
wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come,
helped them much @ had believed @E grace: 18:28 For he
@Bily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the
scriptures that @ was @2.

19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed @E the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding
certain disciples, 19:2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy
Ghost since ye believed?  And they said unto him, We have not so much
as @) whether @ be any Holy Ghost.

19:3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
said, Unto John's baptism.

19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
repentance, @ unto the @, that they @# believe on him
@ @# come @ him, that is, on @2 @.

19:5 When they @) this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
@.

19:6 And when Paul had laid his @D upon them, the Holy Ghost came
on them; and they @0 with tongues, and prophesied.

19:7 And all the men were @+ twelve.

19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and @0 boldly for the space of
@@ months, disputing and persuading the @ concerning the
kingdom of God.

19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but @0 evil
of that way @	 the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

19:10 And this continued by the space of two @8; so that all they
@ dwelt in Asia @) the word of the Lord @, both Jews and
Greeks.

19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the @D of Paul: 19:12 So
that from his body were @ unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons,
and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of
them.

19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
call over them @ had evil spirits the name of the LORD @,
@, We adjure you by @ whom Paul preacheth.

19:14 And @ were @H sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
@6s, @ did so.

19:15 And the evil spirit @> and said, @ I know, and Paul I
know; but who are ye?  19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was
leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed @
 them, so that
they fled out of that @ naked and wounded.

19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord @ was
magnified.

19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed @
deeds.

19:19 Many of them also @ used curious arts @ @ books
@?, and burned them @	 all men: and they counted the price
of them, and @V it fifty @: pieces of silver.

19:20 So @Bily grew the word of God and prevailed.

19:21 After @ @ were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when
he had passed @E Macedonia and Achaia, to go to @ ,
@, After I have been @, I must also see Rome.

19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
Timotheus and Erastus; but he @9 stayed in Asia for a season.

19:23 And the same time @ arose no small stir @+ that way.

19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, @ made
silver shrines for Diana, @ no small gain unto the craftsmen;
19:25 Whom he @, @? with the workmen of like occupation, and
said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
@Eout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much
@, @ that they be no gods, @ are made with @D: 19:27
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but
also that the temple of the @ goddess Diana @# be despised,
and her magnificence @# be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth.

19:28 And when they @) @ @s, they were full of wrath, and
cried out, @, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel,
they rushed with one accord into the theatre.

19:30 And when Paul @L have entered in unto the @, the
disciples suffered him not.

19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, @ were his friends, sent
unto him, desiring him that he @L not adventure @9 into the
theatre.

19:32 Some @fore cried one @7, and some @F: for the
assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were
come @?.

19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and @L have made
his defence unto the @.

19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one @; @+
the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the @, he said, Ye men
of Ephesus, what man is @ that knoweth not how that the city of
the Ephesians is a worshipper of the @ goddess Diana, and of the
image @ fell down from Jupiter?  19:36 Seeing then that @
@ cannot be spoken @
, ye ought to be quiet, and to do
no@7 rashly.

19:37 For ye have @ hither @ men, @ are @" robbers

19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen @ are with him,
have a matter @
 any man, the law is open, and @ are

19:39 But if ye enquire any @7 concerning @C matters, it @
be determined in a lawful assembly.

19:40 For we are in danger to be @, in question for this day's
uproar, @ being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
concourse.

19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

20:1 And @ the uproar was ceased, Paul @, unto him the
disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.

20:2 And when he had gone over @J parts, and had @= them much
exhortation, he came into Greece, 20:3 And @ abode @@ months.
And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was @+ to sail into
Syria, he purposed to return @E Macedonia.

20:4 And @ accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and
Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

20:5 These going @	 tarried for us at Troas.

20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi @ the days of unleavened
@d, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode @H
days.

20:7 And upon the @O day of the week, when the disciples came
@? to break @d, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on
the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

20:8 And @ were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
ga@d @?.

20:9 And @ sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he
sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken
up dead.

20:10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

20:11 When he @fore was come up @*, and had broken @d, and
eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
departed.

20:12 And they @ the young man alive, and were not a little
comforted.

20:13 And we went @	 to ship, and sailed unto Assos, @
intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding @9 to
go afoot.

20:14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
Mitylene.

20:15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over @
 Chios;
and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and
the next day we came to Miletus.

20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, @ he @L not
spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to
be at @  the day of Pentecost.

20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and @, the elders of
the church.

20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from
the @O day that I came into Asia, @ what manner I have been
with you at all seasons, 20:19 Serving the LORD with all humility of
mind, and with many tears, and temptations, @ befell me by the
lying in wait of the Jews: 20:20 And how I kept back no@7 that was

20:22 And now, @%, I go bound in the spirit unto @ , not

20:25 And now, @%, I know that ye all, @ whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God, @ see my face no more.

20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the

20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of

20:28 Take heed @fore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over

of God, @ he hath purchased with his own @I.

20:29 For I know this, that @ my departing @ grievous wolves

20:30 Also of your own selves @ men arise, @King perverse
@, to draw away disciples @ them.

20:31 @N watch, and remember, that by the space of @@ @8
I ceased not to warn @ one night and day with tears.

20:32 And now, @3, I commend you to God, and to the word of his

@ all them @ are sanctified.

20:33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that @ @D have ministered unto

20:35 I have shewed you all @, how that so labouring ye ought to

said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
them all.

20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the @5 @ he @0, that they
@# see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

21:1 And it came to pass, that @ we were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 21:2 And finding a
ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set @.

21:3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for @ the ship was to
unlade her burden.

21:4 And finding disciples, we tarried @ @H days: who said to
Paul @E the Spirit, that he @# not go up to @ .

21:5 And when we had accomplished @J days, we departed and went our
way; and they all @ us on our way, with wives and @, till
we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.

21:6 And when we had taken our leave one of @F, we took ship; and
they returned home @*.

21:7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
Ptolemais, and saluted the @3, and abode with them one day.

21:8 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the @ of Philip the
evangelist, @ was one of the @H; and abode with him.

21:9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, @ did prophesy.

21:10 And as we tarried @ many days, @ came down from Judaea a
certain prophet, named Agabus.

21:11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
his own @D and feet, and said, Thus @
 the Holy Ghost, So @
the Jews at @  bind the man that owneth this girdle, and @
deliver him into the @D of the Gentiles.

21:12 And when we @) @ @, both we, and they of that @',
besought him not to go up to @ .

21:13 Then Paul @>, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
@?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
@  for the name of the Lord @.

21:14 And when he @L not be persuaded, we ceased, @, The will
of the Lord be done.

21:15 And @ @J days we took up our carriages, and went up to
@ .

21:16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
and @ with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom
we @# lodge.

21:17 And when we were come to @ , the @3 received us
gladly.

21:18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
the elders were present.

21:19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
@ God had wrought @ the Gentiles by his ministry.

21:20 And when they @) it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
him, Thou seest, @X, how many @:s of Jews @ are @
believe; and they are all zealous of the law: 21:21 And they are
informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews @ are @ the
Gentiles to forsake @, @ that they ought not to circumcise
@ @, @" to walk @ the customs.

21:22 What is it @fore? the multitude must needs come @?:
for they will hear that thou art come.

21:23 Do @fore this that we say to thee: We have four men @
have a vow on them; 21:24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and
be at charges with them, that they may shave @ heads: and all may
know that @J @, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
are no@7; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest
the law.

21:25 As touching the Gentiles @ believe, we have written and
concluded that they observe no such @7, save only that they keep
@T from @ offered to idols, and from @I, and from
strangled, and from fornication.

21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying @9 with
them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the
days of purification, until that an @& @# be offered for
@ one of them.

21:27 And when the @H days were almost ended, the Jews @ were
of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the @,
and laid @D on him, 21:28 Crying out, Men of @, help: This is
the man, that teacheth all men @ where @
 the @, and the
law, and this @': and further @ Greeks also into the temple,
and hath polluted this holy @'.

21:29 (For they had seen @	 with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had @ into the temple.)
21:30 And all the city was moved, and the @ ran @?: and
they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and @with the
doors were shut.

21:31 And as they went @+ to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all @  was in an uproar.

21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left
beating of Paul.

21:33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and @M
him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he
had done.

21:34 And some cried one @7, some @F, @ the multitude: and
when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he @M him
to be carried into the castle.

21:35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the @.

21:36 For the multitude of the @ followed @, crying, Away
with him.

21:37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I @K unto thee? Who said, Canst thou @K
Greek?  21:38 Art not thou that @-ian, @ @	 @ days
madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four @:
men that were murderers?  21:39 But Paul said, I am a man @ am a
Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I
beseech thee, suffer me to @K unto the @.

21:40 And when he had @= him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
beckoned with the hand unto the @. And when @ was made a
@ silence, he @0 unto them in the Hebrew tongue, @, 22:1
Men, @3, and @s, hear ye my defence @ I make now unto
you.

22:2 (And when they @) that he @0 in the Hebrew tongue to them,
they kept the more silence: and he @
,) 22:3 I am verily a man
@ am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet @ up in
this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught @$ to the perfect
manner of the law of the @s, and was zealous toward God, as ye
all are this day.

22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the @^, binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women.

22:5 As also the high @6 doth bear me witness, and all the estate
of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the @3,
and went to Damascus, to @( them @ were @ bound unto
@ , for to be punished.

22:6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
nigh unto Damascus @+ noon, suddenly @ shone from @1 a
@ light round @+ me.

22:7 And I fell unto the ground, and @) a @; @ unto me,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  22:8 And I @>, Who art
thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am @ of Nazareth, whom thou
persecutest.

22:9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
but they @) not the @; of him that @0 to me.

22:10 And I said, What @ I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
Arise, and go into Damascus; and @ it @ be told thee of all
@ @ are appointed for thee to do.

22:11 And when I could not see for the @Y of that light, being led
by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.

22:12 And one Ananias, a devout man @$ to the law, having a
good report of all the Jews @ dwelt @, 22:13 Came unto me, and
stood, and said unto me, Br@C Saul, receive thy sight. And the same
hour I looked up upon him.

22:14 And he said, The God of our @s hath chosen thee, that thou
@#est know his will, and see that Just One, and @#est hear the
@; of his @P.

22:15 For thou @ be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
seen and @).

22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

22:17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come @* to @ ,
even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 22:18 And saw
him @ unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of @ :
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in @
synagogue them that believed on thee: 22:20 And when the @I of thy
martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto
his @^, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.

22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto
the Gentiles.

22:22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
@ @;s, and said, Away with such a fellow from the @: for it
is not fit that he @# live.

22:23 And as they cried out, and cast off @ clothes, and threw
dust into the air, 22:24 The chief captain @M him to be @
into the castle, and bade that he @# be examined by scourging;
that he @B know wherefore they cried so @
 him.

22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,
and uncondemned?  22:26 When the centurion @) that, he went and
told the chief captain, @, Take heed what thou doest: for this
man is a Roman.

22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

22:28 And the chief captain @>, With a @ sum obtained I this
freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

22:29 Then straightway they departed from him @ @# have
examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, @ he knew
that he was a Roman, and @ he had bound him.

22:30 On the morrow, @ he @L have known the certainty
wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands,
and @M the chief @6s and all @ council to appear, and
@ Paul down, and set him @	 them.

23:1 And Paul, earnestly @%ing the council, said, Men and
@3, I have lived in all good conscience @	 God until this
day.

23:2 And the high @6 Ananias @M them that stood by him to
smite him on the @P.

23:3 Then said Paul unto him, God @ smite thee, thou whited wall:
for sittest thou to judge me @ the law, and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law?  23:4 And they that stood by said,
Revilest thou God's high @6?  23:5 Then said Paul, I wist not,
@3, that he was the high @6: for it is written, Thou @
not @K evil of the ruler of thy @.

23:6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
@C Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and @3, I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the
dead I am @, in question.

23:7 And when he had so said, @ arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

23:8 For the Sadducees say that @ is no resurrection, @"
angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

23:9 And @ arose a @ cry: and the scribes that were of the
Pharisees' part arose, and strove, @, We find no evil in this
man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight
@
 God.

23:10 And when @ arose a @ dissension, the chief captain,
fearing lest Paul @# have been pulled in pieces of them, @M
the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from @ them, and
to @( him into the castle.

23:11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in @ , so
must thou bear witness also at Rome.

23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded @?, and
bound @T @[ a curse, @ that they @L @" eat nor
@b till they had killed Paul.

23:13 And they were more than forty @ had made this conspiracy.

23:14 And they came to the chief @6s and elders, and said, We have
bound ourselves @[ a @ curse, that we will eat no@7 until we
have slain Paul.

23:15 Now @fore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
that he @( him down unto you to morrow, as though ye @L enquire
some@7 more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near,
are ready to kill him.

23:16 And when Paul's sister's son @) of @ lying in wait, he
went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

23:17 Then Paul @, one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain @7 to
tell him.

23:18 So he took him, and @ him to the chief captain, and said,
Paul the prisoner @, me unto him, and prayed me to @( this
young man unto thee, who hath some@7 to say unto thee.

23:19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
@Lest @( down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they
@L enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

23:21 But do not thou yield unto them: for @ lie in wait for him
of them more than forty men, @ have bound @T with an oath,
that they will @" eat nor @b till they have killed him: and
now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.

23:22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged
him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed @ @ to me.

23:23 And he @, unto him two centurions, @, Make ready two
@/ soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen @@score and ten,
and spearmen two @/, at the third hour of the night; 23:24 And
provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and @( him safe
unto Felix the governor.

23:25 And he wrote a letter @ this manner: 23:26 Claudius Lysias
unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.

23:27 This man was taken of the Jews, and @# have been killed of
them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having @[stood
that he was a Roman.

23:28 And when I @L have known the cause wherefore they accused
him, I @ him @ into @ council: 23:29 Whom I perceived to
be accused of questions of @ law, but to have no@7 laid to his
charge worthy of @^ or of bonds.

23:30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also
to say @	 thee what they had @
 him. Farewell.

23:31 Then the soldiers, as it was @M them, took Paul, and
@ him by night to Antipatris.

23:32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
returned to the castle: 23:33 Who, when they came to Caesarea and
delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also @	 him.

23:34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
province he was. And when he @[stood that he was of Cilicia; 23:35
I will hear thee, said he, when @ accusers are also come. And he
@M him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

24:1 And @ five days Ananias the high @6 descended with the
elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the
governor @
 Paul.

24:2 And when he was @, @, Tertullus began to accuse him,
@, Seeing that by thee we enjoy @ quietness, and that very
worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 24:3 We
accept it always, and in all @'s, most noble Felix, with all
thankfulness.

24:4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
thee that thou @Lest hear us of thy clemency a few @5.

24:5 For we have @V this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
sedition @ all the Jews @Eout the world, and a ringleader of
the sect of the Nazarenes: 24:6 Who also hath gone @+ to profane
the temple: whom we took, and @L have judged @$ to our law.

24:7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with @
violence took him away out of our @D, 24:8 Commanding his accusers
to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge
of all @ @, whereof we accuse him.

24:9 And the Jews also assented, @ that @ @ were so.

24:10 Then Paul, @ that the governor had beckoned unto him to
@K, @>, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many @8
a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
24:11 Because that thou mayest @[stand, that @ are yet but
twelve days since I went up to @  for to worship.

24:12 And they @" @V me in the temple disputing with any man,
@" raising up the @, @" in the synagogues, nor in the
city: 24:13 Neither can they prove the @ whereof they now accuse
me.

24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that @ the way @ they call
heresy, so worship I the God of my @s, believing all @ @
are written in the law and in the prophets: 24:15 And have hope toward
God, @ they @T also allow, that @ @ be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
void to offence toward God, and toward men.

24:17 Now @ many @8 I came to @( alms to my nation, and
@&s.

24:18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia @V me purified in the
temple, @" with multitude, nor with tumult.

24:19 Who ought to have been here @	 thee, and object, if they had
ought @
 me.

24:20 Or else let @ same here say, if they have @V any evil
doing in me, while I stood @	 the council, 24:21 Except it be for
this one @;, that I cried standing @ them, Touching the
resurrection of the dead I am @, in question by you this day.

24:22 And when Felix @) @ @, having more perfect knowledge
of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain
@ come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

24:23 And he @M a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
liberty, and that he @# forbid none of his acquaintance to
minister or come unto him.

24:24 And @ certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
@ was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and @) him concerning the
faith in @2.

24:25 And as he reasoned of @ceousness, temperance, and judgment to
come, Felix trembled, and @>, Go thy way for this time; when I
have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

24:26 He hoped also that money @# have been @= him of Paul,
that he @B loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and
communed with him.

24:27 But @ two @8 Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, @ @@ days he
ascended from Caesarea to @ .

25:2 Then the high @6 and the chief of the Jews informed him
@
 Paul, and besought him, 25:3 And desired favour @
 him,
that he @L send for him to @ , laying wait in the way to
kill him.

25:4 But Festus @>, that Paul @# be kept at Caesarea, and
that he @9 @L depart shortly thither.

25:5 Let them @fore, said he, @ @ you are able, go down
with me, and accuse this man, if @ be any wickedness in him.

25:6 And when he had tarried @ them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
@M Paul to be @.

25:7 And when he was come, the Jews @ came down from @ 
stood round @+, and laid many and grievous complaints @
 Paul,
@ they could not prove.

25:8 While he @> for @9, Neither @
 the law of the
Jews, @" @
 the temple, nor yet @
 Caesar, have I
offended any @7 at all.

25:9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, @> Paul, and
said, Wilt thou go up to @ , and @ be judged of @
@ @	 me?  25:10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment
seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as
thou very well knowest.

25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any @7 worthy of
@^, I refuse not to die: but if @ be none of @ @
whereof @ accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal
unto Caesar.

25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, @>,
Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar @ thou go.

25:13 And @ certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Caesarea to salute Festus.

25:14 And when they had been @ many days, Festus declared Paul's
cause unto the king, @, There is a certain man left in bonds by
Felix: 25:15 About whom, when I was at @ , the chief @6s
and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
@
 him.

25:16 To whom I @>, It is not the manner of the Romans to
deliver any man to die, @	 that he @ is accused have the
accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for @9
concerning the crime laid @
 him.

25:17 @N, when they were come hither, @S any delay on the
morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and @M the man to be @
@.

25:18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they @ none
accusation of such @ as I supposed: 25:19 But had certain
questions @
 him of @ own superstition, and of one @,
@ was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

25:20 And @ I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
whether he @L go to @ , and @ be judged of @
matters.

25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
Augustus, I @M him to be kept till I @B send him to Caesar.

25:22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I @L also hear the man myself.
To morrow, said he, thou @ hear him.

25:23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
@ pomp, and was entered into the @' of hearing, with the chief
captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul
was @ @.

25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men @ are here
present with us, ye see this man, @+ whom all the multitude of the
Jews have dealt with me, both at @ , and also here, crying that
he ought not to live any longer.

25:25 But when I @V that he had committed no@7 worthy of @^,
and that he @9 hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to
send him.

25:26 Of whom I have no certain @7 to write unto my lord. Wherefore
I have @ him @ @	 you, and specially @	 thee, O king
Agrippa, that, @ examination had, I @B have somewhat to write.

25:27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
withal to signify the crimes laid @
 him.

26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to @K for
thyself.

Then Paul stretched @ the hand, and @> for @9: 26:2 I
think myself happy, king Agrippa, @ I @ answer for myself
this day @	 thee touching all the @ whereof I am accused of
the Jews: 26:3 Especially @ I know thee to be expert in all
customs and questions @ are @ the Jews: wherefore I beseech
thee to hear me patiently.

26:4 My manner of life from my youth, @ was at the @O @
mine own nation at @ , know all the Jews; 26:5 Which knew me
from the beginning, if they @L testify, that @ the most
straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
God, unto our @s: 26:7 Unto @ promise our twelve tribes,
instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For @ hope's
sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

26:8 Why @# it be thought a @7 incredible with you, that God
@# raise the dead?  26:9 I verily thought with myself, that I
ought to do many @ contrary to the name of @ of Nazareth.

26:10 Which @7 I also did in @ : and many of the saints did
I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief @6s;
and when they were put to @^, I gave my @; @
 them.

26:11 And I punished them oft in @ synagogue, and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad @
 them, I persecuted
them even unto strange @G.

26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief @6s, 26:13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a
light from @1, above the b@cness of the sun, shining round
@+ me and them @ journeyed with me.

26:14 And when we were all fallen to the @, I @) a @;
@King unto me, and @ in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick @
 the pricks.

26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am @ whom
thou persecutest.

26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee
for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of @
@ @ thou hast seen, and of @J @ in the @ I will
appear unto thee; 26:17 Delivering thee from the @, and from the
Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 26:18 To open @ eyes, and to
turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive for@=ess of sins, and inheritance @
them @ are sanctified by faith that is in me.

26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
@1ly vision: 26:20 But shewed @O unto them of Damascus, and at
@ , and @Eout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the
Gentiles, that they @# repent and turn to God, and do works meet
for repentance.

26:21 For @ causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
@+ to kill me.

26:22 Having @fore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and @, @ none @C @ than
@J @ the prophets and @ did say @# come: 26:23 That
@2 @# suffer, and that he @# be the @O that @# rise
from the dead, and @# shew light unto the @, and to the
Gentiles.

26:24 And as he thus @0 for @9, Festus said with a loud @;,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but @K @
the @5 of truth and soberness.

26:26 For the king knoweth of @ @, @	 whom also I @K
freely: for I am persuaded that none of @ @ are hidden from
him; for this @7 was not done in a corner.

26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.

26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
@2ian.

26:29 And Paul said, I @L to God, that not only thou, but also all
that hear me this day, were both almost, and al@? such as I am,
except @ bonds.

26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 26:31 And when they were
gone aside, they talked between @T, @, This man doeth
no@7 worthy of @^ or of bonds.

26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man @B have been set at
liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

27:1 And when it was determined that we @# sail into Italy, they
delivered Paul and certain @C prisoners unto one named Julius, a
centurion of Augustus' band.

27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to
sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of
Thessalonica, being with us.

27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh
@9.

27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed @[ Cyprus,
@ the winds were contrary.

27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

27:6 And @ the centurion @V a ship of Alexandria sailing into
Italy; and he put us @in.

27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
over @
 Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed @[ Crete,
over @
 Salmone; 27:8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a @'
@ is @, The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
@ the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, 27:10 And
said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt
and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our
lives.

27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
the ship, more than @J @ @ were spoken by Paul.

27:12 And @ the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they @B attain
to Phenice, and @ to winter; @ is an haven of Crete, and lieth
toward the south west and north west.

27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
obtained @ purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.

27:14 But not long @ @ arose @
 it a tempestuous wind,
@, Euroclydon.

27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
wind, we let her drive.

27:16 And running @[ a certain island @ is @, Clauda, we
had much work to come by the boat: 27:17 Which when they had taken up,
they used helps, @[girding the ship; and, fearing lest they @#
fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

27:18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
they lightened the ship; 27:19 And the third day we cast out with our
own @D the tackling of the ship.

27:20 And when @" sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
small tempest lay on us, all hope that we @# be saved was then
taken away.

27:21 But @ long abstinence Paul stood @ in the @a of them,
and said, Sirs, ye @# have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed
from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.

27:22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for @ @ be no
loss of any man's life @ you, but of the ship.

27:23 For @ stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
and whom I serve, 27:24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be @
@	 Caesar: and, lo, God hath @= thee all them that sail with
thee.

27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
@ be even as it was told me.

27:26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

27:27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
down in Adria, @+ midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near
to some country; 27:28 And sounded, and @V it twenty fathoms: and
when they had gone a little further, they sounded @*, and @V it
fifteen fathoms.

27:29 Then fearing lest we @# have fallen upon rocks, they cast
four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

27:30 And as the shipmen were @+ to flee out of the ship, when they
had let down the boat into the sea, @[ colour as though they @L
have cast anchors out of the foreship, 27:31 Paul said to the
centurion and to the soldiers, Except @ abide in the ship, ye
cannot be saved.

27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
fall off.

27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
meat, @, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
continued fasting, having taken no@7.

27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
health: for @ @ not an hair fall from the head of any of you.

27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took @d, and gave thanks to
God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to
eat.

27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.

27:37 And we were in all in the ship two @/ @@score and
sixteen souls.

27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
cast out the wheat into the sea.

27:39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
a certain creek with a shore, into the @ they were minded, if it
were possible, to thrust in the ship.

27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
@T unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up
the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

27:41 And falling into a @' where two seas met, they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the
hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

27:42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of
them @# swim out, and escape.

27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from @
purpose; and @M that they @ could swim @# cast
@T @O into the sea, and get to land: 27:44 And the rest,
some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.

And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
@, Melita.

28:2 And the barbarous @ shewed us no little kindness: for they
kindled a fire, and received us @ one, @ of the present
rain, and @ of the cold.

28:3 And when Paul had ga@d a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
the fire, @ came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his
hand.

28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
they said @ @T, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

28:6 Howbeit they looked when he @# have swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly: but @ they had looked a @ while, and saw no
harm come to him, they changed @ minds, and said that he was a
god.

28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us @@
days courteously.

28:8 And it came to pass, that the @ of Publius lay sick of a
fever and of a @Iy flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and
laid his @D on him, and healed him.

28:9 So when this was done, @Cs also, @ had diseases in the
island, came, and were healed: 28:10 Who also honoured us with many
honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such @ as were
necessary.

28:11 And @ @@ months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
@ had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried @ @@ days.

28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
@ one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
Puteoli: 28:14 Where we @V @3, and were desired to tarry with
them @H days: and so we went toward Rome.

28:15 And from thence, when the @3 @) of us, they came to
meet us as far as Appii forum, and The @@ taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by @9
with a soldier that kept him.

28:17 And it came to pass, that @ @@ days Paul @, the chief
of the Jews @?: and when they were come @?, he said unto
them, Men and @3, though I have committed no@7 @

@  into the @D of the Romans.

28:18 Who, when they had examined me, @L have let me go, @
@ was no cause of @^ in me.

28:19 But when the Jews @0 @
 it, I was constrained to appeal
unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

28:20 For this cause @fore have I @, for you, to see you, and
to @K with you: @ that for the hope of @ I am bound with

28:21 And they said unto him, We @" received letters out of
Judaea concerning thee, @" any of the @3 that came shewed
or @0 any harm of thee.

28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
concerning this sect, we know that @ where it is spoken @

28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, @ came many to him

28:24 And some believed the @ @ were spoken, and some
believed not.

28:25 And when they agreed not @ @T, they departed, @
that Paul had spoken one word, Well @0 the Holy Ghost by Esaias the

28:28 Be it known @fore unto you, that the salvation of God is

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans


1:1 Paul, a @< of @ @2, @, to be an apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God, 1:2 (Which he had promised afore by
his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 1:3 Concerning his Son @
@2 our Lord, @ was made of the seed of @ @$ to the
@R; 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, @$ to
the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 1:5 By whom
we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith
@ all nations, for his name: 1:6 Among whom are ye also the @,
of @ @2: 1:7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, @, to
be saints: Grace to you and @U from God our Father, and the Lord
@ @2.

1:8 First, I thank my God @E @ @2 for you all, that your
faith is spoken of @Eout the whole world.

1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his Son, that @S ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers; 1:10 Making request, if by any means now at length I @B
have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
gift, to the end ye may be established; 1:12 That is, that I may be
comforted @? with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

1:13 Now I @L not have you ignorant, @3, that oftentimes I
purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I @B have
some fruit @ you also, even as @ @C Gentiles.

1:14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
the wise, and to the unwise.

1:15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also.

1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of @2: for it is the power
of God unto salvation to @ one that believeth; to the Jew @O,
and also to the Greek.

1:17 For @in is the @ceousness of God revealed from faith to
faith: as it is written, The just @ live by faith.

1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from @1 @
 all
ungodliness and un@ceousness of men, who hold the truth in
un@ceousness; 1:19 Because that @ may be known of God is
manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

1:20 For the invisible @ of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being @[stood by the @ that are made, even
his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are @S excuse: 1:21
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
@" were thankful; but became vain in @ imaginations, and
@ foolish @ was darkened.

1:22 Professing @T to be wise, they became fools, 1:23 And
changed the @Y of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
@.

1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness @E the lusts
of @ own @s, to dishonour @ own bodies between @T:
1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.

1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
@ women did change the natural use into that @ is @

nature: 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
woman, burned in @ lust one toward @F; men with men working
that @ is unseemly, and receiving in @T that recompence of
@ error @ was meet.

1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in @ knowledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do @J @ @ are
not convenient; 1:29 Being filled with all un@ceousness,
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy,
murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 1:30 Backbiters, haters
of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil @,
disobedient to parents, 1:31 Without @[standing, covenantbreakers,
@S natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 1:32 Who knowing
the judgment of God, that they @ commit such @ are worthy of
@^, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

2:1 @N thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
judgest: for wherein thou judgest @F, thou condemnest thyself;
for thou that judgest doest the same @.

2:2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is @$ to truth
@
 them @ commit such @.

2:3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them @ do such
@, and doest the same, that thou @ escape the judgment of
God?  2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee
to repentance?  2:5 But @ thy hardness and impenitent @
treasurest up unto thyself wrath @
 the day of wrath and
revelation of the @ceous judgment of God; 2:6 Who will render to
@ man @$ to his deeds: 2:7 To them who by patient
continuance in well doing seek for @Y and honour and immortality,
eternal life: 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey
the truth, but obey un@ceousness, indignation and wrath, 2:9
Tribulation and anguish, upon @ soul of man that doeth evil, of
the Jew @O, and also of the Gentile; 2:10 But @Y, honour, and
@U, to @ man that worketh good, to the Jew @O, and also to
the Gentile: 2:11 For @ is no respect of persons with God.

2:12 For as many as have sinned @S law @ also perish @S
law: and as many as have sinned in the law @ be judged by the law;
2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just @	 God, but the
doers of the law @ be justified.

2:14 For when the Gentiles, @ have not the law, do by nature the
@ contained in the law, @, having not the law, are a law unto
@T: 2:15 Which shew the work of the law written in @
@s, @ conscience also bearing witness, and @ thoughts the
mean while accusing or else excusing one @F;) 2:16 In the day
when God @ judge the secrets of men by @ @2 @$ to
my gospel.

2:17 @., thou art @, a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
thy boast of God, 2:18 And knowest his will, and approvest the @
that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; 2:19 And art
confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them
@ are in darkness, 2:20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
babes, @ hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

2:21 Thou @fore @ teachest @F, teachest thou not thyself?
thou that preachest a man @# not steal, dost thou steal?  2:22
Thou that sayest a man @# not commit adultery, dost thou commit
adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?  2:23
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, @E breaking the law
dishonourest thou God?  2:24 For the name of God is blasphemed @
the Gentiles @E you, as it is written.

2:25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

2:26 @N if the uncircumcision keep the @ceousness of the
law, @ not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?  2:27
And @ not uncircumcision @ is by nature, if it fulfil the law,
judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the
law?  2:28 For he is not a Jew, @ is one outwardly; @" is
that circumcision, @ is outward in the @R: 2:29 But he is a
Jew, @ is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the @, in
the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
God.

3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is @ of
circumcision?  3:2 Much @ way: chiefly, @ that unto them
were committed the oracles of God.

3:3 For what if some did not believe? @ @ unbelief make the
faith of God @S effect?  3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true,
but @ man a liar; as it is written, That thou @Best be
justified in thy @s, and @Best overcome when thou art judged.

3:5 But if our un@ceousness commend the @ceousness of God, what
@ we say? Is God un@ceous who taketh vengeance? (I @K as a
man) 3:6 God forbid: for then how @ God judge the world?  3:7 For
if the truth of God hath more abounded @E my lie unto his @Y;
why yet am I also judged as a sinner?  3:8 And not rather, (as we be
slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do
evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
@	 proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all @[ sin;
3:10 As it is written, There is none @ceous, no, not one: 3:11
There is none that @[standeth, @ is none that seeketh @
God.

3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are @? become
unprofitable; @ is none that doeth good, no, not one.

3:13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with @ tongues they have
used deceit; the poison of asps is @[ @ lips: 3:14 Whose @P
is full of cursing and bitterness: 3:15 Their feet are swift to shed
@I: 3:16 Destruction and misery are in @ ways: 3:17 And the way
of @U have they not known: 3:18 There is no fear of God @	
@ eyes.

3:19 Now we know that what @ soever the law @
, it @
 to
them who are @[ the law: that @ @P may be stopped, and all
the world may become guilty @	 God.

3:20 @N by the deeds of the law @ @ no @R be
justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

3:21 But now the @ceousness of God @S the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 3:22 Even the
@ceousness of God @ is by faith of @ @2 unto all and
upon all them that believe: for @ is no difference: 3:23 For all
have sinned, and come short of the @Y of God; 3:24 Being justified
freely by his grace @E the redemption that is in @2 @:
3:25 Whom God hath set @ to be a propitiation @E faith in his
@I, to declare his @ceousness for the remission of sins that are
past, @E the forbearance of God; 3:26 To declare, I say, at this
time his @ceousness: that he @B be just, and the justifier of
him @ believeth in @.

3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
Nay: but by the law of faith.

3:28 @N we conclude that a man is justified by faith @S
the deeds of the law.

3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?
Yes, of the Gentiles also: 3:30 Seeing it is one God, @ @
justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision @E faith.

3:31 Do we then make void the law @E faith? God forbid: yea, we
establish the law.

4:1 What @ we say then that Abraham our @, as pertaining to
the @R, hath @V?  4:2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he
hath whereof to @Y; but not @	 God.

4:3 For what @
 the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
counted unto him for @ceousness.

4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but
of debt.

4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for @ceousness.

4:6 Even as @ also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
whom God imputeth @ceousness @S works, 4:7 Saying, Blessed are
they whose iniquities are for@=, and whose sins are covered.

4:8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

4:9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon
the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham
for @ceousness.

4:10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
@ceousness of the faith @ he had yet being uncircumcised: that
he @B be the @ of all them that believe, though they be not
circumcised; that @ceousness @B be imputed unto them also: 4:12
And the @ of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our @
Abraham, @ he had being yet uncircumcised.

4:13 For the promise, that he @# be the heir of the world, was not
to Abraham, or to his seed, @E the law, but @E the
@ceousness of faith.

4:14 For if they @ are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
and the promise made of none effect: 4:15 Because the law worketh
wrath: for where no law is, @ is no transgression.

4:16 @N it is of faith, that it @B be by grace; to the end
the promise @B be sure to all the seed; not to that only @ is
of the law, but to that also @ is of the faith of Abraham; who is
the @ of us all, 4:17 (As it is written, I have made thee a
@ of many nations,) @	 him whom he believed, even God, who
quickeneth the dead, and calleth @J @ @ be not as though
they were.

4:18 Who @
 hope believed in hope, that he @B become the
@ of many nations, @$ to that @ was spoken, So @
thy seed be.

4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
dead, when he was @+ an @/ @8 old, @" yet the deadness
of Sarah's womb: 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God @E
unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving @Y to God; 4:21 And being
fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to
perform.

4:22 And @fore it was imputed to him for @ceousness.

4:23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
him; 4:24 But for us also, to whom it @ be imputed, if we believe
on him that raised up @ our Lord from the dead; 4:25 Who was
delivered for our offences, and was raised @* for our
justification.

5:1 @N being justified by faith, we have @U with God @E
our Lord @ @2: 5:2 By whom also we have access by faith into
this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the @Y of God.

5:3 And not only so, but we @Y in tribulations also: knowing that
tribulation worketh patience; 5:4 And patience, experience; and
experience, hope: 5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed; @ the love of
God is shed abroad in our @s by the Holy Ghost @ is @= unto
us.

5:6 For when we were yet @S strength, in due time @2 died for
the ungodly.

5:7 For scarcely for a @ceous man will one die: yet peradventure
for a good man some @L even dare to die.

5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, @2 died for us.

5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his @I, we @ be
saved from wrath @E him.

5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
@^ of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we @ be saved by
his life.

5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God @E our Lord @
@2, by whom we have now received the atonement.

5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and @^ by
sin; and so @^ passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 5:13
(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when
@ is no law.

5:14 Nevertheless @^ reigned from Adam to @, even over them
that had not sinned @ the similitude of Adam's transgression, who
is the figure of him that was to come.

5:15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if @E
the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the
gift by grace, @ is by one man, @ @2, hath abounded unto
many.

5:16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
offences unto justification.

5:17 For if by one man's offence @^ reigned by one; much more they
@ receive abundance of grace and of the gift of @ceousness
@ reign in life by one, @ @2.)  5:18 @N as by the
offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
the @ceousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life.

5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of one @ many be made @ceous.

5:20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence @B abound. But
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 5:21 That as sin hath
reigned unto @^, even so @B grace reign @E @ceousness
unto eternal life by @ @2 our Lord.

6:1 What @ we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound?  6:2 God forbid. How @ we, that are dead to sin, live any
longer @in?  6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
into @ @2 were baptized into his @^?  6:4 @N we are
buried with him by baptism into @^: that like as @2 was raised
up from the dead by the @Y of the Father, even so we also @#
walk in newness of life.

6:5 For if we have been planted @? in the likeness of his @^,
we @ be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 6:6 Knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin
@B be destroyed, that hence@ we @# not serve sin.

6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

6:8 Now if we be dead with @2, we believe that we @ also live
with him: 6:9 Knowing that @2 being raised from the dead dieth no
more; @^ hath no more dominion over him.

6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
liveth, he liveth unto God.

6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
but alive unto God @E @ @2 our Lord.

6:12 Let not sin @fore reign in your mortal body, that ye @#
obey it in the lusts @of.

6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of un@ceousness
unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as @J that are alive from
the dead, and your members as instruments of @ceousness unto God.

6:14 For sin @ not have dominion over you: for ye are not @[
the law, but @[ grace.

6:15 What then? @ we sin, @ we are not @[ the law, but
@[ grace? God forbid.

6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves @<s to obey,
his @<s ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto @^, or of
obedience unto @ceousness?  6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were
the @<s of sin, but ye have obeyed from the @ that form of
doctrine @ was delivered you.

6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the @<s of
@ceousness.

6:19 I @K @ the manner of men @ of the infirmity of your
@R: for as ye have yielded your members @<s to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members @<s to
@ceousness unto holiness.

6:20 For when ye were the @<s of sin, ye were free from
@ceousness.

6:21 What fruit had ye then in @J @ whereof ye are now
ashamed?  for the end of @J @ is @^.

6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become @<s to God, ye
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

6:23 For the wages of sin is @^; but the gift of God is eternal
life @E @ @2 our Lord.

7:1 Know ye not, @3, (for I @K to them that know the law,)
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  7:2
For the woman @ hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from
the law of her husband.

7:3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to @F
man, she @ be @, an adulteress: but if her husband be dead,
she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be
married to @F man.

7:4 Wherefore, my @3, ye also are become dead to the law by the
body of @2; that ye @# be married to @F, even to him who
is raised from the dead, that we @# @( @ fruit unto God.

7:5 For when we were in the @R, the motions of sins, @ were by
the law, did work in our members to @( @ fruit unto @^.

7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
were held; that we @# serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
oldness of the letter.

7:7 What @ we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
had said, Thou @ not covet.

7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence. For @S the law sin was dead.

7:9 For I was alive @S the law once: but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.

7:10 And the commandment, @ was ordained to life, I @V to be
unto @^.

7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me.

7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good.

7:13 Was then that @ is good made @^ unto me? God forbid. But
sin, that it @B appear sin, working @^ in me by that @ is
good; that sin by the commandment @B become exceeding sinful.

7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
@[ sin.

7:15 For that @ I do I allow not: for what I @L, that do I not;
but what I hate, that do I.

7:16 If then I do that @ I @L not, I consent unto the law that
it is good.

7:17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my @R,) dwelleth no good
@7: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that @
is good I find not.

7:19 For the good that I @L I do not: but the evil @ I @L
not, that I do.

7:20 Now if I do that I @L not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
that dwelleth in me.

7:21 I find then a law, that, when I @L do good, evil is present
with me.

7:22 For I delight in the law of God @ the inward man: 7:23 But I
see @F law in my members, warring @
 the law of my mind, and
@(ing me into captivity to the law of sin @ is in my members.

7:24 O wretched man that I am! who @ deliver me from the body of
this @^?  7:25 I thank God @E @ @2 our Lord. So then
with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the @R the
law of sin.

8:1 There is @fore now no condemnation to them @ are in @2
@, who walk not @ the @R, but @ the Spirit.

8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in @2 @ hath made me
free from the law of sin and @^.

8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak @E the
@R, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful @R, and
for sin, condemned sin in the @R: 8:4 That the @ceousness of the
law @B be fulfilled in us, who walk not @ the @R, but @
the Spirit.

8:5 For they that are @ the @R do mind the @ of the @R;
but they that are @ the Spirit the @ of the Spirit.

8:6 For to be carnally minded is @^; but to be spiritually minded
is life and @U.

8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity @
 God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, @" indeed can be.

8:8 So then they that are in the @R cannot please God.

8:9 But ye are not in the @R, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
@2, he is none of his.

8:10 And if @2 be in you, the body is dead @ of sin; but the
Spirit is life @ of @ceousness.

8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up @ from the dead dwell
in you, he that raised up @2 from the dead @ also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

8:12 @N, @3, we are debtors, not to the @R, to live
@ the @R.

8:13 For if ye live @ the @R, ye @ die: but if ye @E
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye @ live.

8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
God.

8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage @* to fear; but
ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
the @ of God: 8:17 And if @, then heirs; heirs of God,
and joint-heirs with @2; if so be that we suffer with him, that we
may be also glorified @?.

8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the @Y @ @ be revealed in us.

8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God.

8:20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, 8:21 Because the
creature itself also @ be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the @ of God.

8:22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain @? until now.

8:23 And not only they, but ourselves also, @ have the @Ofruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  8:25 But if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
what we @# pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings @ cannot be uttered.

8:27 And he that searcheth the @s knoweth what is the mind of the
Spirit, @ he maketh intercession for the saints @$ to the
will of God.

8:28 And we know that all @ work @? for good to them that
love God, to them who are the @, @$ to his purpose.

8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he @B be the @Oborn
@ many @3.

8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also @,: and whom
he @,, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.

8:31 What @ we then say to @ @? If God be for us, who can
be @
 us?  8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him
up for us all, how @ he not with him also freely give us all
@?  8:33 Who @ lay any @7 to the charge of God's elect? It
is God that justifieth.

8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is @2 that died, yea rather,
that is risen @*, who is even at the @c hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.

8:35 Who @ separate us from the love of @2? @ tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
@Q?  8:36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day
long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

8:37 Nay, in all @ @ we are more than conquerors @E him
that loved us.

8:38 For I am persuaded, that @" @^, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor @ present, nor @ to come,
8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any @C creature, @ be able to
separate us from the love of God, @ is in @2 @ our Lord.

9:1 I say the truth in @2, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost, 9:2 That I have @ heaviness and
continual sorrow in my @.

9:3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from @2 for my
@3, my kinsmen @$ to the @R: 9:4 Who are @ites;
to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the @Y, and the covenants, and
the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 9:5
Whose are the @s, and of whom as concerning the @R @2
came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
not all @, @ are of @: 9:7 Neither, @ they are the
seed of Abraham, are they all @: but, In Isaac @ thy seed
be @,.

9:8 That is, They @ are the @ of the @R, @ are not
the @ of God: but the @ of the promise are counted for
the seed.

9:9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
Sarah @ have a son.

9:10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
even by our @ Isaac; 9:11 (For the @ being not yet born,
@" having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God
@$ to election @B stand, not of works, but of him that
calleth;) 9:12 It was said unto her, The elder @ serve the
younger.

9:13 As it is written, @] have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

9:14 What @ we say then? Is @ un@ceousness with God? God
forbid.

9:15 For he @
 to @, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that sheweth mercy.

9:17 For the scripture @
 unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up, that I @B shew my power in thee, and that my
name @B be declared @Eout all the @.

9:18 @N hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will he hardeneth.

9:19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
hath resisted his will?  9:20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that
repliest @
 God? Shall the @7 formed say to him that formed
it, Why hast thou made me thus?  9:21 Hath not the potter power over
the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and @F
unto dishonour?  9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to
make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction: 9:23 And that he @B make known the
riches of his @Y on the vessels of mercy, @ he had afore
prepared unto @Y, 9:24 Even us, whom he hath @,, not of the
Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  9:25 As he @
 also in Osee, I
will call them my @, @ were not my @; and her beloved,
@ was not beloved.

9:26 And it @ come to pass, that in the @' where it was said
unto them, Ye are not my @; @ @ they be @, the
@ of the living God.

9:27 Esaias also crieth concerning @, Though the number of the
@ of @ be as the sand of the sea, a remnant @ be
saved: 9:28 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
@ceousness: @ a short work will the Lord make upon the @.

9:29 And as Esaias said @	, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

9:30 What @ we say then? That the Gentiles, @ followed not
@ @ceousness, have attained to @ceousness, even the
@ceousness @ is of faith.

9:31 But @, @ followed @ the law of @ceousness, hath
not attained to the law of @ceousness.

9:32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 9:33
As it is written, @., I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
offence: and whosoever believeth on him @ not be ashamed.

10:1 Brethren, my @'s desire and prayer to God for @ is, that
they @B be saved.

10:2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
@$ to knowledge.

10:3 For they being ignorant of God's @ceousness, and going @+
to establish @ own @ceousness, have not submitted @T
unto the @ceousness of God.

10:4 For @2 is the end of the law for @ceousness to @ one
that believeth.

10:5 For @ describeth the @ceousness @ is of the law, That
the man @ doeth @J @ @ live by them.

10:6 But the @ceousness @ is of faith @Keth on this wise,
Say not in @ @, Who @ ascend into @1? (that is, to
@( @2 down from above:) 10:7 Or, Who @ descend into the
deep? (that is, to @( up @2 @* from the dead.)  10:8 But
what @
 it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy @P, and in thy
@: that is, the word of faith, @ we preach; 10:9 That if thou
@ confess with thy @P the Lord @, and @ believe in
@ @ that God hath raised him from the dead, thou @ be
saved.

10:10 For with the @ man believeth unto @ceousness; and with
the @P confession is made unto salvation.

10:11 For the scripture @
, Whosoever believeth on him @ not be
ashamed.

10:12 For @ is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

10:13 For whosoever @ call upon the name of the Lord @ be
saved.

10:14 How then @ they call on him in whom they have not believed?
and how @ they believe in him of whom they have not @)? and how
@ they hear @S a preacher?  10:15 And how @ they preach,
except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of @U, and @( glad tidings of good
@!  10:16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias
@
, Lord, who hath believed our report?  10:17 So then faith cometh
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

10:18 But I say, Have they not @)? Yes verily, @ sound went
into all the @, and @ @5 unto the ends of the world.

10:19 But I say, Did not @ know? First @ @
, I will
provoke you to jealousy by them that are no @, and by a foolish
nation I will anger you.

10:20 But Esaias is very bold, and @
, I was @V of them that
sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not @ me.

10:21 But to @ he @
, All day long I have stretched @ my
@D unto a disobedient and gain@ @.

11:1 I say then, Hath God cast away his @? God forbid. For I also
am an @ite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

11:2 God hath not cast away his @ @ he foreknew. Wot ye not
what the scripture @
 of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God
@
 @ @, 11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and
digged down @ @\s; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

11:4 But what @
 the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
myself @H @: men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of
Baal.

11:5 Even so then at this present time also @ is a remnant
@$ to the election of grace.

11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: @Cwise grace is
no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace:
@Cwise work is no more work.

11:7 What then? @ hath not obtained that @ he seeketh for;
but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

11:8 (According as it is written, God hath @= them the spirit of
slumber, eyes that they @# not see, and ears that they @# not
hear;) unto this day.

11:9 And @ @
, Let @ table be made a snare, and a trap, and
a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: 11:10 Let @ eyes be
darkened, that they may not see, and bow down @ back alway.

11:11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they @# fall? God
forbid: but rather @E @ fall salvation is come unto the
Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

11:12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more @
fulness?  11:13 For I @K to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 11:14 If by any means
I may provoke to emulation them @ are my @R, and @B save
some of them.

11:15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
what @ the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  11:16
For if the @Ofruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root
be holy, so are the branches.

11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
wild olive tree, wert graffed in @ them, and with them partakest
of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 11:18 Boast not @
 the
branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root
thee.

11:19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I @B
be graffed in.

11:20 Well; @ of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 11:21 For if God
spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not
thee.

11:22 @. @fore the goodness and severity of God: on them @
fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his
goodness: @Cwise thou also @ be cut off.

11:23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, @ be
graffed in: for God is able to graff them in @*.

11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree @ is wild by
nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree:
how much more @ @, @ be the natural branches, be graffed
into @ own olive tree?  11:25 For I @L not, @3, that ye
@# be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye @# be wise in your own
conceits; that blindness in part is happened to @, until the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

11:26 And so all @ @ be saved: as it is written, There @
come out of Sion the Deliverer, and @ turn away ungodliness from
@]: 11:27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I @ take away
@ sins.

11:28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
as touching the election, they are beloved for the @'s sakes.

11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are @S repentance.

11:30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
obtained mercy @E @ unbelief: 11:31 Even so have @ also
now not believed, that @E your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

11:32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he @B have
mercy upon all.

11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
out!  11:34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been
his counsellor?  11:35 Or who hath @O @= to him, and it @ be
recompensed unto him @*?  11:36 For of him, and @E him, and to
him, are all @: to whom be @Y for ever. Amen.

12:1 I beseech you @fore, @3, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
@ is your reasonable service.

12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

12:3 For I say, @E the grace @= unto me, to @ man that is
@ you, not to think of @9 more highly than he ought to think;
but to think soberly, @$ as God hath dealt to @ man the
measure of faith.

12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
the same office: 12:5 So we, being many, are one body in @2, and
@ one members one of @F.

12:6 Having then gifts differing @$ to the grace that is @=
to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy @$ to the proportion
of faith; 12:7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that
teacheth, on teaching; 12:8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he
that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with
diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

12:9 Let love be @S dissimulation. Abhor that @ is evil;
cleave to that @ is good.

12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to @F with @Xly love; in
honour preferring one @F; 12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent
in spirit; serving the Lord; 12:12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in
tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 12:13 Distributing to the
necessity of saints; @= to hospitality.

12:14 Bless them @ persecute you: bless, and curse not.

12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

12:16 Be of the same mind one toward @F. Mind not high @,
but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide @ honest in the
sight of all men.

12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live @Uably with
all men.

12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give @'
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, @

the Lord.

12:20 @N if @ enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
him @b: for in so doing thou @ heap coals of fire on his head.

12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

13:1 Let @ soul be subject unto the higher powers. For @ is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

13:2 Whosoever @fore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God: and they that resist @ receive to @T damnation.

13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? do that @ is good, and thou
@ have praise of the same: 13:4 For he is the minister of God to
thee for good. But if thou do that @ is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the @Q in vain: for he is the minister of God, a
revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

13:5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
for conscience sake.

13:6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
ministers, attending continually upon this very @7.

13:7 Render @fore to all @ dues: tribute to whom tribute is
due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

13:8 Owe no man any @7, but to love one @F: for he that loveth
@F hath fulfilled the law.

13:9 For this, Thou @ not commit adultery, Thou @ not kill,
Thou @ not steal, Thou @ not bear false witness, Thou @
not covet; and if @ be any @C commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this @, namely, Thou @ love thy neighbour as
thyself.

13:10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: @fore love is the
fulfilling of the law.

13:11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us @fore
cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

13:13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
envying.

13:14 But put ye on the Lord @ @2, and make not provision for
the @R, to fulfil the lusts @of.

14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
disputations.

14:2 For one believeth that he may eat all @: @F, who is
weak, eateth herbs.

14:3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not
him @ eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

14:4 Who art thou that judgest @F man's @<? to his own
master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he @ be holden up: for God is
able to make him stand.

14:5 One man esteemeth one day above @F: @F esteemeth @
day alike. Let @ man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

14:7 For none of us liveth to @9, and no man dieth to @9.

14:8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,
we die unto the Lord: whether we live @fore, or die, we are the
Lord's.

14:9 For to this end @2 both died, and rose, and revived, that he
@B be Lord both of the dead and living.

14:10 But why dost thou judge thy @X? or why dost thou set at
nought thy @X? for we @ all stand @	 the judgment seat of
@2.

14:11 For it is written, As I live, @
 the Lord, @ knee @
bow to me, and @ tongue @ confess to God.

14:12 So then @ one of us @ give account of @9 to God.

14:13 Let us not @fore judge one @F any more: but judge this
rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
@X's way.

14:14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord @, that @ is
no@7 unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any @7 to be
unclean, to him it is unclean.

14:15 But if thy @X be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom @2 died.

14:16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17 For the kingdom
of God is not meat and @b; but @ceousness, and @U, and joy in
the Holy Ghost.

14:18 For he that in @ @ serveth @2 is acceptable to God,
and approved of men.

14:19 Let us @fore follow @ the @ @ make for @U,
and @ wherewith one may edify @F.

14:20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All @ indeed are
pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

14:21 It is good @" to eat @R, nor to @b wine, nor any
@7 whereby thy @X stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

14:22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself @	 God. Happy is he that
condemneth not @9 in that @7 @ he alloweth.

14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, @ he eateth not
of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

15:1 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please ourselves.

15:2 Let @ one of us please his neighbour for his good to
edification.

15:3 For even @2 pleased not @9; but, as it is written, The
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

15:4 For whatsoever @ were written aforetime were written for our
learning, that we @E patience and comfort of the scriptures @B
have hope.

15:5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
likeminded one toward @F @$ to @2 @: 15:6 That ye
may with one mind and one @P glorify God, even the Father of our
Lord @ @2.

15:7 Wherefore receive ye one @F, as @2 also received us to
the @Y of God.

15:8 Now I say that @ @2 was a minister of the circumcision
for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the @s:
15:9 And that the Gentiles @B glorify God for his mercy; as it is
written, For this cause I will confess to thee @ the Gentiles, and
sing unto thy name.

15:10 And @* he @
, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his @.

15:11 And @*, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
ye @.

15:12 And @*, Esaias @
, There @ be a root of Jesse, and he
that @ rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him @ the Gentiles
trust.

15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and @U in
believing, that ye may abound in hope, @E the power of the Holy
Ghost.

15:14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my @3, that ye also
are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish
one @F.

15:15 Nevertheless, @3, I have written the more boldly unto you
in some sort, as putting you in mind, @ of the grace that is
@= to me of God, 15:16 That I @# be the minister of @
@2 to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the
@& up of the Gentiles @B be acceptable, being sanctified by
the Holy Ghost.

15:17 I have @fore whereof I may @Y @E @ @2 in
@J @ @ pertain to God.

15:18 For I will not dare to @K of any of @J @ @ @2
hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed, 15:19 Through @By signs and wonders, by the power of the
Spirit of God; so that from @ , and round @+ unto Illyricum,
I have fully preached the gospel of @2.

15:20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where @2
was named, lest I @# build upon @F man's @Vation: 15:21
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they @ see:
and they that have not @) @ @[stand.

15:22 For @ cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
you.

15:23 But now having no more @' in @ parts, and having a @
desire @ many @8 to come unto you; 15:24 Whensoever I take my
journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my
journey, and to be @ on my way thitherward by you, if @O I be
somewhat filled with your company.

15:25 But now I go unto @  to minister unto the saints.

15:26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
certain contribution for the poor saints @ are at @ .

15:27 It hath pleased them verily; and @ debtors they are. For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of @ spiritual @, @
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal @.

15:28 When @fore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

15:29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I @ come in the
fulness of the blessing of the gospel of @2.

15:30 Now I beseech you, @3, for the Lord @ @2's sake,
and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive @? with me in
your prayers to God for me; 15:31 That I may be delivered from them
that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service @ I have for
@  may be accepted of the saints; 15:32 That I may come unto
you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

15:33 Now the God of @U be with you all. Amen.

16:1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, @ is a @< of the
church @ is at Cenchrea: 16:2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as
becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she
hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself
also.

16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in @2 @: 16:4 Who
have for my life laid down @ own necks: unto whom not only I give
thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in @ @. Salute my
well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the @Ofruits of Achaia unto @2.

16:6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

16:7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,
who are of note @ the apostles, who also were in @2 @	 me.

16:8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

16:9 Salute Urbane, our helper in @2, and Stachys my beloved.

16:10 Salute Apelles approved in @2. Salute them @ are of
Aristobulus' @hold.

16:11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the @hold
of Narcissus, @ are in the Lord.

16:12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the
beloved Persis, @ laboured much in the Lord.

16:13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his m@C and mine.

16:14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
@3 @ are with them.

16:15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
Olympas, and all the saints @ are with them.

16:16 Salute one @F with an holy kiss. The churches of @2
salute you.

16:17 Now I beseech you, @3, mark them @ cause divisions and
offences contrary to the doctrine @ ye have learned; and avoid
them.

16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord @ @2, but
@ own belly; and by good @5 and fair speeches deceive the
@s of the simple.

16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
@fore on your behalf: but yet I @L have you wise unto that
@ is good, and simple concerning evil.

16:20 And the God of @U @ bruise Satan @[ your feet shortly.
The grace of our Lord @ @2 be with you. Amen.

16:21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
my kinsmen, salute you.

16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

16:23 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus
the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a @X.

16:24 The grace of our Lord @ @2 be with you all. Amen.

16:25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you @$ to my
gospel, and the preaching of @ @2, @$ to the revelation
of the mystery, @ was kept secret since the world began, 16:26 But
now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, @$
to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations
for the obedience of faith: 16:27 To God only wise, be @Y @E
@ @2 for ever. Amen.




The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians


1:1 Paul @, to be an apostle of @ @2 @E the will of
God, and Sosthenes our @X, 1:2 Unto the church of God @ is at
Corinth, to them that are sanctified in @2 @, @, to be
saints, with all that in @ @' call upon the name of @
@2 our Lord, both @'s and our's: 1:3 Grace be unto you, and
@U, from God our Father, and from the Lord @ @2.

1:4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God @
is @= you by @ @2; 1:5 That in @ @7 ye are enriched
by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; 1:6 Even as the
testimony of @2 was confirmed in you: 1:7 So that ye come behind
in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord @ @2: 1:8 Who
@ also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the
day of our Lord @ @2.

1:9 God is faithful, by whom ye were @, unto the fellowship of his
Son @ @2 our Lord.

1:10 Now I beseech you, @3, by the name of our Lord @
@2, that ye all @K the same @7, and that @ be no
divisions @ you; but that ye be perfectly joined @? in the
same mind and in the same judgment.

1:11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my @3, by them
@ are of the @ of Chloe, that @ are contentions @ you.

1:12 Now this I say, that @ one of you @
, I am of Paul; and I
of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of @2.

1:13 Is @2 divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
baptized in the name of Paul?  1:14 I thank God that I baptized none
of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 1:15 Lest any @# say that I had
baptized in mine own name.

1:16 And I baptized also the @hold of Stephanas: besides, I know
not whether I baptized any @C.

1:17 For @2 sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
with wisdom of @5, lest the cross of @2 @# be made of none
effect.

1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us @ are saved it is the power of God.

1:19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
will @( to no@7 the @[standing of the prudent.

1:20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of
this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  1:21
For @ that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
believe.

1:22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek @ wisdom:
1:23 But we preach @2 crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; 1:24 But unto them @ are @,,
both Jews and Greeks, @2 the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men.

1:26 For ye see your calling, @3, how that not many wise men
@ the @R, not many @By, not many noble, are @,: 1:27 But
God hath chosen the foolish @ of the world to con@V the wise;
and God hath chosen the weak @ of the world to con@V the
@ @ are @By; 1:28 And base @ of the world, and @
@ are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and @ @ are not, to
@( to nought @ that are: 1:29 That no @R @# @Y in
his presence.

1:30 But of him are ye in @2 @, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, and @ceousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 1:31
That, @$ as it is written, He that glorieth, let him @Y in
the Lord.

2:1 And I, @3, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

2:2 For I determined not to know any @7 @ you, save @
@2, and him crucified.

2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
trembling.

2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing @5 of
man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 2:5
That your faith @# not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.

2:6 Howbeit we @K wisdom @ them that are perfect: yet not the
wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
nought: 2:7 But we @K the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, @ God ordained @	 the world unto our @Y: 2:8
Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it,
they @L not have crucified the Lord of @Y.

2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear @), @"
have entered into the @ of man, the @ @ God hath prepared
for them that love him.

2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
searcheth all @, yea, the deep @ of God.

2:11 For what man knoweth the @ of a man, save the spirit of man
@ is in him? even so the @ of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God.

2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
@ is of God; that we @B know the @ that are freely @=
to us of God.

2:13 Which @ also we @K, not in the @5 @ man's wisdom
teacheth, but @ the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
@ with spiritual.

2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the @ of the Spirit of
God: for they are foolishness unto him: @" can he know them,
@ they are spiritually discerned.

2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all @, yet he @9 is
judged of no man.

2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
him?  But we have the mind of @2.

3:1 And I, @3, could not @K unto you as unto spiritual, but
as unto carnal, even as unto babes in @2.

3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it, @" yet now are ye able.

3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas @ is @ you envying, and
strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?  3:4 For
while one @
, I am of Paul; and @F, I am of Apollos; are ye
not carnal?  3:5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers
by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to @ man?  3:6 I have
planted, Apollos @Zed; but God gave the increase.

3:7 So then @" is he that planteth any @7, @" he that
@Zeth; but God that giveth the increase.

3:8 Now he that planteth and he that @Zeth are one: and @ man
@ receive his own reward @$ to his own labour.

3:9 For we are labourers @? with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye
are God's building.

3:10 According to the grace of God @ is @= unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the @Vation, and @F buildeth
@on. But let @ man take heed how he buildeth @upon.

3:11 For @C @Vation can no man lay than that is laid, @ is
@ @2.

3:12 Now if any man build upon this @Vation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble; 3:13 Every man's work @ be made
manifest: for the day @ declare it, @ it @ be revealed
by fire; and the fire @ try @ man's work of what sort it is.

3:14 If any man's work abide @ he hath built @upon, he @
receive a reward.

3:15 If any man's work @ be burned, he @ suffer loss: but he
@9 @ be saved; yet so as by fire.

3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you?  3:17 If any man defile the temple of God, him
@ God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, @ temple ye are.

3:18 Let no man deceive @9. If any man @ you seemeth to be
wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
written, He taketh the wise in @ own craftiness.

3:20 And @*, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
are vain.

3:21 @N let no man @Y in men. For all @ are your's;
3:22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
@^, or @ present, or @ to come; all are your's; 3:23 And
ye are @2's; and @2 is God's.

4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of @2, and
stewards of the mysteries of God.

4:2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be @V faithful.

4:3 But with me it is a very small @7 that I @# be judged of
you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

4:4 For I know no@7 by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but
he that judgeth me is the Lord.

4:5 @N judge no@7 @	 the time, until the Lord come, who
both will @( to light the hidden @ of darkness, and will make
manifest the counsels of the @s: and then @ @ man have
praise of God.

4:6 And @ @, @3, I have in a figure transferred to
myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye @B learn in us not to
think of men above that @ is written, that no one of you be puffed
up for one @
 @F.

4:7 For who maketh thee to differ from @F? and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost
thou @Y, as if thou hadst not received it?  4:8 Now ye are full,
now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings @S us: and I @L to
God ye did reign, that we also @B reign with you.

4:9 For I think that God hath set @ us the apostles last, as it
were appointed to @^: for we are made a spectacle unto the world,
and to angels, and to men.

4:10 We are fools for @2's sake, but ye are wise in @2; we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling@'; 4:12 And
labour, working with our own @D: being reviled, we bless; being
persecuted, we suffer it: 4:13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made
as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all @ unto
this day.

4:14 I write not @ @ to shame you, but as my beloved sons I
warn you.

4:15 For though ye have ten @: instructers in @2, yet have
ye not many @s: for in @2 @ I have begotten you @E
the gospel.

4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
son, and faithful in the Lord, who @ @( you into remembrance of
my ways @ be in @2, as I teach @ where in @ church.

4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I @L not come to you.

4:19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
not the speech of them @ are puffed up, but the power.

4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

4:21 What will ye? @ I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
in the spirit of meekness?  5:1 It is reported commonly that @ is
fornication @ you, and such fornication as is not so much as named
@ the Gentiles, that one @# have his @'s wife.

5:2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that
hath done this deed @B be taken away from @ you.

5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so
done this deed, 5:4 In the name of our Lord @ @2, when ye are
ga@d @?, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord @
@2, 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
the @R, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord @.

5:6 Your @Ying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump?  5:7 Purge out @fore the old leaven,
that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even @2 our
passover is sacrificed for us: 5:8 @N let us keep the feast,
not with old leaven, @" with the leaven of malice and wickedness;
but with the unleavened @d of sincerity and truth.

5:9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
5:10 Yet not al@? with the fornicators of this world, or with
the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye
needs go out of the world.

5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
that is @, a @X be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater,
or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not
to eat.

5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are @S? do not
ye judge them that are within?  5:13 But them that are @S God
judgeth. @N put away from @ yourselves that wicked person.

6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter @
 @F, go to law @	
the unjust, and not @	 the saints?  6:2 Do ye not know that the
saints @ judge the world? and if the world @ be judged by you,
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  6:3 Know ye not that
we @ judge angels? how much more @ that pertain to this life?
6:4 If then ye have judgments of @ pertaining to this life, set
them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

6:5 I @K to your shame. Is it so, that @ is not a wise man
@ you? no, not one that @ be able to judge between his
@3?  6:6 But @X goeth to law with @X, and that @	
the unbelievers.

6:7 Now @fore @ is utterly a fault @ you, @ ye go to
law one with @F. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not
rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  6:8 Nay, ye do wrong, and
defraud, and that your @3.

6:9 Know ye not that the un@ceous @ not inherit the kingdom of
God?  Be not deceived: @" fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of @T with mankind,
6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, @ inherit the kingdom of God.

6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord @, and by
the Spirit of our God.

6:12 All @ are lawful unto me, but all @ are not expedient:
all @ are lawful for me, but I will not be @ @[ the
power of any.

6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God @
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for
the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

6:14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us
by his own power.

6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of @2? @ I
then take the members of @2, and make them the members of an
harlot? God forbid.

6:16 What? know ye not that he @ is joined to an harlot is one
body?  for two, @
 he, @ be one @R.

6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is @S the body;
but he that committeth fornication sinneth @
 his own body.

6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
@ is in you, @ ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  6:20
For ye are bought with a price: @fore glorify God in your body,
and in your spirit, @ are God's.

7:1 Now concerning the @ whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for
a man not to touch a woman.

7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let @ man have his own
wife, and let @ woman have her own husband.

7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
also the wife unto the husband.

7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the
wife.

7:5 Defraud ye not one the @C, except it be with consent for a
time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come
@? @*, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

7:6 But I @K this by permission, and not of commandment.

7:7 For I @L that all men were even as I myself. But @ man hath
his proper gift of God, one @ this manner, and @F @ that.

7:8 I say @fore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
if they abide even as I.

7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to
marry than to burn.

7:10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
the wife depart from her husband: 7:11 But and if she depart, let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the
husband put away his wife.

7:12 But to the rest @K I, not the Lord: If any @X hath a wife
that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not
put her away.

7:13 And the woman @ hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your @
unclean; but now are they holy.

7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A @X or a
sister is not @[ bondage in such cases: but God hath @, us to
@U.

7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou @ save thy
husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou @ save thy
wife?  7:17 But as God hath distributed to @ man, as the Lord hath
@, @ one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

7:18 Is any man @, being circumcised? let him not become
uncircumcised. Is any @, in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.

7:19 Circumcision is no@7, and uncircumcision is no@7, but the
keeping of the commandments of God.

7:20 Let @ man abide in the same calling wherein he was @,.

7:21 Art thou @, being a @<? care not for it: but if thou
mayest be made free, use it rather.

7:22 For he that is @, in the Lord, being a @<, is the Lord's
freeman: likewise also he that is @,, being free, is @2's
@<.

7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the @<s of men.

7:24 Brethren, let @ man, wherein he is @,, @in abide with
God.

7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I
give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
faithful.

7:26 I suppose @fore that this is good for the present distress, I
say, that it is good for a man so to be.

7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

7:28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such @ have trouble in
the @R: but I spare you.

7:29 But this I say, @3, the time is short: it remaineth, that
both they that have wives be as though they had none; 7:30 And they
that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though
they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion
of this world passeth away.

7:32 But I @L have you @S carefulness. He that is unmarried
careth for the @ that belong to the Lord, how he may please the
Lord: 7:33 But he that is married careth for the @ that are of
the world, how he may please his wife.

7:34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
unmarried woman careth for the @ of the Lord, that she may be
holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for
the @ of the world, how she may please her husband.

7:35 And this I @K for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
upon you, but for that @ is comely, and that ye may attend upon
the Lord @S distraction.

7:36 But if any man think that he behaveth @9 uncomely toward his
virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let
him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.

7:37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his @, having no
necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in
his @ that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

7:38 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she
will; only in the Lord.

7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, @ my judgment: and I
think also that I have the Spirit of God.

8:1 Now as touching @ offered unto idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any @7, he knoweth no@7
yet as he ought to know.

8:3 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

8:4 As concerning @fore the eating of @J @ that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is no@7 in
the world, and that @ is none @C God but one.

8:5 For though @ be that are @, gods, whether in @1 or in
@, (as @ be gods many, and lords many,) 8:6 But to us @ is
but one God, the Father, of whom are all @, and we in him; and
one Lord @ @2, by whom are all @, and we by him.

8:7 Howbeit @ is not in @ man that knowledge: for some with
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a @7 offered unto
an idol; and @ conscience being weak is defiled.

8:8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for @", if we eat, are we
the better; @", if we eat not, are we the worse.

8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a
stumblingblock to them that are weak.

8:10 For if any man see thee @ hast knowledge sit at meat in the
idol's temple, @ not the conscience of him @ is weak be
emboldened to eat @J @ @ are offered to idols; 8:11 And
@E thy knowledge @ the weak @X perish, for whom @2
died?  8:12 But when ye sin so @
 the @3, and wound @
weak conscience, ye sin @
 @2.

8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my @X to offend, I will eat no @R
while the world standeth, lest I make my @X to offend.

9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen @ @2
our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?  9:2 If I be not an apostle
unto @Cs, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine
apostleship are ye in the Lord.

9:3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 9:4 Have we not
power to eat and to @b?  9:5 Have we not power to lead @+ a
sister, a wife, as well as @C apostles, and as the @3 of the
Lord, and Cephas?  9:6 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to
forbear working?  9:7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?
who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit @of? or who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  9:8 Say I
@ @ as a man? or @
 not the law the same also?  9:9 For it
is written in the law of @, Thou @ not muzzle the @P of the
ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?  9:10 Or
@
 he it al@? for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is
written: that he that ploweth @# plow in hope; and that he that
thresheth in hope @# be partaker of his hope.

9:11 If we have sown unto you spiritual @, is it a @ @7 if
we @ reap your carnal @?  9:12 If @Cs be partakers of this
power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this
power; but suffer all @, lest we @# hinder the gospel of
@2.

9:13 Do ye not know that they @ minister @+ holy @ live of
the @ of the temple? and they @ wait at the @\ are
partakers with the @\?  9:14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that
they @ preach the gospel @# live of the gospel.

9:15 But I have used none of @ @: @" have I written
@ @, that it @# be so done unto me: for it were better
for me to die, than that any man @# make my @Ying void.

9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have no@7 to @Y of: for
necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the
gospel!  9:17 For if I do this @7 willingly, I have a reward: but
if @
 my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.

9:18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I
may make the gospel of @2 @S charge, that I abuse not my
power in the gospel.

9:19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself @<
unto all, that I @B gain the more.

9:20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I @B gain the Jews;
to them that are @[ the law, as @[ the law, that I @B gain
them that are @[ the law; 9:21 To them that are @S law, as
@S law, (being not @S law to God, but @[ the law to
@2,) that I @B gain them that are @S law.

9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I @B gain the weak: I am
made all @ to all men, that I @B by all means save some.

9:23 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I @B be partaker
@of with you.

9:24 Know ye not that they @ run in a race run all, but one
receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

9:25 And @ man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
@. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an
incorruptible.

9:26 I @fore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
that beateth the air: 9:27 But I keep @[ my body, and @( it into
subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to @Cs, I
myself @# be a castaway.

10:1 Moreover, @3, I @L not that ye @# be ignorant, how
that all our @s were @[ the cloud, and all passed @E the
sea; 10:2 And were all baptized unto @ in the cloud and in the
sea; 10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 10:4 And did all
@b the same spiritual @b: for they drank of that spiritual Rock
that followed them: and that Rock was @2.

10:5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
overthrown in the wilderness.

10:6 Now @ @ were our examples, to the intent we @# not
lust @ evil @, as they also lusted.

10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
The @ sat down to eat and @b, and rose up to play.

10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
fell in one day @@ and twenty @:.

10:9 Neither let us tempt @2, as some of them also tempted, and
were destroyed of serpents.

10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
destroyed of the destroyer.

10:11 Now all @ @ happened unto them for ensamples: and they
are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
come.

10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
fall.

10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.

10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

10:15 I @K as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

10:16 The cup of blessing @ we bless, is it not the communion of
the @I of @2? The @d @ we break, is it not the communion
of the body of @2?  10:17 For we being many are one @d, and one
body: for we are all partakers of that one @d.

10:18 @. @ @ the @R: are not they @ eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the @\?  10:19 What say I then? that the
idol is any @7, or that @ is offered in sacrifice to idols is
any @7?  10:20 But I say, that the @ @ the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I @L not
that ye @# have fellowship with devils.

10:21 Ye cannot @b the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
10:23 All @ are lawful for me, but all @ are not expedient:
all @ are lawful for me, but all @ edify not.

10:24 Let no man seek his own, but @ man @F's wealth.

10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question
for conscience sake: 10:26 For the @ is the Lord's, and the
fulness @of.

10:27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
disposed to go; whatsoever is set @	 you, eat, asking no question
for conscience sake.

10:28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:
for the @ is the Lord's, and the fulness @of: 10:29
Conscience, I say, not @ own, but of the @C: for why is my
liberty judged of @F man's conscience?  10:30 For if I by grace
be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for @ I give
thanks?  10:31 Whether @fore ye eat, or @b, or whatsoever ye
do, do all to the @Y of God.

10:32 Give none offence, @" to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
to the church of God: 10:33 Even as I please all men in all @,
not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be
saved.

11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of @2.

11:2 Now I praise you, @3, that ye remember me in all @,
and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

11:3 But I @L have you know, that the head of @ man is @2;
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of @2 is God.

11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
dishonoureth his head.

11:5 But @ woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she
were shaven.

11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
the image and @Y of God: but the woman is the @Y of the man.

11:8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
man.

11:10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head @
of the angels.

11:11 Nevertheless @" is the man @S the woman, @" the
woman @S the man, in the Lord.

11:12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
woman; but all @ of God.

11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered?  11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a
man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?  11:15 But if a woman have
long hair, it is a @Y to her: for her hair is @= her for a
covering.

11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
@" the churches of God.

11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
come @? not for the better, but for the worse.

11:18 For @O of all, when ye come @? in the church, I hear
that @ be divisions @ you; and I partly believe it.

11:19 For @ must be also heresies @ you, that they @ are
approved may be made manifest @ you.

11:20 When ye come @? @fore into one @', this is not to
eat the Lord's supper.

11:21 For in eating @ one taketh @	 @C his own supper: and
one is hungry, and @F is drunken.

11:22 What? have ye not @s to eat and to @b in? or despise ye
the church of God, and shame them that have not? What @ I say to
you? @ I praise you in this? I praise you not.

11:23 For I have received of the Lord that @ also I delivered unto
you, That the Lord @ the same night in @ he was betrayed took
@d: 11:24 And when he had @= thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat: this is my body, @ is broken for you: this do in
remembrance of me.

11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
@, This cup is the new testament in my @I: this do ye, as oft
as ye @b it, in remembrance of me.

11:26 For as often as ye eat this @d, and @b this cup, ye do
shew the Lord's @^ till he come.

11:27 Wherefore whosoever @ eat this @d, and @b this cup of
the Lord, unworthily, @ be guilty of the body and @I of the
Lord.

11:28 But let a man examine @9, and so let him eat of that @d,
and @b of that cup.

11:29 For he that eateth and @beth unworthily, eateth and @beth
damnation to @9, not discerning the Lord's body.

11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly @ you, and many
sleep.

11:31 For if we @L judge ourselves, we @# not be judged.

11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
@# not be condemned with the world.

11:33 Wherefore, my @3, when ye come @? to eat, tarry one
for @F.

11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
@? unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I
come.

12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, @3, I @L not have you
ignorant.

12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto @ dumb
idols, even as ye were led.

12:3 Wherefore I give you to @[stand, that no man @King by the
Spirit of God calleth @ accursed: and that no man can say that
@ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

12:4 Now @ are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

12:5 And @ are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

12:6 And @ are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
@ worketh all in all.

12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is @= to @ man to
profit withal.

12:8 For to one is @= by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to @F
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 12:9 To @F faith by the
same Spirit; to @F the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 12:10
To @F the working of miracles; to @F prophecy; to @F
discerning of spirits; to @F divers kinds of tongues; to @F
the interpretation of tongues: 12:11 But all @ worketh that one
and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to @ man severally as he will.

12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is @2.

12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all
made to @b into one Spirit.

12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.

12:15 If the foot @ say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it @fore not of the body?  12:16 And if the ear @
say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it @fore
not of the body?  12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the
hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  12:18
But now hath God set the members @ one of them in the body, as it
hath pleased him.

12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?  12:20 But
now are they many members, yet but one body.

12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
nor @* the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

12:22 Nay, much more @J members of the body, @ seem to be more
feeble, are necessary: 12:23 And @J members of the body, @ we
think to be less honourable, upon @ we bestow more abundant
honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
body @?, having @= more abundant honour to that part @
lacked.

12:25 That @ @# be no schism in the body; but that the members
@# have the same care one for @F.

12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

12:27 Now ye are the body of @2, and members in particular.

12:28 And God hath set some in the church, @O apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, @ that miracles, then gifts of
healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
workers of miracles?  12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all
@K with tongues? do all interpret?  12:31 But covet earnestly the
best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.

13:1 Though I @K with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and @[stand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I
could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am no@7.

13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
no@7.

13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 13:5 Doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil; 13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7
Beareth all @, believeth all @, hopeth all @, endureth
all @.

13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether @ be prophecies, they
@ fail; whether @ be tongues, they @ cease; whether @
be knowledge, it @ vanish away.

13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

13:10 But when that @ is perfect is come, then that @ is in
part @ be done away.

13:11 When I was a child, I @0 as a child, I @[stood as a child,
I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish
@.

13:12 For now we see @E a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
now I know in part; but then @ I know even as also I am known.

13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, @ @@; but the
@est of @ is charity.

14:1 Follow @ charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
ye may prophesy.

14:2 For he that @Keth in an unknown tongue @Keth not unto men,
but unto God: for no man @[standeth him; howbeit in the spirit he
@Keth mysteries.

14:3 But he that prophesieth @Keth unto men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

14:4 He that @Keth in an unknown tongue edifieth @9; but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church.

14:5 I @L that ye all @0 with tongues but rather that ye
prophesied: for @er is he that prophesieth than he that @Keth
with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive
edifying.

14:6 Now, @3, if I come unto you @King with tongues, what
@ I profit you, except I @ @K to you either by revelation,
or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  14:7 And even
@ @S life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they
give a distinction in the sounds, how @ it be known what is piped
or harped?  14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who @
prepare @9 to the battle?  14:9 So likewise ye, except ye utter
by the tongue @5 easy to be @[stood, how @ it be known what
is spoken? for ye @ @K into the air.

14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of @;s in the world, and
none of them is @S signification.

14:11 @N if I know not the meaning of the @;, I @ be
unto him that @Keth a barbarian, and he that @Keth @ be a
barbarian unto me.

14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

14:13 Wherefore let him that @Keth in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret.

14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
@[standing is unfruitful.

14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
with the @[standing also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will
sing with the @[standing also.

14:16 Else when thou @ bless with the spirit, how @ he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he @[standeth not what thou sayest?  14:17 For thou verily
givest thanks well, but the @C is not edified.

14:18 I thank my God, I @K with tongues more than ye all: 14:19 Yet
in the church I had rather @K five @5 with my @[standing,
that by my @; I @B teach @Cs also, than ten @: @5 in
an unknown tongue.

14:20 Brethren, be not @ in @[standing: howbeit in malice be
ye @, but in @[standing be men.

14:21 In the law it is written, With men of @C tongues and @C
lips will I @K unto this @; and yet for all that will they not
hear me, @
 the LORD.

14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that
believe not, but for them @ believe.

14:23 If @fore the whole church be come @? into one @',
and all @K with tongues, and @ come in @J that are
unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  14:24
But if all prophesy, and @ come in one that believeth not, or one
unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 14:25 And thus
are the secrets of his @ made manifest; and so falling down on his
face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

14:26 How is it then, @3? when ye come @?, @ one of
you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation,
hath an interpretation. Let all @ be done unto edifying.

14:27 If any man @K in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
the most by @@, and that by course; and let one interpret.

14:28 But if @ be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
church; and let him @K to @9, and to God.

14:29 Let the prophets @K two or @@, and let the @C judge.

14:30 If any @7 be revealed to @F that sitteth by, let the
@O hold his @U.

14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted.

14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of @U, as in all
churches of the saints.

14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted unto them to @K; but they are @M to be @[
obedience as also @
 the law.

14:35 And if they will learn any @7, let them ask @ husbands at
home: for it is a shame for women to @K in the church.

14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
only?  14:37 If any man think @9 to be a prophet, or spiritual,
let him acknowledge that the @ that I write unto you are the
commandments of the Lord.

14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

14:39 Wherefore, @3, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to @K
with tongues.

14:40 Let all @ be done decently and in order.

15:1 Moreover, @3, I declare unto you the gospel @ I
preached unto you, @ also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
15:2 By @ also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

15:3 For I delivered unto you @O of all that @ I also received,
how that @2 died for our sins @$ to the scriptures; 15:4
And that he was buried, and that he rose @* the third day @$
to the scriptures: 15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the
twelve: 15:6 After that, he was seen of above five @/ @3 at
once; of whom the @er part remain unto this present, but some are
fallen asleep.

15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
time.

15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be @,
an apostle, @ I persecuted the church of God.

15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace @ was
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the grace of God @ was with me.

15:11 @N whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
believed.

15:12 Now if @2 be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
some @ you that @ is no resurrection of the dead?  15:13 But
if @ be no resurrection of the dead, then is @2 not risen:
15:14 And if @2 be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
faith is also vain.

15:15 Yea, and we are @V false witnesses of God; @ we have
testified of God that he raised up @2: whom he raised not up, if
so be that the dead rise not.

15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not @2 raised: 15:17 And
if @2 be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

15:18 Then they also @ are fallen asleep in @2 are perished.

15:19 If in this life only we have hope in @2, we are of all men
most miserable.

15:20 But now is @2 risen from the dead, and become the
@Ofruits of them that slept.

15:21 For since by man came @^, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead.

15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in @2 @ all be made
alive.

15:23 But @ man in his own order: @2 the @Ofruits;
@ward they that are @2's at his coming.

15:24 Then cometh the end, when he @ have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he @ have put down all rule and all
authority and power.

15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies @[ his feet.

15:26 The last enemy that @ be destroyed is @^.

15:27 For he hath put all @ @[ his feet. But when he @
 all
@ are put @[ him, it is manifest that he is excepted, @
did put all @ @[ him.

15:28 And when all @ @ be subdued unto him, then @ the
Son also @9 be subject unto him that put all @ @[ him,
that God may be all in all.

15:29 Else what @ they do @ are baptized for the dead, if the
dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  15:30
And why stand we in jeopardy @ hour?  15:31 I protest by your
rejoicing @ I have in @2 @ our LORD, I die daily.

15:32 If @ the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and @b;
for to morrow we die.

15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

15:34 Awake to @ceousness, and sin not; for some have not the
knowledge of God: I @K this to your shame.

15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
body do they come?  15:36 Thou fool, that @ thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die: 15:37 And that @ thou sowest, thou
sowest not that body that @ be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some @C grain: 15:38 But God giveth it a body as it
hath pleased him, and to @ seed his own body.

15:39 All @R is not the same @R: but @ is one kind of @R
of men, @F @R of beasts, @F of fishes, and @F of
birds.

15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
@Y of the celestial is one, and the @Y of the terrestrial is
@F.

15:41 There is one @Y of the sun, and @F @Y of the moon,
and @F @Y of the stars: for one star differeth from @F
star in @Y.

15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 15:43 It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in @Y: it is sown in weakness; it is raised
in power: 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and @ is a spiritual body.

15:45 And so it is written, The @O man Adam was made a living soul;
the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

15:46 Howbeit that was not @O @ is spiritual, but that @ is
natural; and @ward that @ is spiritual.

15:47 The @O man is of the @, @y; the second man is the
Lord from @1.

15:48 As is the @y, such are they also that are @y: and as is
the @1ly, such are they also that are @1ly.

15:49 And as we have borne the image of the @y, we @ also bear
the image of the @1ly.

15:50 Now this I say, @3, that @R and @I cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; @" doth corruption inherit incorruption.

15:51 @., I shew you a mystery; We @ not all sleep, but we
@ all be changed, 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the last trump: for the trumpet @ sound, and the dead @ be
raised incorruptible, and we @ be changed.

15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality.

15:54 So when this corruptible @ have put on incorruption, and
this mortal @ have put on immortality, then @ be @ to
pass the @ that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

15:55 O @^, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
15:56 The sting of @^ is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

15:57 But thanks be to God, @ giveth us the victory @E our
Lord @ @2.

15:58 @N, my beloved @3, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have @=
order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

16:2 Upon the @O day of the week let @ one of you lay by him in
store, as God hath prospered him, that @ be no gatherings when I
come.

16:3 And when I come, whomsoever ye @ approve by your letters,
them will I send to @( your liberality unto @ .

16:4 And if it be meet that I go also, they @ go with me.

16:5 Now I will come unto you, when I @ pass @E Macedonia:
for I do pass @E Macedonia.

16:6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that
ye may @( me on my journey whithersoever I go.

16:7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
while with you, if the Lord permit.

16:8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

16:9 For a @ door and effectual is opened unto me, and @ are
many adversaries.

16:10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you @S fear:
for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

16:11 Let no man @fore despise him: but conduct him @ in
@U, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the @3.

16:12 As touching our @X Apollos, I @ly desired him to come
unto you with the @3: but his will was not at all to come at
this time; but he will come when he @ have convenient time.

16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

16:14 Let all your @ be done with charity.

16:15 I beseech you, @3, (ye know the @ of Stephanas, that
it is the @Ofruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted
@T to the ministry of the saints,) 16:16 That ye submit
yourselves unto such, and to @ one that helpeth with us, and
laboureth.

16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus: for that @ was lacking on your part they have supplied.

16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: @fore
acknowledge ye them that are such.

16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
much in the Lord, with the church that is in @ @.

16:20 All the @3 greet you. Greet ye one @F with
an holy kiss.

16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

16:22 If any man love not the Lord @ @2, let him be
Anathema Maranatha.

16:23 The grace of our Lord @ @2 be with you.

16:24 My love be with you all in @2 @. Amen.




The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians


1:1 Paul, an apostle of @ @2 by the will of God, and Timothy
our @X, unto the church of God @ is at Corinth, with all the
saints @ are in all Achaia: 1:2 Grace be to you and @U from God
our Father, and from the Lord @ @2.

1:3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord @ @2, the
Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 1:4 Who comforteth us
in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them @ are
in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
God.

1:5 For as the sufferings of @2 abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by @2.

1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
salvation, @ is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
@ we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
consolation and salvation.

1:7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
of the sufferings, so @ ye be also of the consolation.

1:8 For we @L not, @3, have you ignorant of our trouble @
came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 1:9 But we had the
sentence of @^ in ourselves, that we @# not trust in ourselves,
but in God @ raiseth the dead: 1:10 Who delivered us from so @
a @^, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
us; 1:11 Ye also helping @? by prayer for us, that for the gift
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be @= by
many on our behalf.

1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that
in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with @Rly wisdom, but by the
grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more
abundantly to you-ward.

1:13 For we write none @C @ unto you, than what ye read or
acknowledge; and I trust ye @ acknowledge even to the end; 1:14 As
also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even
as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord @.

1:15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you @	, that
ye @B have a second benefit; 1:16 And to pass by you into
Macedonia, and to come @* out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to
be @ on my way toward Judaea.

1:17 When I @fore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
@ that I purpose, do I purpose @$ to the @R, that with
me @ @# be yea yea, and nay nay?  1:18 But as God is true, our
word toward you was not yea and nay.

1:19 For the Son of God, @ @2, who was preached @ you by
us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in
him was yea.

1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
the @Y of God by us.

1:21 Now he @ stablisheth us with you in @2, and hath anointed
us, is God; 1:22 Who hath also sealed us, and @= the earnest of the
Spirit in our @s.

1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
your joy: for by faith ye stand.

2:1 But I determined this with myself, that I @L not come @* to
you in heaviness.

2:2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but
the same @ is made sorry by me?  2:3 And I wrote this same unto
you, lest, when I came, I @# have sorrow from them of whom I ought
to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of
you all.

2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of @ I wrote unto you
with many tears; not that ye @# be grieved, but that ye @B know
the love @ I have more abundantly unto you.

2:5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
that I may not overcharge you all.

2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, @ was inflicted
of many.

2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one @# be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow.

2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye @L confirm your love toward
him.

2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I @B know the proof of
you, whether ye be obedient in all @.

2:10 To whom ye forgive any @7, I forgive also: for if I forgave
any @7, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the
person of @2; 2:11 Lest Satan @# get an advantage of us: for
we are not ignorant of his devices.

2:12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach @2's gospel, and
a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 2:13 I had no rest in my
spirit, @ I @V not Titus my @X: but taking my leave of
them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

2:14 Now thanks be unto God, @ always causeth us to triumph in
@2, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in @
@'.

2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of @2, in them that are
saved, and in them that perish: 2:16 To the one we are the savour of
@^ unto @^; and to the @C the savour of life unto life. And
who is sufficient for @ @?  2:17 For we are not as many,
@ corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the sight of God @K we in @2.

3:1 Do we begin @* to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
@Cs, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
from you?  3:2 Ye are our epistle written in our @s, known and
read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of @2 ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in @Ry tables
of the @.

3:4 And such trust have we @E @2 to God-ward: 3:5 Not that we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any @7 as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of
the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

3:7 But if the ministration of @^, written and engraven in stones,
was glorious, so that the @ of @ could not stedfastly
@% the face of @ for the @Y of his countenance; @ @Y
was to be done away: 3:8 How @ not the ministration of the spirit
be rather glorious?  3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation be
@Y, much more doth the ministration of @ceousness exceed in
@Y.

3:10 For even that @ was made glorious had no @Y in this
respect, by reason of the @Y that excelleth.

3:11 For if that @ is done away was glorious, much more that @
remaineth is glorious.

3:12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use @ plainness of
speech: 3:13 And not as @, @ put a vail over his face, that
the @ of @ could not stedfastly look to the end of that
@ is abolished: 3:14 But @ minds were blinded: for until this
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
testament; @ vail is done away in @2.

3:15 But even unto this day, when @ is read, the vail is upon
@ @.

3:16 Nevertheless when it @ turn to the Lord, the vail @ be
taken away.

3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
@ is liberty.

3:18 But we all, with open face @%ing as in a glass the @Y of
the Lord, are changed into the same image from @Y to @Y, even as
by the Spirit of the LORD.

4:1 @N seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
we faint not; 4:2 But have renounced the hidden @ of dishonesty,
not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to @ man's
conscience in the sight of God.

4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 In
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them @
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of @2, who is
the image of God, @# shine unto them.

4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but @2 @ the Lord; and
ourselves your @<s for @' sake.

4:6 For God, who @M the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our @s, to give the light of the knowledge of the @Y
of God in the face of @ @2.

4:7 But we have this treasure in @en vessels, that the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us.

4:8 We are troubled on @ side, yet not distressed; we are
perplexed, but not in despair; 4:9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast
down, but not destroyed; 4:10 Always bearing @+ in the body the
dying of the Lord @, that the life also of @ @B be made
manifest in our body.

4:11 For we @ live are alway delivered unto @^ for @' sake,
that the life also of @ @B be made manifest in our mortal
@R.

4:12 So then @^ worketh in us, but life in you.

4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, @$ as it is written, I
believed, and @fore have I spoken; we also believe, and @fore
@K; 4:14 Knowing that he @ raised up the Lord @ @ raise
up us also by @, and @ present us with you.

4:15 For all @ are for your sakes, that the abundant grace @B
@E the thanksgiving of many redound to the @Y of God.

4:16 For @ cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

4:17 For our light affliction, @ is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of @Y; 4:18 While we
look not at the @ @ are seen, but at the @ @ are not
seen: for the @ @ are seen are temporal; but the @ @
are not seen are eternal.

5:1 For we know that if our @ly @ of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an @ not made with @D,
eternal in the @1s.

5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
our @ @ is from @1: 5:3 If so be that being clothed we
@ not be @V naked.

5:4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not
for that we @L be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality @B
be swallowed up of life.

5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame @7 is God, who
also hath @= unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

5:6 @N we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 5:7 (For we walk by
faith, not by sight:) 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather
to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
accepted of him.

5:10 For we must all appear @	 the judgment seat of @2; that
@ one may receive the @ done in his body, @$ to that
he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

5:11 Knowing @fore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we
are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your
consciences.

5:12 For we commend not ourselves @* unto you, but give you
occasion to @Y on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer
them @ @Y in appearance, and not in @.

5:13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we
be sober, it is for your cause.

5:14 For the love of @2 constraineth us; @ we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead: 5:15 And that he died
for all, that they @ live @# not hence@ live unto
@T, but unto him @ died for them, and rose @*.

5:16 Wherefore hence@ know we no man @ the @R: yea, though
we have known @2 @ the @R, yet now hence@ know we him
no more.

5:17 @N if any man be in @2, he is a new creature: old
@ are passed away; @%, all @ are become new.

5:18 And all @ are of God, who hath reconciled us to @9 by
@ @2, and hath @= to us the ministry of reconciliation;
5:19 To wit, that God was in @2, reconciling the world unto
@9, not imputing @ trespasses unto them; and hath committed
unto us the word of reconciliation.

5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for @2, as though God did beseech
you by us: we pray you in @2's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
@B be made the @ceousness of God in him.

6:1 We then, as workers @? with him, beseech you also that ye
receive not the grace of God in vain.

6:2 (For he @
, I have @) thee in a time accepted, and in the
day of salvation have I succoured thee: @%, now is the accepted
time; @%, now is the day of salvation.)  6:3 Giving no offence in
any @7, that the ministry be not blamed: 6:4 But in all @
approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in
afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 6:5 In stripes, in
imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 6:6
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
Ghost, by love unfeigned, 6:7 By the word of truth, by the power of
God, by the armour of @ceousness on the @c hand and on the left,
6:8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
deceivers, and yet true; 6:9 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and, @%, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 6:10 As sorrowful,
yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having no@7,
and yet possessing all @.

6:11 O ye Corinthians, our @P is open unto you, our @ is
enlarged.

6:12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
bowels.

6:13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I @K as unto my @,)
be ye also enlarged.

6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked @? with unbelievers: for what
fellowship hath @ceousness with un@ceousness? and what communion
hath light with darkness?  6:15 And what concord hath @2 with
Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  6:16 And
what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
walk in them; and I will be @ God, and they @ be my @.

6:17 Wherefore come out from @ them, and be ye separate, @
 the
Lord, and touch not the unclean @7; and I will receive you.

6:18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye @ be my sons and
daughters, @
 the Lord Al@By.

7:1 Having @fore @ promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all fil@ss of the @R and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.

7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
have defrauded no man.

7:3 I @K not this to condemn you: for I have said @	, that ye
are in our @s to die and live with you.

7:4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, @ is my @Ying of
you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our
tribulation.

7:5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our @R had no rest, but
we were troubled on @ side; @S were fightings, within were
fears.

7:6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth @J that are cast down,
comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7:7 And not by his coming only,
but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told
us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so
that I rejoiced the more.

7:8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you
sorry, though it were but for a season.

7:9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
to repentance: for ye were made sorry @ a godly manner, that ye
@B receive damage by us in no@7.

7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh @^.

7:11 For @% this selfsame @7, that ye sorrowed @ a godly
sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement
desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all @ ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.

7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but
that our care for you in the sight of God @B appear unto you.

7:13 @N we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, @ his spirit was
refreshed by you all.

7:14 For if I have boasted any @7 to him of you, I am not ashamed;
but as we @0 all @ to you in truth, even so our boasting,
@ I made @	 Titus, is @V a truth.

7:15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye
received him.

7:16 I rejoice @fore that I have confidence in you in all @.

8:1 Moreover, @3, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
on the churches of Macedonia; 8:2 How that in a @ trial of
affliction the abundance of @ joy and @ deep poverty abounded
unto the riches of @ liberality.

8:3 For to @ power, I bear record, yea, and beyond @ power
they were willing of @T; 8:4 Praying us with much intreaty
that we @L receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the
ministering to the saints.

8:5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but @O gave @ own
selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

8:6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he @L
also finish in you the same grace also.

8:7 @N, as ye abound in @ @7, in faith, and utterance,
and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that
ye abound in this grace also.

8:8 I @K not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
@Cs, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord @ @2, that, though he
was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye @E his
poverty @B be rich.

8:10 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who
have begun @	, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

8:11 Now @fore perform the doing of it; that as @ was a
readiness to will, so @ may be a performance also out of that
@ ye have.

8:12 For if @ be @O a willing mind, it is accepted @$ to
that a man hath, and not @$ to that he hath not.

8:13 For I mean not that @C men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But
by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply
for @ want, that @ abundance also may be a supply for your
want: that @ may be equality: 8:15 As it is written, He that had
ga@d much had no@7 over; and he that had ga@d little had no
lack.

8:16 But thanks be to God, @ put the same earnest care into the
@ of Titus for you.

8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
of his own accord he went unto you.

8:18 And we have sent with him the @X, whose praise is in the
gospel @Eout all the churches; 8:19 And not that only, but who
was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace,
@ is administered by us to the @Y of the same Lord, and
declaration of your ready mind: 8:20 Avoiding this, that no man @#
blame us in this abundance @ is administered by us: 8:21 Providing
for honest @, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the
sight of men.

8:22 And we have sent with them our @X, whom we have oftentimes
proved diligent in many @, but now much more diligent, upon the
@ confidence @ I have in you.

8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
fellowhelper concerning you: or our @3 be enquired of, they are
the messengers of the churches, and the @Y of @2.

8:24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and @	 the churches, the proof of
your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you: 9:2 For I know the forwardness of your mind,
for @ I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a
year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.

9:3 Yet have I sent the @3, lest our boasting of you @# be
in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 9:4 Lest
haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we
(that we say not, ye) @# be ashamed in this same confident
boasting.

9:5 @N I thought it necessary to exhort the @3, that they
@L go @	 unto you, and make up @	hand your bounty, whereof
ye had notice @	, that the same @B be ready, as a matter of
bounty, and not as of covetousness.

9:6 But this I say, He @ soweth sparingly @ reap also
sparingly; and he @ soweth bountifully @ reap also
bountifully.

9:7 Every man @$ as he purposeth in his @, so let him give;
not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
always having all sufficiency in all @, may abound to @ good
work: 9:9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath @=
to the poor: his @ceousness remaineth for ever.

9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister @d for
your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of
your @ceousness;) 9:11 Being enriched in @ @7 to all
bountifulness, @ causeth @E us thanksgiving to God.

9:12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
God; 9:13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify
God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of @2, and for
your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; 9:14 And by
@ prayer for you, @ long @ you for the exceeding grace of
God in you.

9:15 Thanks be unto God for his un@Kable gift.

10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
@2, who in presence am base @ you, but being absent am bold
toward you: 10:2 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am
present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold @

some, @ think of us as if we walked @$ to the @R.

10:3 For though we walk in the @R, we do not war @ the @R:
10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but @By
@E God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 10:5 Casting down
imaginations, and @ high @7 that exalteth itself @
 the
knowledge of God, and @(ing into captivity @ thought to the
obedience of @2; 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all
disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

10:7 Do ye look on @ @ the outward appearance? If any man
trust to @9 that he is @2's, let him of @9 think this
@*, that, as he is @2's, even so are we @2's.

10:8 For though I @# boast somewhat more of our authority, @
the Lord hath @= us for edification, and not for your destruction,
I @# not be ashamed: 10:9 That I may not seem as if I @L
terrify you by letters.

10:10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

10:11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are
present.

10:12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
ourselves with some that commend @T: but they measuring
@T by @T, and comparing @T @ @T,
are not wise.

10:13 But we will not boast of @ @S our measure, but
@$ to the measure of the rule @ God hath distributed to us,
a measure to reach even unto you.

10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
preaching the gospel of @2: 10:15 Not boasting of @ @S
our measure, that is, of @C men's labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increased, that we @ be enlarged by you @$ to
our rule abundantly, 10:16 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond
you, and not to boast in @F man's line of @ made ready to
our hand.

10:17 But he that glorieth, let him @Y in the Lord.

10:18 For not he that commendeth @9 is approved, but whom the
Lord commendeth.

11:1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
indeed bear with me.

11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
to @2.

11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
@E his subtilty, so your minds @# be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in @2.

11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth @F @, whom we have not
preached, or if ye receive @F spirit, @ ye have not received,
or @F gospel, @ ye have not accepted, ye @B well bear with
him.

11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

11:6 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
been @Ely made manifest @ you in all @.

11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye @B be
exalted, @ I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
11:8 I robbed @C churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

11:9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to
no man: for that @ was lacking to me the @3 @ came from
Macedonia supplied: and in all @ I have kept myself from being
burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.

11:10 As the truth of @2 is in me, no man @ stop me of this
boasting in the regions of Achaia.

11:11 Wherefore? @ I love you not? God knoweth.

11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from
them @ desire occasion; that wherein they @Y, they may be @V
even as we.

11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
@T into the apostles of @2.

11:14 And no marvel; for Satan @9 is transformed into an angel of
light.

11:15 @N it is no @ @7 if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of @ceousness; whose end @ be
@$ to @ works.

11:16 I say @*, Let no man think me a fool; if @Cwise, yet as a
fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

11:17 That @ I @K, I @K it not @ the Lord, but as it
were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

11:18 Seeing that many @Y @ the @R, I will @Y also.

11:19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

11:20 For ye suffer, if a man @( you into bondage, if a man devour
you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt @9, if a man smite you
on the face.

11:21 I @K as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I @K foolishly,) I am bold
also.

11:22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they @ites? so am I. Are
they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

11:23 Are they ministers of @2? (I @K as a fool) I am more; in
labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more
frequent, in @^s oft.

11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 11:26
In journeyings often, in perils of @Zs, in perils of robbers, in
perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in
the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
@ false @3; 11:27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

11:28 Beside @J @ that are @S, that @ cometh upon me
daily, the care of all the churches.

11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
11:30 If I must needs @Y, I will @Y of the @ @ concern
mine infirmities.

11:31 The God and Father of our Lord @ @2, @ is blessed

11:32 In Damascus the governor @[ Aretas the king kept the city of
the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 11:33 And
@E a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped
his @D.

12:1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to @Y. I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord.

12:2 I knew a man in @2 above fourteen @8 ago, (whether in the
body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God
knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third @1.

12:3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body,
I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 12:4 How that he was caught up into
paradise, and @) un@Kable @5, @ it is not lawful for a

12:5 Of such an one will I @Y: yet of myself I will not @Y, but
in mine infirmities.

12:6 For though I @L desire to @Y, I @ not be a fool; for I
will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man @# think of me
above that @ he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

12:7 And lest I @# be exalted above measure @E the abundance
of the revelations, @ was @= to me a thorn in the @R, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I @# be exalted above
measure.

12:8 For this @7 I besought the Lord thrice, that it @B depart
from me.

12:9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly @fore will I
rather @Y in my infirmities, that the power of @2 may rest upon
me.

12:10 @N I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for @2's sake: for
when I am weak, then am I strong.

12:11 I am become a fool in @Ying; ye have compelled me: for I
ought to have been commended of you: for in no@7 am I behind the
very chiefest apostles, though I be no@7.

12:12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought @ you in all
patience, in signs, and wonders, and @By deeds.

12:13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to @C churches,
except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this
wrong.

12:14 @., the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the @
ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the @.

12:15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

12:16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,
I caught you with guile.

12:17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
12:18 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a @X. Did Titus make a
gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the
same steps?  12:19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?
we @K @	 God in @2: but we do all @, dearly beloved,
for your edifying.

12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I @ not find you such as I
@L, and that I @ be @V unto you such as ye @L not: lest
@ be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,
swellings, tumults: 12:21 And lest, when I come @*, my God will
humble me @ you, and that I @ bewail many @ have sinned
already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
lasciviousness @ they have committed.

13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the @P of two or

13:2 I told you @	, and foretell you, as if I were present, the

have sinned, and to all @C, that, if I come @*, I will not
spare: 13:3 Since ye seek a proof of @2 @King in me, @ to
you-ward is not weak, but is @By in you.

13:4 For though he was crucified @E weakness, yet he liveth by
the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we @ live with
him by the power of God toward you.

13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that @ @2 is in you,
except ye be reprobates?  13:6 But I trust that ye @ know that we

13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we @# appear
approved, but that ye @# do that @ is honest, though we be as
reprobates.

13:8 For we can do no@7 @
 the truth, but for the truth.

13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
also we wish, even your perfection.

13:10 @N I write @ @ being absent, lest being present
I @# use sharpness, @$ to the power @ the Lord hath

13:11 Finally, @3, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be

13:12 Greet one @F with an holy kiss.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians


1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, @" by man, but by @
@2, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 1:2 And all
the @3 @ are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 1:3
Grace be to you and @U from God the Father, and from our Lord @
@2, 1:4 Who gave @9 for our sins, that he @B deliver us
from this present evil world, @$ to the will of God and our
Father: 1:5 To whom be @Y for ever and ever. Amen.

1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that @, you into
the grace of @2 unto @F gospel: 1:7 Which is not @F; but
@ be some that trouble you, and @L pervert the gospel of
@2.

1:8 But though we, or an angel from @1, preach any @C gospel
unto you than that @ we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.

1:9 As we said @	, so say I now @*, if any man preach any @C
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
for if I yet pleased men, I @# not be the @< of @2.

1:11 But I certify you, @3, that the gospel @ was preached
of me is not @ man.

1:12 For I @" received it of man, @" was I taught it, but by
the revelation of @ @2.

1:13 For ye have @) of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it: 1:14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my
equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my @s.

1:15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my m@C's womb,
and @, me by his grace, 1:16 To reveal his Son in me, that I @B
preach him @ the heathen; immediately I conferred not with @R
and @I: 1:17 Neither went I up to @  to them @ were
apostles @	 me; but I went into Arabia, and returned @* unto
Damascus.

1:18 Then @ @@ @8 I went up to @  to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days.

1:19 But @C of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
@X.

1:20 Now the @ @ I write unto you, @%, @	 God, I lie
not.

1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22 And
was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea @ were in @2:
1:23 But they had @) only, That he @ persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith @ once he destroyed.

1:24 And they glorified God in me.

2:1 Then fourteen @8 @ I went up @* to @  with
Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

2:2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
gospel @ I preach @ the Gentiles, but privately to them @
were of reputation, lest by any means I @# run, or had run, in
vain.

2:3 But @" Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
to be circumcised: 2:4 And that @ of false @3 unawares
@ in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty @ we have
in @2 @, that they @B @( us into bondage: 2:5 To whom we
gave @' by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the
gospel @B continue with you.

2:6 But of @ who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who
seemed to be somewhat in conference added no@7 to me: 2:7 But
contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was
committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
2:8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
the circumcision, the same was @By in me toward the Gentiles:) 2:9
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace that was @= unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
@c @D of fellowship; that we @# go unto the heathen, and
they unto the circumcision.

2:10 Only they @L that we @# remember the poor; the same @
I also was forward to do.

2:11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
@ he was to be blamed.

2:12 For @	 that certain came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated @9,
fearing them @ were of the circumcision.

2:13 And the @C Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
Barnabas also was carried away with @ dissimulation.

2:14 But when I saw that they walked not up@cly @$ to the
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter @	 them all, If thou, being
a Jew, livest @ the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews,
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  2:15 We who
are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 2:16 Knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of
@ @2, even we have believed in @ @2, that we @B be
justified by the faith of @2, and not by the works of the law: for
by the works of the law @ no @R be justified.

2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by @2, we ourselves
also are @V sinners, is @fore @2 the minister of sin? God
forbid.

2:18 For if I build @* the @ @ I destroyed, I make myself
a transgressor.

2:19 For I @E the law am dead to the law, that I @B live unto
God.

2:20 I am crucified with @2: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
@2 liveth in me: and the life @ I now live in the @R I live
by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave @9 for me.

2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if @ceousness come by
the law, then @2 is dead in vain.

3:1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye @# not
obey the truth, @	 whose eyes @ @2 hath been evidently set
@, crucified @ you?  3:2 This only @L I learn of you,
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?  3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now
made perfect by the @R?  3:4 Have ye suffered so many @ in
vain? if it be yet in vain.

3:5 He @fore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles @ you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
hearing of faith?  3:6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for @ceousness.

3:7 Know ye @fore that they @ are of faith, the same are the
@ of Abraham.

3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God @L justify the heathen
@E faith, preached @	 the gospel unto Abraham, @, In
thee @ all nations be blessed.

3:9 So then they @ be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are @[ the curse:
for it is written, Cursed is @ one that continueth not in all
@ @ are written in the book of the law to do them.

3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
is evident: for, The just @ live by faith.

3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them @
live in them.

3:13 @2 hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is @ one that hangeth on a
tree: 3:14 That the blessing of Abraham @B come on the Gentiles
@E @ @2; that we @B receive the promise of the Spirit
@E faith.

3:15 Brethren, I @K @ the manner of men; Though it be but a
man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth
@to.

3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He @
 not,
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, @ is
@2.

3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed @	 of
God in @2, the law, @ was four @/ and thirty @8 @,
cannot disannul, that it @# make the promise of none effect.

3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added @ of
transgressions, till the seed @# come to whom the promise was
made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

3:21 Is the law then @
 the promises of God? God forbid: for if
@ had been a law @= @ could have @= life, verily
@ceousness @# have been by the law.

3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all @[ sin, that the promise
by faith of @ @2 @B be @= to them that believe.

3:23 But @	 faith came, we were kept @[ the law, shut up unto
the faith @ @# @wards be revealed.

3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to @( us unto @2,
that we @B be justified by faith.

3:25 But @ that faith is come, we are no longer @[ a
schoolmaster.

3:26 For ye are all the @ of God by faith in @2 @.

3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into @2 have put on
@2.

3:28 There is @" Jew nor Greek, @ is @" bond nor free,
@ is @" male nor female: for ye are all one in @2 @.

3:29 And if ye be @2's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
@$ to the promise.

4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
no@7 from a @<, though he be lord of all; 4:2 But is @[
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the @.

4:3 Even so we, when we were @, were in bondage @[ the
elements of the world: 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent @ his Son, made of a woman, made @[ the law, 4:5 To
redeem them that were @[ the law, that we @B receive the
adoption of sons.

4:6 And @ ye are sons, God hath sent @ the Spirit of his Son
into your @s, crying, Abba, Father.

4:7 Wherefore thou art no more a @<, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God @E @2.

4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them @
by nature are no gods.

4:9 But now, @ that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
how turn ye @* to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
desire @* to be in bondage?  4:10 Ye observe days, and months, and
times, and @8.

4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
not injured me at all.

4:13 Ye know how @E infirmity of the @R I preached the gospel
unto you at the @O.

4:14 And my temptation @ was in my @R ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as @2 @.

4:15 Where is then the blessedness ye @0 of? for I bear you record,
that, if it had been possible, ye @L have plucked out your own
eyes, and have @= them to me.

4:16 Am I @fore become your enemy, @ I tell you the truth?
4:17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they @L exclude
you, that ye @B affect them.

4:18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good @7,
and not only when I am present with you.

4:19 My little @, of whom I travail in birth @* until @2
be formed in you, 4:20 I desire to be present with you now, and to
change my @;; for I stand in doubt of you.

4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be @[ the law, do ye not hear the
law?  4:22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the @C by a freewoman.

4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born @ the @R; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.

4:24 Which @ are an allegory: for @ are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, @ gendereth to bondage, @ is
Agar.

4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
@  @ now is, and is in bondage with her @.

4:26 But @  @ is above is free, @ is the m@C of us
all.

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
@ and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
more @ than she @ hath an husband.

4:28 Now we, @3, as Isaac was, are the @ of promise.

4:29 But as then he that was born @ the @R persecuted him that
was born @ the Spirit, even so it is now.

4:30 Nevertheless what @
 the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman @ not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.

4:31 So then, @3, we are not @ of the bondwoman, but of
the free.

5:1 Stand fast @fore in the liberty wherewith @2 hath made us
free, and be not entangled @* with the yoke of bondage.

5:2 @., I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, @2
@ profit you no@7.

5:3 For I testify @* to @ man that is circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.

5:4 @2 is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

5:5 For we @E the Spirit wait for the hope of @ceousness by
faith.

5:6 For in @ @2 @" circumcision availeth any @7, nor
uncircumcision; but faith @ worketh by love.

5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye @# not obey the
truth?  5:8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

5:10 I have confidence in you @E the Lord, that ye will be none
@Cwise minded: but he that troubleth you @ bear his judgment,
whosoever he be.

5:11 And I, @3, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

5:12 I @L they were even cut off @ trouble you.

5:13 For, @3, ye have been @, unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the @R, but by love serve one @F.

5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
@ love thy neighbour as thyself.

5:15 But if ye bite and devour one @F, take heed that ye be not
consumed one of @F.

5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye @ not fulfil the
lust of the @R.

5:17 For the @R lusteth @
 the Spirit, and the Spirit @

the @R: and @ are contrary the one to the @C: so that ye
cannot do the @ that ye @L.

5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not @[ the law.

5:19 Now the works of the @R are manifest, @ are @;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 5:20 Idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies, 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like: of the @ I tell you @	, as I have also told you in time
past, that they @ do such @ @ not inherit the kingdom of
God.

5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, @U, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, 5:23 Meekness, temperance: @
 such
@ is no law.

5:24 And they that are @2's have crucified the @R with the
affections and lusts.

5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain @Y, provoking one @F,
envying one @F.

6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye @ are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

6:2 Bear ye one @F's burdens, and so fulfil the law of @2.

6:3 For if a man think @9 to be some@7, when he is no@7, he
deceiveth @9.

6:4 But let @ man prove his own work, and then @ he have
rejoicing in @9 alone, and not in @F.

6:5 For @ man @ bear his own burden.

6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good @.

6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
that @ he also reap.

6:8 For he that soweth to his @R @ of the @R reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit @ of the Spirit reap
life everlasting.

6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we @
reap, if we faint not.

6:10 As we have @fore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the @hold of faith.

6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
hand.

6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the @R, they
constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they @# suffer
persecution for the cross of @2.

6:13 For @" they @T who are circumcised keep the law; but
desire to have you circumcised, that they may @Y in your @R.

6:14 But God forbid that I @# @Y, save in the cross of our Lord
@ @2, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.

6:15 For in @2 @ @" circumcision availeth any @7, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature.

6:16 And as many as walk @$ to this rule, @U be on them, and
mercy, and upon the @ of God.

6:17 From hence@ let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
marks of the Lord @.

6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord @ @2 be with your spirit.

Amen.

abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 1:9 Having made known
unto us the mystery of his will, @$ to his good pleasure @
he hath purposed in @9: 1:10 That in the dispensation of the
fulness of times he @B gather @? in one all @ in @2,
both @ are in @1, and @ are on @; even in him: 1:11 In
whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
@$ to the purpose of him who worketh all @ @ the

1:13 In whom ye also trusted, @ that ye @) the word of truth,
the gospel of your salvation: in whom also @ that ye believed, ye
were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 1:14 Which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession, unto the praise of his @Y.

1:15 Wherefore I also, @ I @) of your faith in the Lord @,
and love unto all the saints, 1:16 Cease not to give thanks for you,
making mention of you in my prayers; 1:17 That the God of our Lord
@ @2, the Father of @Y, may give unto you the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 1:18 The eyes of your
@[standing being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of
his calling, and what the riches of the @Y of his inheritance in
the saints, 1:19 And what is the exceeding @ness of his power to
us-ward who believe, @$ to the working of his @By power,
1:20 Which he wrought in @2, when he raised him from the dead, and
set him at his own @c hand in the @1ly @'s, 1:21 Far above
all principality, and power, and @B, and dominion, and @ name
that is named, not only in this world, but also in that @ is to
come: 1:22 And hath put all @ @[ his feet, and gave him to be
the head over all @ to the church, 1:23 Which is his body, the
fulness of him that filleth all in all.

2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked @$ to the course of this
world, @$ to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the @ of disobedience: 2:3 Among whom also
we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our @R,
fulfilling the desires of the @R and of the mind; and were by
nature the @ of wrath, even as @Cs.

2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his @ love wherewith he
loved us, 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
@? with @2, (by grace ye are saved;) 2:6 And hath raised us
up @?, and made us sit @? in @1ly @'s in @2
@: 2:7 That in the ages to come he @B shew the exceeding riches
of his grace in his kindness toward us @E @2 @.

2:8 For by grace are ye saved @E faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God: 2:9 Not of works, lest any man
@# boast.

2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in @2 @ unto good
works, @ God hath @	 ordained that we @# walk in them.

2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
@R, who are @, Uncircumcision by that @ is @, the
Circumcision in the @R made by @D; 2:12 That at that time ye
were @S @2, being aliens from the commonwealth of @, and
strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and @S
God in the world: 2:13 But now in @2 @ ye who sometimes were
far off are made nigh by the @I of @2.

2:14 For he is our @U, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
the middle wall of partition between us; 2:15 Having abolished in his
@R the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in
ordinances; for to make in @9 of twain one new man, so making
@U; 2:16 And that he @B reconcile both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the enmity @by: 2:17 And came and preached
@U to you @ were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

2:18 For @E him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
Father.

2:19 Now @fore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the @hold of God; 2:20 And
are built upon the @Vation of the apostles and prophets, @
@2 @9 being the chief corner stone; 2:21 In whom all the
building fitly framed @? groweth unto an holy temple in the
Lord: 2:22 In whom ye also are builded @? for an habitation of
God @E the Spirit.

3:1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of @ @2 for you
Gentiles, 3:2 If ye have @) of the dispensation of the grace of God
@ is @= me to you-ward: 3:3 How that by revelation he made
known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few @5, 3:4
Whereby, when ye read, ye may @[stand my knowledge in the mystery
of @2) 3:5 Which in @C ages was not made known unto the sons of
men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the
Spirit; 3:6 That the Gentiles @# be fellowheirs, and of the same
body, and partakers of his promise in @2 by the gospel: 3:7
Whereof I was made a minister, @$ to the gift of the grace of
God @= unto me by the effectual working of his power.

3:8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
@=, that I @# preach @ the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
of @2; 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the
mystery, @ from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
who created all @ by @ @2: 3:10 To the intent that now
unto the principalities and powers in @1ly @'s @B be known
by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 3:11 According to the
eternal purpose @ he purposed in @2 @ our Lord: 3:12 In
whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
@ is your @Y.

3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord @
@2, 3:15 Of whom the whole family in @1 and @ is named,
3:16 That he @L grant you, @$ to the riches of his @Y, to
be strengthened with @B by his Spirit in the inner man; 3:17 That
@2 may dwell in your @s by faith; that ye, being rooted and
grounded in love, 3:18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what
is the @dth, and length, and depth, and height; 3:19 And to know
the love of @2, @ passeth knowledge, that ye @B be filled
with all the fulness of God.

3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think, @$ to the power that worketh in us, 3:21
Unto him be @Y in the church by @2 @ @Eout all ages,
world @S end. Amen.

4:1 I @fore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are @,, 4:2 With all lowliness
and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one @F in love; 4:3
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of @U.

4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are @, in one
hope of your calling; 4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 4:6 One
God and Father of all, who is above all, and @E all, and in you
all.

4:7 But unto @ one of us is @= grace @$ to the measure
of the gift of @2.

4:8 Wherefore he @
, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.

4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended @O
into the lower parts of the @?  4:10 He that descended is the same
also that ascended up far above all @1s, that he @B fill all
@.)  4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and
some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 4:12 For the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of @2: 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of @2: 4:14 That we
hence@ be no more @, tossed to and fro, and carried @+
with @ wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 4:15 But @King the
truth in love, may grow up into him in all @, @ is the head,
even @2: 4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined @? and
compacted by that @ @ joint supplieth, @$ to the
effectual working in the measure of @ part, maketh increase of the
body unto the edifying of itself in love.

4:17 This I say @fore, and testify in the Lord, that ye hence@
walk not as @C Gentiles walk, in the vanity of @ mind, 4:18
Having the @[standing darkened, being alienated from the life of
God @E the ignorance that is in them, @ of the blindness of
@ @: 4:19 Who being past feeling have @= @T over
unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

4:20 But ye have not so learned @2; 4:21 If so be that ye have
@) him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in @: 4:22
That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, @
is corrupt @$ to the deceitful lusts; 4:23 And be renewed in
the spirit of your mind; 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, @
@ God is created in @ceousness and true holiness.

4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, @K @ man truth with his
neighbour: for we are members one of @F.

4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
wrath: 4:27 Neither give @' to the devil.

4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
working with his @D the @7 @ is good, that he may have to
give to him that needeth.

4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your @P, but that
@ is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers.

4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption.

4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
@King, be put away from you, with all malice: 4:32 And be ye kind
one to @F, tender@ed, forgiving one @F, even as God for
@2's sake hath for@= you.

5:1 Be ye @fore followers of God, as dear @; 5:2 And walk
in love, as @2 also hath loved us, and hath @= @9 for us
an @& and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
be once named @ you, as becometh saints; 5:4 Neither fil@ss,
nor foolish talking, nor jesting, @ are not convenient: but rather
giving of thanks.

5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of @2 and of God.

5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain @5: for @ of @
@ cometh the wrath of God upon the @ of disobedience.

5:7 Be not ye @fore partakers with them.

5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
walk as @ of light: 5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all
goodness and @ceousness and truth;) 5:10 Proving what is acceptable
unto the Lord.

5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
rather reprove them.

5:12 For it is a shame even to @K of @J @ @ are done of
them in secret.

5:13 But all @ that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

5:14 Wherefore he @
, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and @2 @ give thee light.

5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
5:16 Redeeming the time, @ the days are evil.

5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but @[standing what the will of
the Lord is.

5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
the Spirit; 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your @ to the Lord;
5:20 Giving thanks always for all @ unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord @ @2; 5:21 Submitting yourselves one to
@F in the fear of God.

5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord.

5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as @2 is the
head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

5:24 @N as the church is subject unto @2, so let the wives
be to @ own husbands in @ @7.

5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as @2 also loved the church,
and gave @9 for it; 5:26 That he @B sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of @Z by the word, 5:27 That he @B present it
to @9 a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
@7; but that it @# be holy and @S blemish.

5:28 So ought men to love @ wives as @ own bodies. He that
loveth his wife loveth @9.

5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own @R; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 5:30 For we are members of
his body, of his @R, and of his bones.

5:31 For this cause @ a man leave his @ and m@C, and @
be joined unto his wife, and they two @ be one @R.

5:32 This is a @ mystery: but I @K concerning @2 and the
church.

5:33 Nevertheless let @ one of you in particular so love his wife
even as @9; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is @c.

6:2 Honour thy @ and m@C; @ is the @O commandment with
promise; 6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long
on the @.

6:4 And, ye @s, provoke not your @ to wrath: but @(
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters @$ to
the @R, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your @, as
unto @2; 6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the
@<s of @2, doing the will of God from the @; 6:7 With
good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 6:8 Knowing
that whatsoever good @7 any man doeth, the same @ he receive of
the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

6:9 And, ye masters, do the same @ unto them, forbearing
threatening: knowing that your Master also is in @1; @" is
@ respect of persons with him.

6:10 Finally, my @3, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his @B.

6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
@
 the wiles of the devil.

6:12 For we wrestle not @
 @R and @I, but @

principalities, @
 powers, @
 the rulers of the darkness of
this world, @
 spiritual wickedness in high @'s.

6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

6:14 Stand @fore, having your loins girt @+ with truth, and
having on the breastplate of @ceousness; 6:15 And your feet shod
with the preparation of the gospel of @U; 6:16 Above all, taking
the shield of faith, wherewith ye @ be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked.

6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the @Q of the Spirit,
@ is the word of God: 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the Spirit, and watching @unto with all
perseverance and supplication for all saints; 6:19 And for me, that
utterance may be @= unto me, that I may open my @P boldly, to
make known the mystery of the gospel, 6:20 For @ I am an
ambassador in bonds: that @in I may @K boldly, as I ought to
@K.

6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
beloved @X and faithful minister in the Lord, @ make known to
you all @: 6:22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,
that ye @B know our affairs, and that he @B comfort your @s.

6:23 Peace be to the @3, and love with faith, from God the

6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord @ @2 in

Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians


1:1 Paul and Timotheus, the @<s of @ @2, to all the
saints in @2 @ @ are at Philippi, with the bishops and
deacons: 1:2 Grace be unto you, and @U, from God our Father, and
from the Lord @ @2.

1:3 I thank my God upon @ remembrance of you, 1:4 Always in @
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 1:5 For your
fellowship in the gospel from the @O day until now; 1:6 Being
confident of this very @7, that he @ hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of @ @2: 1:7 Even as it is
meet for me to think this of you all, @ I have you in my @;
inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of
the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

1:8 For God is my record, how @ly I long @ you all in the
bowels of @ @2.

1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and in all judgment; 1:10 That ye may approve @ that
are excellent; that ye may be sincere and @S offence till the day
of @2.

1:11 Being filled with the fruits of @ceousness, @ are by @
@2, unto the @Y and praise of God.

1:12 But I @L ye @# @[stand, @3, that the @ @
happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
gospel; 1:13 So that my bonds in @2 are manifest in all the
palace, and in all @C @'s; 1:14 And many of the @3 in the
Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to @K the
word @S fear.

1:15 Some indeed preach @2 even of envy and strife; and some also
of good will: 1:16 The one preach @2 of contention, not sincerely,
supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 1:17 But the @C of love,
knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.

1:18 What then? notwithstanding, @ way, whether in pretence, or in
truth, @2 is preached; and I @in do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice.

1:19 For I know that this @ turn to my salvation @E your
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of @ @2, 1:20 According
to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in no@7 I @ be
ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also @2
@ be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by @^.

1:21 For to me to live is @2, and to die is gain.

1:22 But if I live in the @R, this is the fruit of my labour: yet
what I @ choose I wot not.

1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and
to be with @2; @ is far better: 1:24 Nevertheless to abide in
the @R is more needful for you.

1:25 And having this confidence, I know that I @ abide and
continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 1:26 That
your rejoicing may be more abundant in @ @2 for me by my
coming to you @*.

1:27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
@2: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear
of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind
striving @? for the faith of the gospel; 1:28 And in no@7
terrified by your adversaries: @ is to them an evident token of
perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

1:29 For unto you it is @= in the behalf of @2, not only to
believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 1:30 Having the same
conflict @ ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

2:1 If @ be @fore any consolation in @2, if any comfort of
love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2:2
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being
of one accord, of one mind.

2:3 Let no@7 be done @E strife or vain@Y; but in lowliness
of mind let each esteem @C better than @T.

2:4 Look not @ man on his own @, but @ man also on the
@ of @Cs.

2:5 Let this mind be in you, @ was also in @2 @: 2:6 Who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
2:7 But made @9 of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
@<, and was made in the likeness of men: 2:8 And being @V in
fashion as a man, he humbled @9, and became obedient unto @^,
even the @^ of the cross.

2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and @= him a name
@ is above @ name: 2:10 That at the name of @ @ knee
@# bow, of @ in @1, and @ in @, and @ @[
the @; 2:11 And that @ tongue @# confess that @ @2
is Lord, to the @Y of God the Father.

2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.

2:13 For it is God @ worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure.

2:14 Do all @ @S murmurings and disputings: 2:15 That ye may
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, @S rebuke, in the
@a of a crooked and perverse nation, @ whom ye shine as lights
in the world; 2:16 Holding @ the word of life; that I may rejoice
in the day of @2, that I have not run in vain, @" laboured in
vain.

2:17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

2:18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

2:19 But I trust in the Lord @ to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

2:20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
state.

2:21 For all seek @ own, not the @ @ are @ @2's.

2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the @, he
hath served with me in the gospel.

2:23 Him @fore I hope to send presently, so soon as I @ see
how it will go with me.

2:24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself @ come shortly.

2:25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
@X, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

2:26 For he longed @ you all, and was full of heaviness, @
that ye had @) that he had been sick.

2:27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto @^: but God had mercy on him;
and not on him only, but on me also, lest I @# have sorrow upon
sorrow.

2:28 I sent him @fore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
@*, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

2:29 Receive him @fore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation: 2:30 Because for the work of @2 he was nigh
unto @^, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service
toward me.

3:1 Finally, my @3, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
@ to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.

3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

3:3 For we are the circumcision, @ worship God in the spirit, and
rejoice in @2 @, and have no confidence in the @R.

3:4 Though I @B also have confidence in the @R. If any @C man
thinketh that he hath whereof he @B trust in the @R, I more: 3:5
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of @, of the tribe of
Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
3:6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
@ceousness @ is in the law, blameless.

3:7 But what @ were gain to me, @J I counted loss for @2.

3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all @ but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of @2 @ my Lord: for whom I have suffered the
loss of all @, and do count them but dung, that I may win @2,
3:9 And be @V in him, not having mine own @ceousness, @ is
of the law, but that @ is @E the faith of @2, the
@ceousness @ is of God by faith: 3:10 That I may know him, and
the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
being made conformable unto his @^; 3:11 If by any means I @B
attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
perfect: but I follow @, if that I may apprehend that for @
also I am apprehended of @2 @.

3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
@7 I do, forgetting @J @ @ are behind, and reaching
@ unto @J @ @ are @	, 3:14 I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of God in @2 @.

3:15 Let us @fore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if
in any @7 ye be @Cwise minded, God @ reveal even this unto

3:16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
the same rule, let us mind the same @7.

3:17 Brethren, be followers @? of me, and mark them @ walk
so as ye have us for an ensample.

3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of @2: 3:19
Whose end is destruction, whose God is @ belly, and whose @Y is
in @ shame, who mind @ly @.)  3:20 For our conversation

@2: 3:21 Who @ change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body, @$ to the working whereby he is
able even to subdue all @ unto @9.

4:1 @N, my @3 dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

4:2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
mind in the Lord.

4:3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help @J women @
laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with @C my
fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and @* I say, Rejoice.

4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

4:6 Be careful for no@7; but in @ @7 by prayer and

4:8 Finally, @3, whatsoever @ are true, whatsoever @
are honest, whatsoever @ are just, whatsoever @ are pure,
whatsoever @ are lovely, whatsoever @ are of good report; if
@ be any virtue, and if @ be any praise, think on @

4:9 Those @, @ ye have both learned, and received, and @),

4:10 But I rejoiced in the Lord @ly, that now at the last your
care of me hath flourished @*; wherein ye were also careful, but ye
lacked opportunity.

4:11 Not that I @K in respect of want: for I have learned, in

4:12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: @
where and in all @ I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

4:13 I can do all @ @E @2 @ strengtheneth me.

4:14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with
my affliction.

4:15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and @* unto my
necessity.

4:17 Not @ I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
to your account.

4:18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
Epaphroditus the @ @ were sent from you, an odour of a sweet

4:19 But my God @ supply all your need @$ to his riches in

4:20 Now unto God and our Father be @Y for ever and ever. Amen.

4:21 Salute @ saint in @2 @. The @3 @ are with

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians


1:1  Paul, an apostle of @ @2 by the will of God,
and Timotheus our @X, 1:2  To the saints and faithful @3
in @2 @ are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and @U,

1:3  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord @ @2, praying

1:4  Since we @) of your faith in @2 @, and of the love @ ye

1:6  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and @(eth @

grace of God in truth:
1:7  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow@<, who is for you
a faithful minister of @2;
1:8  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

1:9  For this cause we also, since the day we @) it, do not cease to
pray for you, and to desire that ye @B be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual @[standing;
1:10  That ye @B walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being

1:11  Strengthened with all @B, @$ to his glorious power, unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
1:12  Giving thanks unto the Father, @ hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
1:13  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
1:14  In whom we have redemption @E his @I, even the for@=ess of
sins:
1:15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the @Oborn of @
creature:
1:16  For by him were all @ created, that are in @1, and that are
in @, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all @ were created by him, and for him:
1:17  And he is @	 all @, and by him all @ consist.

1:18  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the

1:21  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
1:22  In the body of his @R @E @^, to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
1:23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved

1:29  Whereunto I also labour, striving @$ to his working, @
worketh in me @Bily.

2:1  For I @L that ye knew what @ conflict I have for you, and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the @R;
2:2  That @ @s @B be comforted, being knit @? in love, and
unto all riches of the full assurance of @[standing, to the
acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of @2;
2:3  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

2:4  And this I say, lest any man @# beguile you with enticing @5.

2:5  For though I be absent in the @R, yet am I with you in the spirit,
joying and @%ing your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in
@2.

2:6  As ye have @fore received @2 @ the Lord, so walk ye in
him:
2:7  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
been taught, abounding @in with thanksgiving.

2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you @E philosophy and vain deceit,
@ the tradition of men, @ the rudiments of the world, and not @
@2.

2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

2:10  And ye are complete in him, @ is the head of all principality and
power:
2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made @S
@D, in putting off the body of the sins of the @R by the circumcision
of @2:
2:12  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
@E the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
@R, hath he quickened @? with him, having for@= you all
trespasses;
2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was @
 us, @
was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
2:15  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
openly, triumphing over them in it.

2:16  Let no man @fore judge you in meat, or in @b, or in respect of
an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
2:17  Which are a shadow of @ to come; but the body is of @2.

2:18  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
worshipping of angels, intruding into @J @ @ he hath not seen,
vainly puffed up by his @Rly mind,
2:19  And not holding the Head, from @ all the body by joints and bands
having nourishment ministered, and knit @?, increaseth with the
increase of God.

2:20  Wherefore if ye be dead with @2 from the rudiments of the world,
why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
2:21  (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
2:22  Which all are to perish with the using;) @ the commandments and
doctrines of men?
2:23  Which @ have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying
of the @R.

3:1  If ye then be risen with @2, seek @J @ @ are above,
where @2 sitteth on the @c hand of God.

3:2  Set your affection on @ above, not on @ on the @.

3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with @2 in God.

3:4  When @2, who is our life, @ appear, then @ ye also appear
with him in @Y.

3:5  Mortify @fore your members @ are upon the @; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
@ is idolatry:
3:6  For @ @' sake the wrath of God cometh on the @ of
disobedience:
3:7  In the @ ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

3:8  But now ye also put off all @; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
filthy communication out of your @P.

3:9  Lie not one to @F, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
his deeds;
3:10  And have put on the new man, @ is renewed in knowledge @ the
image of him that created him:
3:11  Where @ is @" Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but @2 is all, and in
all.

3:12  Put on @fore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
3:13  Forbearing one @F, and forgiving one @F, if any man have a
quarrel @
 any: even as @2 forgave you, so also do ye.

3:14  And above all @ @ put on charity, @ is the bond of
perfectness.

3:15  And let the @U of God rule in your @s, to the @ also ye

3:16  Let the word of @2 dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
and admonishing one @F in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
with grace in your @s to the Lord.

3:17  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
@, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

3:18  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
Lord.

3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter @
 them.

3:20  Children, obey your parents in all @: for this is well pleasing
unto the Lord.

3:21  Fathers, provoke not your @ to anger, lest they be
discouraged.

3:22  Servants, obey in all @ your masters @$ to the @R; not

3:25  But he that doeth wrong @ receive for the wrong @ he hath

4:1  Masters, give unto your @<s that @ is just and equal; knowing

4:2  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
4:3  Withal praying also for us, that God @L open unto us a door of

4:5  Walk in wisdom toward them that are @S, redeeming the time.

4:6  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may

4:7  All my state @ Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved

The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Thessalonians @ is in God the Father and in the Lord @ @2:
Grace be unto you, and @U, from God our Father, and the Lord @
@2.

1:2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
our prayers; 1:3 Remembering @S ceasing your work of faith, and
labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord @ @2, in the
sight of God and our Father; 1:4 Knowing, @3 beloved, your
election of God.

1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner
of men we were @ you for your sake.

1:6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.

1:7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
Achaia.

1:8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
Macedonia and Achaia, but also in @ @' your faith to God-ward
is spread abroad; so that we need not to @K any @7.

1:9 For they @T shew of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and
true God; 1:10 And to wait for his Son from @1, whom he raised
from the dead, even @, @ delivered us from the wrath to come.

2:1 For yourselves, @3, know our entrance in unto you, that it
was not in vain: 2:2 But even @ that we had suffered @	, and
were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
our God to @K unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
guile: 2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
gospel, even so we @K; not as pleasing men, but God, @ trieth
our @s.

2:5 For @" at any time used we flattering @5, as ye know, nor
a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: 2:6 Nor of men sought we
@Y, @" of you, nor yet of @Cs, when we @B have been
burdensome, as the apostles of @2.

2:7 But we were gentle @ you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
@: 2:8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing
to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our
own souls, @ ye were dear unto us.

2:9 For ye remember, @3, our labour and travail: for labouring
night and day, @ we @L not be chargeable unto any of you, we
preached unto you the gospel of God.

2:10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
unblameably we behaved ourselves @ you that believe: 2:11 As ye
know how we exhorted and comforted and charged @ one of you, as a
@ doth his @, 2:12 That ye @L walk worthy of God, who
hath @, you unto his kingdom and @Y.

2:13 For this cause also thank we God @S ceasing, @, when
ye received the word of God @ ye @) of us, ye received it not
as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, @
effectually worketh also in you that believe.

2:14 For ye, @3, became followers of the churches of God @
in Judaea are in @2 @: for ye also have suffered like @
of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 2:15 Who both
killed the Lord @, and @ own prophets, and have persecuted us;
and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 2:16 Forbidding
us to @K to the Gentiles that they @B be saved, to fill up @
sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

2:17 But we, @3, being taken from you for a short time in
presence, not in @, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your
face with @ desire.

2:18 Wherefore we @L have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
@*; but Satan hindered us.

2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
ye in the presence of our Lord @ @2 at his coming?  2:20 For
ye are our @Y and joy.

3:1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
be left at Athens alone; 3:2 And sent Timotheus, our @X, and
minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of @2, to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 3:3 That no
man @# be moved by @ afflictions: for yourselves know that we
are appointed @unto.

3:4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you @	 that we
@# suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

3:5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our
labour be in vain.

3:6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and @ us good
tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance
of us always, desiring @ly to see us, as we also to see you: 3:7
@N, @3, we were comforted over you in all our affliction
and distress by your faith: 3:8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in
the Lord.

3:9 For what thanks can we render to God @* for you, for all the
joy wherewith we joy for your sakes @	 our God; 3:10 Night and day
praying exceedingly that we @B see your face, and @B perfect
that @ is lacking in your faith?  3:11 Now God @9 and our
Father, and our Lord @ @2, direct our way unto you.

3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
@F, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: 3:13 To the end
he may stablish your @s unblameable in holiness @	 God, even
our Father, at the coming of our Lord @ @2 with all his
saints.

4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, @3, and exhort you by the
Lord @, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please God, so ye @L abound more and more.

4:2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord @.

4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
@# abstain from fornication: 4:4 That @ one of you @# know
how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 4:5 Not in the
lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles @ know not God: 4:6
That no man go beyond and defraud his @X in any matter: @
that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned
you and testified.

4:7 For God hath not @, us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

4:8 He @fore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
also @= unto us his holy Spirit.

4:9 But as touching @Xly love ye need not that I write unto you:
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one @F.

4:10 And indeed ye do it toward all the @3 @ are in all
Macedonia: but we beseech you, @3, that ye increase more and
more; 4:11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
and to work with your own @D, as we @M you; 4:12 That ye may
walk honestly toward them that are @S, and that ye may have lack
of no@7.

4:13 But I @L not have you to be ignorant, @3, concerning
them @ are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as @Cs @ have
no hope.

4:14 For if we believe that @ died and rose @*, even so them
also @ sleep in @ will God @( with him.

4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we @
are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord @ not prevent
them @ are asleep.

4:16 For the Lord @9 @ descend from @1 with a shout, with
the @; of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
@2 @ rise @O: 4:17 Then we @ are alive and remain @
be caught up @? with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air: and so @ we ever be with the Lord.

4:18 Wherefore comfort one @F with @ @5.

5:1 But of the times and the seasons, @3, ye have no need that I
write unto you.

5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night.

5:3 For when they @ say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they @
not escape.

5:4 But ye, @3, are not in darkness, that that day @#
overtake you as a thief.

5:5 Ye are all the @ of light, and the @ of the day: we
are not of the night, nor of darkness.

5:6 @N let us not sleep, as do @Cs; but let us watch and be
sober.

5:7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night.

5:8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of
salvation.

5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
our Lord @ @2, 5:10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or
sleep, we @# live @? with him.

5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves @?, and edify one @F,
even as also ye do.

5:12 And we beseech you, @3, to know them @ labour @
you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 5:13 And to
esteem them very highly in love for @ work's sake. And be at @U
@ yourselves.

5:14 Now we exhort you, @3, warn them that are unruly, comfort
the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

5:15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
that @ is good, both @ yourselves, and to all men.

The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord @ @2: 1:2 Grace
unto you, and @U, from God our Father and the Lord @ @2.

1:3 We are bound to thank God always for you, @3, as it is meet,
@ that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of @
one of you all toward each @C aboundeth; 1:4 So that we ourselves
@Y in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 1:5 Which is a
manifest token of the @ceous judgment of God, that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for @ ye also suffer: 1:6
Seeing it is a @ceous @7 with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you; 1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us,
when the Lord @ @ be revealed from @1 with his @By
angels, 1:8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord @ @2: 1:9 Who
@ be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord, and from the @Y of his power; 1:10 When he @ come to
be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe
(@ our testimony @ you was believed) in that day.

1:11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God @L count
you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness, and the work of faith with power: 1:12 That the name of our
Lord @ @2 may be glorified in you, and ye in him, @$ to
the grace of our God and the Lord @ @2.

2:1 Now we beseech you, @3, by the coming of our Lord @
@2, and by our gathering @? unto him, 2:2 That ye be not
soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, @" by spirit, nor by word,
nor by letter as from us, as that the day of @2 is at hand.

2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day @ not come,
except @ come a falling away @O, and that man of sin be
revealed, the son of perdition; 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth @9
above all that is @, God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing @9 that he is God.

2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you @
@?  2:6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he @B be
revealed in his time.

2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

2:8 And then @ that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord @
consume with the spirit of his @P, and @ destroy with the
b@cness of his coming: 2:9 Even him, whose coming is @ the
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 2:10 And
with all deceivableness of un@ceousness in them that perish;
@ they received not the love of the truth, that they @B be
saved.

2:11 And for this cause God @ send them strong delusion, that they
@# believe a lie: 2:12 That they all @B be damned who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in un@ceousness.

2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, @3
beloved of the Lord, @ God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation @E sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
truth: 2:14 Whereunto he @, you by our gospel, to the obtaining of
the @Y of our Lord @ @2.

2:15 @N, @3, stand fast, and hold the traditions @ ye
have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

2:16 Now our Lord @ @2 @9, and God, even our Father,
@ hath loved us, and hath @= us everlasting consolation and
good hope @E grace, 2:17 Comfort your @s, and stablish you in
@ good word and work.

3:1 Finally, @3, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: 3:2 And that we
may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have
not faith.

3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who @ stablish you, and keep you
from evil.

3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the @ @ we command you.

3:5 And the Lord direct your @s into the love of God, and into the
patient waiting for @2.

3:6 Now we command you, @3, in the name of our Lord @
@2, that ye withdraw yourselves from @ @X that walketh
disorderly, and not @ the tradition @ he received of us.

3:7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly @ you; 3:8 Neither did we eat any man's @d
for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we
@B not be chargeable to any of you: 3:9 Not @ we have not
power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.

3:10 For even when we were with you, this we @M you, that if
any @L not work, @" @# he eat.

3:11 For we hear that @ are some @ walk @ you disorderly,
working not at all, but are busybodies.

3:12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord @
@2, that with quietness they work, and eat @ own @d.

3:13 But ye, @3, be not weary in well doing.

3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

3:15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a @X.

3:16 Now the Lord of @U @9 give you @U always by all means.
The Lord be with you all.

3:17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, @ is the token in
@ epistle: so I write.

3:18 The grace of our Lord @ @2 be with you all. Amen.




The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


1:1 Paul, an apostle of @ @2 by the commandment of God our
Saviour, and Lord @ @2, @ is our hope; 1:2 Unto Timothy,
my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and @U, from God our Father
and @ @2 our Lord.

1:3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
Macedonia, that thou @Best charge some that they teach no @C
doctrine, 1:4 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,
@ minister questions, rather than godly edifying @ is in
faith: so do.

1:5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure @, and
of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: 1:6 From @ some
having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 1:7 Desiring to
be teachers of the law; @[standing @" what they say, nor
whereof they affirm.

1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a @ceous man, but for
the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for
unholy and profane, for murderers of @s and murderers of m@Cs,
for manslayers, 1:10 For whoremongers, for them that defile @T
with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if
@ be any @C @7 that is contrary to sound doctrine; 1:11
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, @ was
committed to my trust.

1:12 And I thank @2 @ our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 1:13 Who was
@	 a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained
mercy, @ I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

1:14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
love @ is in @2 @.

1:15 This is a faithful @, and worthy of all acceptation, that
@2 @ came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

1:16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me @O @
@2 @B shew @ all longsuffering, for a pattern to them @
@# here@ believe on him to life everlasting.

1:17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
God, be honour and @Y for ever and ever. Amen.

1:18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, @$ to the
prophecies @ went @	 on thee, that thou by them @Best war a
good warfare; 1:19 Holding faith, and a good conscience; @ some
having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 1:20 Of whom is
Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they
may learn not to blaspheme.

2:1 I exhort @fore, that, @O of all, supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2:2 For
kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and
@Uable life in all godliness and honesty.

2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
of the truth.

2:5 For @ is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
man @2 @; 2:6 Who gave @9 a ransom for all, to be
testified in due time.

2:7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I @K the
truth in @2, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
verity.

2:8 I will @fore that men pray @ where, lifting up holy @D,
@S wrath and doubting.

2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn @T in modest
apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly array; 2:10 But (@ becometh women
professing godliness) with good works.

2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
the man, but to be in silence.

2:13 For Adam was @O formed, then Eve.

2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
the transgression.

2:15 Notwithstanding she @ be saved in childbearing, if they
continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

3:1 This is a true @, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
desireth a good work.

3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, @= to hospitality, apt to
teach; 3:3 Not @= to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 3:4 One that ruleth well his
own @, having his @ in subjection with all gravity; 3:5
(For if a man know not how to rule his own @, how @ he take
care of the church of God?)  3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them @ are @S;
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not @=
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 3:9 Holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience.

3:10 And let @ also @O be proved; then let them use the office
of a deacon, being @V blameless.

3:11 Even so must @ wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
faithful in all @.

3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling @
@ and @ own @s well.

3:13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
@T a good degree, and @ boldness in the faith @ is in
@2 @.

3:14 These @ write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
3:15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the @ of God, @ is the church of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

3:16 And @S controversy @ is the mystery of godliness: God
was manifest in the @R, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
@Y.

4:1 Now the Spirit @Keth expressly, that in the latter times some
@ depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
doctrines of devils; 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having @
conscience seared with a hot iron; 4:3 Forbidding to marry, and
commanding to abstain from meats, @ God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving of them @ believe and know the truth.

4:4 For @ creature of God is good, and no@7 to be refused, if
it be received with thanksgiving: 4:5 For it is sanctified by the word
of God and prayer.

4:6 If thou put the @3 in remembrance of @ @, thou
@ be a good minister of @ @2, nourished up in the @5 of
faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

4:7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
rather unto godliness.

4:8 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
unto all @, having promise of the life that now is, and of that
@ is to come.

4:9 This is a faithful @ and worthy of all acceptation.

4:10 For @fore we both labour and suffer reproach, @ we
trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of
@J that believe.

4:11 These @ command and teach.

4:12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith,
in purity.

4:13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
doctrine.

4:14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, @ was @= thee by
prophecy, with the laying on of the @D of the presbytery.

4:15 Meditate upon @ @; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
profiting may appear to all.

4:16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:
for in doing this thou @ both save thyself, and them that hear
thee.

5:1 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a @; and the younger
men as @3; 5:2 The elder women as m@Cs; the younger as
sisters, with all purity.

5:3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

5:4 But if any widow have @ or nephews, let them learn @O to
shew piety at home, and to requite @ parents: for that is good and
acceptable @	 God.

5:5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

5:6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

5:7 And @ @ give in charge, that they may be blameless.

5:8 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for @J of his
own @, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

5:9 Let not a widow be taken into the number @[ @@score @8
old, having been the wife of one man.

5:10 Well reported of for good works; if she have @ up @,
if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if
she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed @
good work.

5:11 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
wanton @
 @2, they will marry; 5:12 Having damnation, @
they have cast off @ @O faith.

5:13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering @+ from @ to
@; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, @King
@ @ they ought not.

5:14 I will @fore that the younger women marry, bear @,
guide the @, give none occasion to the adversary to @K
reproachfully.

5:15 For some are already turned aside @ Satan.

5:16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that
are widows indeed.

5:17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

5:18 For the scripture @
, Thou @ not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

5:19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but @	 two or
@@ witnesses.

5:20 Them that sin rebuke @	 all, that @Cs also may fear.

5:21 I charge thee @	 God, and the Lord @ @2, and the
elect angels, that thou observe @ @ @S preferring one
@	 @F, doing no@7 by partiality.

5:22 Lay @D suddenly on no man, @" be partaker of @C men's
sins: keep thyself pure.

5:23 Drink no longer @Z, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
sake and @ often infirmities.

5:24 Some men's sins are open @	hand, going @	 to judgment;
and some men they follow @.

5:25 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest @	hand; and
they that are @Cwise cannot be hid.

6:1 Let as many @<s as are @[ the yoke count @ own masters
worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not
blasphemed.

6:2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
@ they are @3; but rather do them service, @ they
are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These @ teach
and exhort.

6:3 If any man teach @Cwise, and consent not to wholesome @5,
even the @5 of our Lord @ @2, and to the doctrine @ is
@$ to godliness; 6:4 He is proud, knowing no@7, but doting
@+ questions and strifes of @5, whereof cometh envy, strife,
railings, evil surmisings, 6:5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt
minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness:
from such withdraw thyself.

6:6 But godliness with contentment is @ gain.

6:7 For we @ no@7 into this world, and it is certain we can
carry no@7 out.

6:8 And having food and raiment let us be @with content.

6:9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
into many foolish and hurtful lusts, @ drown men in destruction
and perdition.

6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: @ while some
coveted @, they have erred from the faith, and pierced @T
@E with many sorrows.

6:11 But thou, O man of God, flee @ @; and follow @

6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,

6:13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all

6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not

The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


1:1 Paul, an apostle of @ @2 by the will of God, @$ to

my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and @U, from God the Father

1:3 I thank God, whom I serve from my fore@s with pure
conscience, that @S ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
prayers night and day; 1:4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful
of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 1:5 When I call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, @ dwelt @O in
thy grandm@C Lois, and thy m@C Eunice; and I am persuaded that
in thee also.

1:6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of

1:7 For God hath not @= us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.

1:8 Be not thou @fore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
@$ to the power of God; 1:9 Who hath saved us, and @, us

own purpose and grace, @ was @= us in @2 @ @	 the
world began, 1:10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our
Saviour @ @2, who hath abolished @^, and hath @ life

appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

1:12 For the @ cause I also suffer @ @: nevertheless I am
not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he
is able to keep that @ I have committed unto him @
 that day.

1:13 Hold fast the form of sound @5, @ thou hast @) of me,

1:14 That good @7 @ was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
Ghost @ dwelleth in us.

1:15 This thou knowest, that all they @ are in Asia be turned away
from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

1:16 The Lord give mercy unto the @ of Onesiphorus; for he oft
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 1:17 But, when he was
in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and @V me.

1:18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
that day: and in how many @ he ministered unto me at Ephesus,
thou knowest very well.

2:1 Thou @fore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in @2
@.

2:2 And the @ that thou hast @) of me @ many witnesses,
the same commit thou to faithful men, who @ be able to teach
@Cs also.

2:3 Thou @fore endure hardness, as a good soldier of @ @2.

2:4 No man that warreth entangleth @9 with the affairs of this
life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

2:5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
except he strive lawfully.

2:6 The husbandman that laboureth must be @O partaker of the
fruits.

2:7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee @[standing in all
@.

2:8 Remember that @ @2 of the seed of @ was raised from

2:10 @N I endure all @ for the elect's sakes, that they
may also obtain the salvation @ is in @2 @ with eternal

2:11 It is a faithful @: For if we be dead with him, we @
also live with him: 2:12 If we suffer, we @ also reign with him:
if we deny him, he also will deny us: 2:13 If we believe not, yet he
abideth faithful: he cannot deny @9.

2:14 Of @ @ put them in remembrance, charging them @	 the
Lord that they strive not @+ @5 to no profit, but to the
subverting of the hearers.

2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, @cly dividing the word of truth.

2:16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
more ungodliness.

2:17 And @ word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
and Philetus; 2:18 Who concerning the truth have erred, @ that
the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

2:19 Nevertheless the @Vation of God standeth sure, having this
seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let @ one that
nameth the name of @2 depart from iniquity.

2:20 But in a @ @ @ are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of @; and some to honour, and some to
dishonour.

2:21 If a man @fore purge @9 from @, he @ be a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared
unto @ good work.

2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow @ceousness, faith,
charity, @U, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure @.

2:23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes.

2:24 And the @< of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all men, apt to teach, patient, 2:25 In meekness instructing @J

@T out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him
at his will.

3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times @ come.

3:2 For men @ be lovers of @ own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3:3
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of @J that are good, 3:4 Traitors, heady,
highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 3:5 Having a
form of godliness, but denying the power @of: from such turn away.

3:6 For of this sort are they @ creep into @s, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 3:7
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

3:8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood @, so do @ also resist
the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

3:9 But they @ proceed no further: for @ folly @ be

3:10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 3:11 Persecutions,
afflictions, @ came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra;
what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered
me.

3:12 Yea, and all that will live godly in @2 @ @ suffer

3:13 But evil men and seducers @ wax worse and worse, deceiving,

3:14 But continue thou in the @ @ thou hast learned and hast

3:16 All scripture is @= by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
@ceousness: 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, @Ely

4:1 I charge thee @fore @	 God, and the Lord @ @2, who
@ judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but @ @ own lusts @ they heap to @T teachers,
having itching ears; 4:4 And they @ turn away @ ears from the
truth, and @ be turned unto fables.

4:5 But watch thou in all @, endure afflictions, do the work of
an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

4:6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand.

4:7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith: 4:8 Hence@ @ is laid up for me a crown of
@ceousness, @ the Lord, the @ceous judge, @ give me at

4:9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 4:10 For Demas hath

Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

4:11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and @( him with thee: for he

4:16 At my @O answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:
I pray God that it may not be laid to @ charge.

4:17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that

@B hear: and I was delivered out of the @P of the lion.

4:18 And the Lord @ deliver me from @ evil work, and will

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus


1:1 Paul, a @< of God, and an apostle of @ @2, @$
to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth @
is @ godliness; 1:2 In hope of eternal life, @ God, that
cannot lie, promised @	 the world began; 1:3 But hath in due times
manifested his word @E preaching, @ is committed unto me
@$ to the commandment of God our Saviour; 1:4 To Titus, mine
own son @ the common faith: Grace, mercy, and @U, from God the
Father and the Lord @ @2 our Saviour.

1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou @#est set in
order the @ that are wanting, and ordain elders in @ city, as
I had appointed thee: 1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one
wife, having faithful @ not accused of riot or unruly.

1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
selfwilled, not soon angry, not @= to wine, no striker, not @=
to filthy lucre; 1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,
sober, just, holy, temperate; 1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers.

1:10 For @ are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
specially they of the circumcision: 1:11 Whose @Ps must be stopped,
who subvert whole @s, teaching @ @ they ought not, for
filthy lucre's sake.

1:12 One of @T, even a prophet of @ own, said, The
Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith; 1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

1:15 Unto the pure all @ are pure: but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving is no@7 pure; but even @ mind and conscience is
defiled.

1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
being abominable, and disobedient, and unto @ good work reprobate.

2:1 But @K thou the @ @ become sound doctrine: 2:2 That
the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity,
in patience.

2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not @= to much wine, teachers of good
@; 2:4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love
@ husbands, to love @ @, 2:5 To be discreet, chaste,
keepers at home, good, obedient to @ own husbands, that the word
of God be not blasphemed.

2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

2:7 In all @ shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 2:8 Sound speech, that
cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be
ashamed, having no evil @7 to say of you.

2:9 Exhort @<s to be obedient unto @ own masters, and to
please them well in all @; not answering @*; 2:10 Not
purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all @.

2:11 For the grace of God that @(eth salvation hath appeared to all
men, 2:12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
@# live soberly, @ceously, and godly, in this present world;
2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
@ God and our Saviour @ @2; 2:14 Who gave @9 for us,
that he @B redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto @9 a
peculiar @, zealous of good works.

2:15 These @ @K, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
Let no man despise thee.

3:1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
obey magistrates, to be ready to @ good work, 3:2 To @K evil of
no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all
men.

3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
envy, hateful, and hating one @F.

3:4 But @ that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared, 3:5 Not by works of @ceousness @ we have done, but
@$ to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 3:6 Which he shed on us abundantly
@E @ @2 our Saviour; 3:7 That being justified by his
grace, we @# be made heirs @$ to the hope of eternal life.

3:8 This is a faithful @, and @ @ I will that thou
affirm constantly, that they @ have believed in God @B be
careful to maintain good works. These @ are good and profitable
unto men.

3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
strivings @+ the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

3:10 A man that is an heretick @ the @O and second admonition
reject; 3:11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth,
being condemned of @9.

3:12 When I @ send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to
come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined @ to winter.

3:13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on @ journey diligently,
that no@7 be wanting unto them.

3:14 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses, that they be not unfruitful.

3:15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon


1:1 Paul, a prisoner of @ @2, and Timothy our @X, unto
Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 1:2 And to our
beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in
thy @: 1:3 Grace to you, and @U, from God our Father and the
Lord @ @2.

1:4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 1:5
Hearing of thy love and faith, @ thou hast toward the Lord @,
and toward all saints; 1:6 That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of @ good @7 @ is in
you in @2 @.

1:7 For we have @ joy and consolation in thy love, @ the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, @X.

1:8 Wherefore, though I @B be much bold in @2 to enjoin thee
that @ is convenient, 1:9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech
thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of
@ @2.

1:10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds: 1:11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
profitable to thee and to me: 1:12 Whom I have sent @*: thou
@fore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 1:13 Whom I @L
have retained with me, that in thy stead he @B have ministered unto
me in the bonds of the gospel: 1:14 But @S thy mind @L I do
no@7; that thy benefit @# not be as it were of necessity, but
willingly.

1:15 For perhaps he @fore departed for a season, that thou
@#est receive him for ever; 1:16 Not now as a @<, but above a
@<, a @X beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the @R, and in the Lord?  1:17 If thou count me
@fore a partner, receive him as myself.

1:18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
account; 1:19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay
it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even @ own
self besides.

1:20 Yea, @X, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
bowels in the Lord.

1:21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt also do more than I say.

1:22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that @E
your prayers I @ be @= unto you.

1:23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in @2 @;
1:24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

1:25 The grace of our Lord @ @2 be with your spirit. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews


1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners @0 in time past
unto the @s by the prophets, 1:2 Hath in @ last days spoken
unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all @, by whom
also he made the worlds; 1:3 Who being the b@cness of his @Y,
and the express image of his person, and upholding all @ by the
word of his power, when he had by @9 purged our sins, sat down on
the @c hand of the Majesty on high: 1:4 Being made so much better
than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name than they.

1:5 For unto @ of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee? And @*, I will be to him a Father,
and he @ be to me a Son?  1:6 And @*, when he @(eth in the
@Obegotten into the world, he @
, And let all the angels of God
worship him.

1:7 And of the angels he @
, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
ministers a flame of fire.

1:8 But unto the Son he @
, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever: a sceptre of @ceousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

1:9 Thou hast loved @ceousness, and hated iniquity; @fore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

1:10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the @Vation of the
@; and the @1s are the works of @ @D: 1:11 They @
perish; but thou remainest; and they all @ wax old as doth a
garment; 1:12 And as a vesture @ thou fold them up, and they @
be changed: but thou art the same, and thy @8 @ not fail.

1:13 But to @ of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my @c
hand, until I make @ enemies thy footstool?  1:14 Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent @ to minister for them who @ be
heirs of salvation?  2:1 @N we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the @ @ we have @), lest at any time we @# let
them slip.

2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and @
transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
2:3 How @ we escape, if we neglect so @ salvation; @ at
the @O began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
them that @) him; 2:4 God also bearing them witness, both with
signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Ghost, @$ to his own will?  2:5 For unto the angels hath he not
put in subjection the world to come, whereof we @K.

2:6 But one in a certain @' testified, @, What is man, that
thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
2:7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
with @Y and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy @D:
2:8 Thou hast put all @ in subjection @[ his feet. For in that
he put all in subjection @[ him, he left no@7 that is not put
@[ him.

But now we see not yet all @ put @[ him.

2:9 But we see @, who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of @^, crowned with @Y and honour; that he by the
grace of God @# taste @^ for @ man.

2:10 For it became him, for whom are all @, and by whom are all
@, in @(ing many sons unto @Y, to make the captain of @
salvation perfect @E sufferings.

2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one: for @ cause he is not ashamed to call them @3, 2:12
Saying, I will declare thy name unto my @3, in the @a of the
church will I sing praise unto thee.

2:13 And @*, I will put my trust in him. And @*, @. I and
the @ @ God hath @= me.

2:14 Forasmuch then as the @ are partakers of @R and @I,
he also @9 likewise took part of the same; that @E @^ he
@B destroy him that had the power of @^, that is, the devil;
2:15 And deliver them who @E fear of @^ were all @
lifetime subject to bondage.

2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took
on him the seed of Abraham.

2:17 Wherefore in all @ it behoved him to be made like unto his
@3, that he @B be a merciful and faithful high @6 in
@ pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
@.

2:18 For in that he @9 hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
succour them that are tempted.

3:1 Wherefore, holy @3, partakers of the @1ly calling,
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, @2 @;
3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also @ was
faithful in all his @.

3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more @Y than @, inasmuch
as he who hath builded the @ hath more honour than the @.

3:4 For @ @ is builded by some man; but he that built all
@ is God.

3:5 And @ verily was faithful in all his @, as a @<, for
a testimony of @J @ @ were to be spoken @; 3:6 But
@2 as a son over his own @; whose @ are we, if we hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost @
, To day if ye will hear his
@;, 3:8 Harden not your @s, as in the provocation, in the day
of temptation in the wilderness: 3:9 When your @s tempted me,
proved me, and saw my works forty @8.

3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
alway err in @ @; and they have not known my ways.

3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They @ not enter into my rest.)  3:12
Take heed, @3, lest @ be in any of you an evil @ of
unbelief, in departing from the living God.

3:13 But exhort one @F daily, while it is @, To day; lest any
of you be hardened @E the deceitfulness of sin.

3:14 For we are made partakers of @2, if we hold the beginning of
our confidence stedfast unto the end; 3:15 While it is said, To day if
ye will hear his @;, harden not your @s, as in the provocation.

3:16 For some, when they had @), did provoke: howbeit not all that
came out of @- by @.

3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty @8? was it not with them
that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  3:18 And to
whom sware he that they @# not enter into his rest, but to them
that believed not?  3:19 So we see that they could not enter in
@ of unbelief.

4:1 Let us @fore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering
into his rest, any of you @# seem to come short of it.

4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the
word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them
that @) it.

4:3 For we @ have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, if they @ enter into my rest: although the
works were finished from the @Vation of the world.

4:4 For he @0 in a certain @' of the @Hth day on this wise,
And God did rest the @Hth day from all his works.

4:5 And in this @' @*, If they @ enter into my rest.

4:6 Seeing @fore it remaineth that some must enter @in, and
they to whom it was @O preached entered not in @ of unbelief:
4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, @ in @, To day, @
so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his @;,
harden not your @s.

4:8 For if @ had @= them rest, then @L he not @ward have
spoken of @F day.

4:9 There remaineth @fore a rest to the @ of God.

4:10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
his own works, as God did from his.

4:11 Let us labour @fore to enter into that rest, lest any man
fall @ the same example of unbelief.

4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
twoedged @Q, piercing even to the dividing as@[ of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the @.

4:13 Neither is @ any creature that is not manifest in his sight:
but all @ are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
have to do.

4:14 Seeing then that we have a @ high @6, that is passed into
the @1s, @ the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

4:15 For we have not an high @6 @ cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
are, yet @S sin.

4:16 Let us @fore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

5:1 For @ high @6 taken from @ men is ordained for men in
@ pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins: 5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them
that are out of the way; for that he @9 also is compassed with
infirmity.

5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the @, so also for
@9, to offer for sins.

5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto @9, but he that is @,
of God, as was Aaron.

5:5 So also @2 glorified not @9 to be made an high @6;
but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten
thee.

5:6 As he @
 also in @F @', Thou art a @6 for ever
@ the order of Melchisedec.

5:7 Who in the days of his @R, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
save him from @^, and was @) in that he feared; 5:8 Though he
were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the @ @ he suffered;
5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him; 5:10 Called of God an high @6 @
the order of Melchisedec.

5:11 Of whom we have many @ to say, and hard to be uttered,
seeing ye are dull of hearing.

5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
one teach you @* @ be the @O principles of the oracles of
God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

5:13 For @ one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
@ceousness: for he is a babe.

5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
@J who by reason of use have @ senses exercised to discern both
good and evil.

6:1 @N leaving the principles of the doctrine of @2, let us
go on unto perfection; not laying @* the @Vation of repentance
from dead works, and of faith toward God, 6:2 Of the doctrine of
baptisms, and of laying on of @D, and of resurrection of the dead,
and of eternal judgment.

6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.

6:4 For it is impossible for @J who were once enlightened, and have
tasted of the @1ly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost, 6:5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come, 6:6 If they @ fall away, to renew them @* unto
repentance; seeing they crucify to @T the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame.

6:7 For the @ @ @beth in the rain that cometh oft upon it,
and @(eth @ herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,
receiveth blessing from God: 6:8 But that @ beareth thorns and
briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be
burned.

6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better @ of you, and @
that accompany salvation, though we thus @K.

6:10 For God is not un@ceous to forget your work and labour of
love, @ ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered
to the saints, and do minister.

6:11 And we desire that @ one of you do shew the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end: 6:12 That ye be not slothful,
but followers of them who @E faith and patience inherit the
promises.

6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, @ he could swear by
no @er, he sware by @9, 6:14 Saying, Surely blessing I will
bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

6:15 And so, @ he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

6:16 For men verily swear by the @er: and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife.

6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 6:18
That by two immutable @, in @ it was impossible for God to
lie, we @B have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to
lay hold upon the hope set @	 us: 6:19 Which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and @ entereth into
that within the veil; 6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered,
even @, made an high @6 for ever @ the order of
Melchisedec.

7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, @6 of the most high God,
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed
him; 7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; @O being by
interpretation King of @ceousness, and @ that also King of
Salem, @ is, King of @U; 7:3 Without @, @S m@C,
@S descent, having @" beginning of days, nor end of life;
but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a @6 continually.

7:4 Now consider how @ this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
office of the @6hood, have a commandment to take tithes of the
@ @$ to the law, that is, of @ @3, though they
come out of the loins of Abraham: 7:6 But he whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had
the promises.

7:7 And @S all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but @ he receiveth them,
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
in Abraham.

7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his @, when Melchisedec met
him.

7:11 If @fore perfection were by the Levitical @6hood, (for
@[ it the @ received the law,) what further need was @
that @F @6 @# rise @ the order of Melchisedec, and
not be @, @ the order of Aaron?  7:12 For the @6hood being
changed, @ is made of necessity a change also of the law.

7:13 For he of whom @ @ are spoken pertaineth to @F
tribe, of @ no man gave attendance at the @\.

7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of @
tribe @ @0 no@7 concerning @6hood.

7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that @ the similitude of
Melchisedec @ ariseth @F @6, 7:16 Who is made, not @
the law of a carnal commandment, but @ the power of an endless
life.

7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a @6 for ever @ the order of
Melchisedec.

7:18 For @ is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
@	 for the weakness and unprofitableness @of.

7:19 For the law made no@7 perfect, but the @(ing in of a better
hope did; by the @ we draw nigh unto God.

7:20 And inasmuch as not @S an oath he was made @6: 7:21 (For
@J @6s were made @S an oath; but this with an oath by him
that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a
@6 for ever @ the order of Melchisedec:) 7:22 By so much was
@ made a surety of a better testament.

7:23 And they truly were many @6s, @ they were not suffered
to continue by reason of @^: 7:24 But this man, @ he
continueth ever, hath an unchangeable @6hood.

7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

7:26 For such an high @6 became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the @1s;
7:27 Who needeth not daily, as @J high @6s, to offer up
sacrifice, @O for his own sins, and then for the @'s: for this
he did once, when he offered up @9.

7:28 For the law maketh men high @6s @ have infirmity; but the
word of the oath, @ was since the law, maketh the Son, who is
consecrated for evermore.

8:1 Now of the @ @ we have spoken this is the sum: We have
such an high @6, who is set on the @c hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the @1s; 8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the
true tabernacle, @ the Lord pitched, and not man.

8:3 For @ high @6 is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to
offer.

8:4 For if he were on @, he @# not be a @6, seeing that
@ are @6s that offer gifts @$ to the law: 8:5 Who serve
unto the example and shadow of @1ly @, as @ was
admonished of God when he was @+ to make the tabernacle: for, See,
@
 he, that thou make all @ @$ to the pattern shewed to
thee in the mount.

8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant, @ was established
upon better promises.

8:7 For if that @O covenant had been faultless, then @# no
@' have been sought for the second.

8:8 For finding fault with them, he @
, @., the days come,
@
 the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the @ of
@ and with the @ of @: 8:9 Not @$ to the covenant
that I made with @ @s in the day when I took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of @-; @ they continued not in
my covenant, and I regarded them not, @
 the Lord.

8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the @ of
@ @ @J days, @
 the Lord; I will put my laws into @
mind, and write them in @ @s: and I will be to them a God, and
they @ be to me a @: 8:11 And they @ not teach @ man
his neighbour, and @ man his @X, @, Know the Lord: for
all @ know me, from the least to the @est.

8:12 For I will be merciful to @ un@ceousness, and @ sins
and @ iniquities will I remember no more.

8:13 In that he @
, A new covenant, he hath made the @O old. Now
that @ decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

9:1 Then verily the @O covenant had also ordinances of divine
service, and a worldly sanctuary.

9:2 For @ was a tabernacle made; the @O, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the shew@d; @ is @, the
sanctuary.

9:3 And @ the second veil, the tabernacle @ is @, the
Holiest of all; 9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the
covenant overlaid round @+ with gold, wherein was the golden pot
that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
covenant; 9:5 And over it the cherubims of @Y shadowing the
mercyseat; of @ we cannot now @K particularly.

9:6 Now when @ @ were thus ordained, the @6s went always
into the @O tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.

9:7 But into the second went the high @6 alone once @ year,
not @S @I, @ he offered for @9, and for the errors of
the @: 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the
holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the @O
tabernacle was yet standing: 9:9 Which was a figure for the time then
present, in @ were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could
not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the
conscience; 9:10 Which stood only in meats and @bs, and divers
washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
reformation.

9:11 But @2 being come an high @6 of good @ to come, by a
@er and more perfect tabernacle, not made with @D, that is to
say, not of this building; 9:12 Neither by the @I of goats and
calves, but by his own @I he entered in once into the holy @',
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

9:13 For if the @I of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
@R: 9:14 How much more @ the @I of @2, who @E the
eternal Spirit offered @9 @S spot to God, purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  9:15 And for this
cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of @^,
for the redemption of the transgressions that were @[ the @O
testament, they @ are @, @B receive the promise of eternal
inheritance.

9:16 For where a testament is, @ must also of necessity be the
@^ of the testator.

9:17 For a testament is of force @ men are dead: @Cwise it is
of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

9:18 Whereupon @" the @O testament was dedicated @S
@I.

9:19 For when @ had spoken @ precept to all the @
@$ to the law, he took the @I of calves and of goats, with
@Z, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and
all the @, 9:20 Saying, This is the @I of the testament @
God hath enjoined unto you.

9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with @I both the tabernacle, and all the
vessels of the ministry.

9:22 And almost all @ are by the law purged with @I; and
@S shedding of @I is no remission.

9:23 It was @fore necessary that the patterns of @ in the
@1s @# be purified with @; but the @1ly @
@T with better sacrifices than @.

9:24 For @2 is not entered into the holy @'s made with @D,
@ are the figures of the true; but into @1 itself, now to
appear in the presence of God for us: 9:25 Nor yet that he @#
offer @9 often, as the high @6 entereth into the holy @'
@ year with @I of @Cs; 9:26 For then must he often have
suffered since the @Vation of the world: but now once in the end of
the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
@9.

9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but @ this the
judgment: 9:28 So @2 was once offered to bear the sins of many;
and unto them that look for him @ he appear the second time
@S sin unto salvation.

10:1 For the law having a shadow of good @ to come, and not the
very image of the @, can never with @J sacrifices @ they
offered year by year continually make the comers @unto perfect.

10:2 For then @L they not have ceased to be offered? @ that
the worshippers once purged @# have had no more conscience of
sins.

10:3 But in @J sacrifices @ is a remembrance @* made of sins
@ year.

10:4 For it is not possible that the @I of bulls and of goats
@# take away sins.

10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he @
, Sacrifice and
@& thou @Lest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 10:6 In
@_ @&s and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
of me,) to do thy will, O God.

10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and @& and @_ @&s
and @& for sin thou @Lest not, @" hadst pleasure
@in; @ are offered by the law; 10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come
to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the @O, that he may establish
the second.

10:10 By the @ will we are sanctified @E the @& of the
body of @ @2 once for all.

10:11 And @ @6 standeth daily ministering and @&
oftentimes the same sacrifices, @ can never take away sins: 10:12
But this man, @ he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,
sat down on the @c hand of God; 10:13 From hence@ expecting
till his enemies be made his footstool.

10:14 For by one @& he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified.

10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for @ that
he had said @	, 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with
them @ @J days, @
 the Lord, I will put my laws into @
@s, and in @ minds will I write them; 10:17 And @ sins and
iniquities will I remember no more.

10:18 Now where remission of @ is, @ is no more @& for
sin.

10:19 Having @fore, @3, boldness to enter into the holiest
by the @I of @, 10:20 By a new and living way, @ he hath
consecrated for us, @E the veil, that is to say, his @R; 10:21
And having an high @6 over the @ of God; 10:22 Let us draw
near with a true @ in full assurance of faith, having our @s
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
@Z.

10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith @S wavering;
(for he is faithful that promised;) 10:24 And let us consider one
@F to provoke unto love and to good works: 10:25 Not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves @?, as the manner of some is; but
exhorting one @F: and so much the more, as ye see the day
approaching.

10:26 For if we sin wilfully @ that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, @ remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 10:27 But a
certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, @
@ devour the adversaries.

10:28 He that despised @' law died @S mercy @[ two or
@@ witnesses: 10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, @
he be thought worthy, who hath trodden @[ foot the Son of God, and
hath counted the @I of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified,
an unholy @7, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
will recompense, @
 the Lord. And @*, The Lord @ judge his
@.

10:31 It is a fearful @7 to fall into the @D of the living God.

10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in @, @ ye were
illuminated, ye endured a @ fight of afflictions; 10:33 Partly,
whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions;
and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.

10:34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in @1 a
better and an enduring substance.

10:35 Cast not away @fore your confidence, @ hath @
recompence of reward.

10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, @ ye have done the will
of God, ye @B receive the promise.

10:37 For yet a little while, and he that @ come will come, and
will not tarry.

10:38 Now the just @ live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
soul @ have no pleasure in him.

10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
that believe to the saving of the soul.

11:1 Now faith is the substance of @ hoped for, the evidence of
@ not seen.

11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

11:3 Through faith we @[stand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that @ @ are seen were not made of @
@ do appear.

11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain, by @ he obtained witness that he was @ceous, God
testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet @Keth.

11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he @# not see @^; and
was not @V, @ God had translated him: for @	 his
translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

11:6 But @S faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him.

11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of @ not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his @; by the
@ he condemned the world, and became heir of the @ceousness
@ is by faith.

11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was @, to go out into a @' @
he @# @ receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,
not knowing whither he went.

11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and @], the heirs with
him of the same promise: 11:10 For he looked for a city @ hath
@Vations, whose builder and maker is God.

11:11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, @ she
judged him faithful who had promised.

11:12 @N sprang @ even of one, and him as good as dead, so
many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand @ is by
the sea shore innumerable.

11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
@.

11:14 For they that say such @ declare plainly that they seek a
country.

11:15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence
they came out, they @B have had opportunity to have returned.

11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an @1ly:
wherefore God is not ashamed to be @, @ God: for he hath
prepared for them a city.

11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 11:18
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac @ thy seed be @,: 11:19
Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from
whence also he received him in a figure.

11:20 By faith Isaac blessed @] and Esau concerning @ to come.

11:21 By faith @], when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of
the @ of @; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

11:23 By faith @, when he was born, was hid @@ months of his
parents, @ they saw he was a proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king's commandment.

11:24 By faith @, when he was come to @8, refused to be @,
the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 11:25 Choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the @ of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season; 11:26 Esteeming the reproach of @2 @er riches
than the treasures in @-: for he had respect unto the recompence of
the reward.

11:27 By faith he forsook @-, not fearing the wrath of the king:
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

11:28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of @I,
lest he that destroyed the @Oborn @# touch them.

11:29 By faith they passed @E the Red sea as by dry land: @
the @-ians as@ to do were drowned.

11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, @ they were
compassed @+ @H days.

11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
not, when she had received the spies with @U.

11:32 And what @ I more say? for the time @L fail me to tell of
Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of @ also,
and Samuel, and of the prophets: 11:33 Who @E faith subdued
kingdoms, wrought @ceousness, obtained promises, stopped the @Ps
of lions.

11:34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the @Q,
out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the aliens.

11:35 Women received @ dead raised to life @*: and @Cs were
tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they @B obtain a better
resurrection: 11:36 And @Cs had trial of cruel mockings and
scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 11:37 They were
stoned, they were sawn as@[, were tempted, were slain with the
@Q: they wandered @+ in sheepskins and goatskins; being
destitute, afflicted, tormented; 11:38 (Of whom the world was not
worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and
caves of the @.

11:39 And @ all, having obtained a good report @E faith,
received not the promise: 11:40 God having provided some better @7
for us, that they @S us @# not be made perfect.

12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed @+ with so @ a
cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside @ weight, and the sin @
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is
set @	 us, 12:2 Looking unto @ the author and finisher of our
faith; who for the joy that was set @	 him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the @c hand of the throne
of God.

12:3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
@
 @9, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto @I, striving @
 sin.

12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation @ @Keth unto you as
unto @, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 12:6 For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth @ son whom he receiveth.

12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
what son is he whom the @ chasteneth not?  12:8 But if ye be
@S chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,
and not sons.

12:9 Furthermore we have had @s of our @R @ corrected us,
and we gave them reverence: @ we not much rather be in subjection
unto the Father of spirits, and live?  12:10 For they verily for a few
days chastened us @ @ own pleasure; but he for our profit,
that we @B be partakers of his holiness.

12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless @ward it yieldeth the @Uable fruit of
@ceousness unto them @ are exercised @by.

12:12 Wherefore lift up the @D @ hang down, and the feeble
knees; 12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that @ is
lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

12:14 Follow @U with all men, and holiness, @S @ no man
@ see the Lord: 12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the
grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you,
and @by many be defiled; 12:16 Lest @ be any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his
birth@c.

12:17 For ye know how that @ward, when he @L have inherited the
blessing, he was rejected: for he @V no @' of repentance, though
he sought it carefully with tears.

12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that @B be touched, and
that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the @; of @5; @ @;
they that @) intreated that the word @# not be spoken to them
any more: 12:20 (For they could not endure that @ was @M,
And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it @ be stoned, or
thrust @E with a dart: 12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that
@ said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) 12:22 But ye are come unto
mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the @1ly
@ , and to an innumerable company of angels, 12:23 To the
general assembly and church of the @Oborn, @ are written in
@1, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men
made perfect, 12:24 And to @ the mediator of the new covenant, and
to the @I of sprinkling, that @Keth better @ than that of
Abel.

12:25 See that ye refuse not him that @Keth. For if they escaped
not who refused him that @0 on @, much more @ not we
escape, if we turn away from him that @Keth from @1: 12:26
Whose @; then shook the @: but now he hath promised, @,
Yet once more I shake not the @ only, but also @1.

12:27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of @J
@ that are shaken, as of @ that are made, that @J @
@ cannot be shaken may remain.

12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom @ cannot be moved, let us
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear: 12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.

13:1 Let @Xly love continue.

13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for @by some have
entertained angels unawares.

13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
@ suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

13:5 Let your conversation be @S covetousness; and be content
with such @ as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee.

13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
fear what man @ do unto me.

13:7 Remember them @ have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of @
conversation.

13:8 @ @2 the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

13:9 Be not carried @+ with divers and strange doctrines. For it is
a good @7 that the @ be established with grace; not with meats,
@ have not profited them that have been occupied @in.

13:10 We have an @\, whereof they have no @c to eat @ serve
the tabernacle.

13:11 For the bodies of @J beasts, whose @I is @ into the
sanctuary by the high @6 for sin, are burned @S the camp.

13:12 Wherefore @ also, that he @B sanctify the @ with his
own @I, suffered @S the gate.

13:13 Let us go @ @fore unto him @S the camp, bearing his
reproach.

13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

13:15 By him @fore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.

13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that
they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable
for you.

13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
@ willing to live honestly.

13:19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
to you the sooner.

13:20 Now the God of @U, that @ @* from the dead our Lord
@, that @ shepherd of the sheep, @E the @I of the
everlasting covenant, 13:21 Make you perfect in @ good work to do
his will, working in you that @ is wellpleasing in his sight,
@E @ @2; to whom be @Y for ever and ever. Amen.

13:22 And I beseech you, @3, suffer the word of exhortation: for
I have written a letter unto you in few @5.

13:23 Know ye that our @X Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
if he come shortly, I will see you.

13:24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.

They of Italy salute you.

13:25 Grace be with you all. Amen.




The General Epistle of James


1:1 James, a @< of God and of the Lord @ @2,
to the twelve tribes @ are scattered abroad, greeting.

1:2 My @3, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations; 1:3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
patience.

1:4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting no@7.

1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it @ be @= him.

1:6 But let him ask in faith, no@7 wavering. For he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

1:7 For let not that man think that he @ receive any @7 of the
Lord.

1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

1:9 Let the @X of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10
But the rich, in that he is made low: @ as the flower of the
grass he @ pass away.

1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
wi@th the grass, and the flower @of falleth, and the grace of
the fashion of it perisheth: so also @ the rich man fade away in
his ways.

1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
tried, he @ receive the crown of life, @ the Lord hath
promised to them that love him.

1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
cannot be tempted with evil, @" tempteth he any man: 1:14 But
@ man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
enticed.

1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it @(eth @ sin: and sin,
when it is finished, @(eth @ @^.

1:16 Do not err, my beloved @3.

1:17 Every good gift and @ perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, @"
shadow of turning.

1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
@# be a kind of @Ofruits of his creatures.

1:19 Wherefore, my beloved @3, let @ man be swift to hear,
slow to @K, slow to wrath: 1:20 For the wrath of man worketh not
the @ceousness of God.

1:21 Wherefore lay apart all fil@ss and superfluity of
naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, @ is
able to save your souls.

1:22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves.

1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man @%ing his natural face in a glass: 1:24 For he
@%eth @9, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he was.

1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
@in, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
man @ be blessed in his deed.

1:26 If any man @ you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
tongue, but deceiveth his own @, this man's religion is vain.

1:27 Pure religion and undefiled @	 God and the Father is this, To
visit the @less and widows in @ affliction, and to keep
@9 unspotted from the world.

2:1 My @3, have not the faith of our Lord @ @2, the Lord
of @Y, with respect of persons.

2:2 For if @ come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
goodly apparel, and @ come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 2:3
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clo@7, and say unto
him, Sit thou here in a good @'; and say to the poor, Stand thou
@, or sit here @[ my footstool: 2:4 Are ye not then partial in
yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?  2:5 Hearken, my
beloved @3, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in
faith, and heirs of the kingdom @ he hath promised to them that
love him?  2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress
you, and draw you @	 the judgment seats?  2:7 Do not they
blaspheme that worthy name by the @ ye are @,?  2:8 If ye
fulfil the royal law @$ to the scripture, Thou @ love thy
neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 2:9 But if ye have respect to
persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

2:10 For whosoever @ keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.

2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
transgressor of the law.

2:12 So @K ye, and so do, as they that @ be judged by the law
of liberty.

2:13 For he @ have judgment @S mercy, that hath shewed no
mercy; and mercy rejoiceth @
 judgment.

2:14 What doth it profit, my @3, though a man say he hath faith,
and have not works? can faith save him?  2:15 If a @X or sister
be naked, and destitute of daily food, 2:16 And one of you say unto
them, Depart in @U, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye
give them not @J @ @ are needful to the body; what doth it
profit?  2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
alone.

2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
thy faith @S thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my
works.

2:19 Thou believest that @ is one God; thou doest well: the devils
also believe, and tremble.

2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith @S works is dead?
2:21 Was not Abraham our @ justified by works, when he had
offered Isaac his son upon the @\?  2:22 Seest thou how faith
wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  2:23 And
the scripture was fulfilled @ @
, Abraham believed God, and it
was imputed unto him for @ceousness: and he was @, the Friend
of God.

2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
faith only.

2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
she had received the messengers, and had sent them out @F way?
2:26 For as the body @S the spirit is dead, so faith @S
works is dead also.

3:1 My @3, be not many masters, knowing that we @ receive
the @er condemnation.

3:2 For in many @ we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

3:3 @., we put bits in the horses' @Ps, that they may obey us;
and we turn @+ @ whole body.

3:4 @. also the ships, @ though they be so @, and are
driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned @+ with a very small
helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth @ @.

@., how @ a matter a little fire kindleth!  3:6 And the tongue
is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue @ our members,
that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of
nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

3:7 For @ kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
@ in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 3:8 But
the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
poison.

3:9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and @with curse we
men, @ are made @ the similitude of God.

3:10 Out of the same @P proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
@3, @ @ ought not so to be.

3:11 Doth a fountain send @ at the same @' sweet @Z and
bitter?  3:12 Can the fig tree, my @3, bear olive berries?
either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt @Z and
fresh.

3:13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge @ you? let him
shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

3:14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your @s, @Y
not, and lie not @
 the truth.

3:15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is @ly, sensual,
devilish.

3:16 For where envying and strife is, @ is confusion and @
evil work.

3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is @O pure, then @Uable,
gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
@S partiality, and @S hypocrisy.

3:18 And the fruit of @ceousness is sown in @U of them that make
@U.

4:1 From whence come wars and fightings @ you? come they not
hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?  4:2 Ye lust, and
have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and
war, yet ye have not, @ ye ask not.

4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, @ ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
it upon your lusts.

4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with God? whosoever @fore will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of God.

4:5 Do ye think that the scripture @
 in vain, The spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?  4:6 But he giveth more grace.
Wherefore he @
, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the
humble.

4:7 Submit yourselves @fore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
flee from you.

4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
@D, ye sinners; and purify your @s, ye double minded.

4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he @ lift you
up.

4:11 Speak not evil one of @F, @3. He that @Keth evil of
his @X, and judgeth his @X, @Keth evil of the law, and
judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the
law, but a judge.

4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
art thou that judgest @F?  4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or
to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue @ a year, and
buy and sell, and get gain: 4:14 Whereas ye know not what @ be on
the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth
for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we @ live, and do
this, or that.

4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

4:17 @N to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
him it is sin.

5:1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that @
come upon you.

5:2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

5:3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them @ be a
witness @
 you, and @ eat your @R as it were fire. Ye have
heaped treasure @? for the last days.

5:4 @., the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
fields, @ is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of
them @ have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth.

5:5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the @, and been wanton; ye have
nourished your @s, as in a day of slaughter.

5:6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

5:7 Be patient @fore, @3, unto the coming of the Lord.

@., the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the @,
and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter
rain.

5:8 Be ye also patient; stablish your @s: for the coming of the
Lord draweth nigh.

5:9 Grudge not one @
 @F, @3, lest ye be condemned:
@%, the judge standeth @	 the door.

5:10 Take, my @3, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

5:11 @., we count them happy @ endure. Ye have @) of the
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

5:12 But above all @, my @3, swear not, @" by @1,
@" by the @, @" by any @C oath: but let your yea be
yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

5:13 Is any @ you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him
sing psalms.

5:14 Is any sick @ you? let him call for the elders of the church;
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord: 5:15 And the prayer of faith @ save the sick, and the Lord
@ raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they @ be

5:16 Confess your faults one to @F, and pray one for @F,
that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a @ceous man

5:17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed

5:18 And he prayed @*, and the @1 gave rain, and the @

5:19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert

The First Epistle General of Peter


1:1 Peter, an apostle of @ @2, to the strangers scattered
@Eout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 1:2 Elect
@$ to the foreknowledge of God the Father, @E
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
@I of @ @2: Grace unto you, and @U, be multiplied.

1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord @ @2, @
@$ to his abundant mercy hath begotten us @* unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of @ @2 from the dead, 1:4 To an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
reserved in @1 for you, 1:5 Who are kept by the power of God
@E faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

1:6 Wherein ye @ly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
ye are in heaviness @E manifold temptations: 1:7 That the trial
of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
though it be tried with fire, @B be @V unto praise and honour
and @Y at the appearing of @ @2: 1:8 Whom having not seen,
ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice
with joy un@Kable and full of @Y: 1:9 Receiving the end of your
faith, even the salvation of your souls.

1:10 Of @ salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that @# come unto you:
1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of @2 @
was in them did signify, when it testified @	hand the sufferings
of @2, and the @Y that @# follow.

1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto @T, but unto us
they did minister the @, @ are now reported unto you by them
that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
from @1; @ @ the angels desire to look into.

1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
the end for the grace that is to be @ unto you at the revelation
of @ @2; 1:14 As obedient @, not fashioning yourselves
@$ to the former lusts in your ignorance: 1:15 But as he @
hath @, you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who @S respect of persons
judgeth @$ to @ man's work, pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear: 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible @, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your @s; 1:19 But with
the precious @I of @2, as of a lamb @S blemish and @S
spot: 1:20 Who verily was foreordained @	 the @Vation of the
world, but was manifest in @ last times for you, 1:21 Who by him
do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him
@Y; that your faith and hope @B be in God.

1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth @E
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the @3, see that ye love one
@F with a pure @ fervently: 1:23 Being born @*, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, @
liveth and abideth for ever.

1:24 For all @R is as grass, and all the @Y of man as the flower
of grass. The grass wi@th, and the flower @of falleth away:
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
@ by the gospel is preached unto you.

2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, all evil @Kings, 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow @by: 2:3 If so be ye
have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but chosen of God, and precious, 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are
built up a spiritual @, an holy @6hood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by @ @2.

2:6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, @., I lay in
Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on
him @ not be con@Ved.

2:7 Unto you @fore @ believe he is precious: but unto them
@ be disobedient, the stone @ the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner, 2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and
a rock of offence, even to them @ stumble at the word, being
disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal @6hood, an holy
nation, a peculiar @; that ye @# shew @ the praises of
him who hath @, you out of darkness into his marvellous light;
2:10 Which in time past were not a @, but are now the @ of
God: @ had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
from @Rly lusts, @ war @
 the soul; 2:12 Having your
conversation honest @ the Gentiles: that, whereas they @K
@
 you as evildoers, they may by your good works, @ they
@ @%, glorify God in the day of visitation.

2:13 Submit yourselves to @ ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:
whether it be to the king, as supreme; 2:14 Or unto governors, as unto
them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the
praise of them that do well.

2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men: 2:16 As free, and not using your
liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the @<s of God.

2:17 Honour all men. Love the @Xhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to
the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

2:20 For what @Y is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
@ take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,
ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

2:21 For even hereunto were ye @,: @ @2 also suffered
for us, leaving us an example, that ye @# follow his steps: 2:22
Who did no sin, @" was guile @V in his @P: 2:23 Who, when
he was reviled, reviled not @*; when he suffered, he threatened
not; but committed @9 to him that judgeth @ceously: 2:24 Who
his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
dead to sins, @# live unto @ceousness: by whose stripes ye were
healed.

2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
if any obey not the word, they also may @S the word be won by the
conversation of the wives; 3:2 While they @% your chaste
conversation coupled with fear.

3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 3:4 But let
it be the hidden man of the @, in that @ is not corruptible,
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, @ is in the sight of
God of @ price.

3:5 For @ this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
trusted in God, adorned @T, being in subjection unto @ own
husbands: 3:6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose
daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
amazement.

3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them @$ to knowledge,
giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being
heirs @? of the grace of life; that your prayers be not
hindered.

3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of @F,
love as @3, be pitiful, be courteous: 3:9 Not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that
ye are @unto @,, that ye @# inherit a blessing.

3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they @K no guile: 3:11 Let
him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek @U, and ensue it.

3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the @ceous, and his ears are
open unto @ prayers: but the face of the Lord is @
 them that
do evil.

3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
@ is good?  3:14 But and if ye suffer for @ceousness' sake,
happy are ye: and be not afraid of @ terror, @" be troubled;
3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your @s: and be ready always to
give an answer to @ man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear: 3:16 Having a good conscience; that,
whereas they @K evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse your good conversation in @2.

3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well doing, than for evil doing.

3:18 For @2 also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he @B @( us to God, being put to @^ in the
@R, but quickened by the Spirit: 3:19 By @ also he went and
preached unto the spirits in prison; 3:20 Which sometime were
disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls
were saved by @Z.

3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
the putting away of the filth of the @R, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of @ @2: 3:22 Who
is gone into @1, and is on the @c hand of God; angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

4:1 Forasmuch then as @2 hath suffered for us in the @R, arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in
the @R hath ceased from sin; 4:2 That he no longer @# live the
rest of his time in the @R to the lusts of men, but to the will of
God.

4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess
of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 4:4
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot, @King evil of you: 4:5 Who @ give account to
him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.

4:6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead, that they @B be judged @$ to men in the @R, but
live @$ to God in the spirit.

4:7 But the end of all @ is at hand: be ye @fore sober, and
watch unto prayer.

4:8 And above all @ have fervent charity @ yourselves: for
charity @ cover the multitude of sins.

4:9 Use hospitality one to @F @S grudging.

4:10 As @ man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
one to @F, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

4:11 If any man @K, let him @K as the oracles of God; if any man
minister, let him do it as of the ability @ God giveth: that God
in all @ may be glorified @E @ @2, to whom be praise
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial @ is
to try you, as though some strange @7 happened unto you: 4:13 But
rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of @2's sufferings; that,
when his @Y @ be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy.

4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of @2, happy are ye; for the
spirit of @Y and of God resteth upon you: on @ part he is evil
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
evildoer, or as a busybody in @C men's matters.

4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a @2ian, let him not be ashamed; but
let him glorify God on this behalf.

4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the @ of
God: and if it @O begin at us, what @ the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of God?  4:18 And if the @ceous scarcely be
saved, where @ the ungodly and the sinner appear?  4:19 Wherefore
let them that suffer @$ to the will of God commit the keeping
of @ souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

5:1 The elders @ are @ you I exhort, who am also an elder, and

not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 5:3 Neither as being lords

5:4 And when the chief Shepherd @ appear, ye @ receive a crown
of @Y that fadeth not away.

5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all

God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

5:6 Humble yourselves @fore @[ the @By hand of God, that he

careth for you.

5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; @ your adversary the devil, as a
roaring lion, walketh @+, seeking whom he may devour: 5:9 Whom
resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your @3 that are in the world.

5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath @, us unto his eternal

5:11 To him be @Y and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful @X unto you, as I suppose, I have
written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace

5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected @? with you,

The Second General Epistle of Peter


1:1 Simon Peter, a @< and an apostle of @ @2, to them
that have obtained like precious faith with us @E the
@ceousness of God and our Saviour @ @2: 1:2 Grace and @U
be multiplied unto you @E the knowledge of God, and of @ our
Lord, 1:3 According as his divine power hath @= unto us all @
that pertain unto life and godliness, @E the knowledge of him
that hath @, us to @Y and virtue: 1:4 Whereby are @= unto us
exceeding @ and precious promises: that by @ ye @B be
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is
in the world @E lust.

1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;
and to virtue knowledge; 1:6 And to knowledge temperance; and to
temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 1:7 And to godliness
@Xly kindness; and to @Xly kindness charity.

1:8 For if @ @ be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
@ @" be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
@ @2.

1:9 But he that lacketh @ @ is blind, and cannot see afar
off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

1:10 Wherefore the rather, @3, give diligence to make your
calling and election sure: for if ye do @ @, ye @ never
fall: 1:11 For so an entrance @ be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour @ @2.

1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
remembrance of @ @, though ye know them, and be established
in the present truth.

1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance; 1:14 Knowing that shortly I must
put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord @ @2 hath shewed
me.

1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able @ my decease to
have @ @ always in remembrance.

1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord @ @2, but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty.

1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and @Y, when @
came such a @; to him from the excellent @Y, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.

1:18 And this @; @ came from @1 we @), when we were with
him in the holy mount.

1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark @', until
the day dawn, and the day star arise in your @s: 1:20 Knowing this
@O, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation.

1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
holy men of God @0 as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

2:1 But @ were false prophets also @ the @, even as @
@ be false teachers @ you, who privily @ @( in damnable
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and @( upon
@T swift destruction.

2:2 And many @ follow @ pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
way of truth @ be evil spoken of.

2:3 And @E covetousness @ they with feigned @5 make
merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not,
and @ damnation slumbereth not.

2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved
unto judgment; 2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the
eighth person, a preacher of @ceousness, @(ing in the flood upon
the world of the ungodly; 2:6 And turning the @G of Sodom and
Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an
ensample unto @J that @ @# live ungodly; 2:7 And delivered
just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 2:8 (For
that @ceous man dwelling @ them, in seeing and hearing, vexed
his @ceous soul from day to day with @ unlawful deeds;) 2:9 The
Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 2:10 But
chiefly them that walk @ the @R in the lust of uncleanness, and
despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not
afraid to @K evil of dignities.

2:11 Whereas angels, @ are @er in power and @B, @( not
railing accusation @
 them @	 the Lord.

2:12 But @, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed, @K evil of the @ that they @[stand not; and
@ utterly perish in @ own corruption; 2:13 And @ receive
the reward of un@ceousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot
in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting @T
with @ own deceivings while they feast with you; 2:14 Having eyes
full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable
souls: an @ they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed
@: 2:15 Which have forsaken the @c way, and are gone astray,
following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of
un@ceousness; 2:16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass
@King with man's @; forbad the madness of the prophet.

2:17 These are wells @S @Z, clouds that are carried with a
tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

2:18 For when they @K @ swelling @5 of vanity, they allure
@E the lusts of the @R, @E much wantonness, @J that
were clean escaped from them who live in error.

2:19 While they promise them liberty, they @T are the @<s
of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
@ in bondage.

2:20 For if @ they have escaped the pollutions of the world
@E the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour @ @2, they are
@* entangled @in, and overcome, the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning.

2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
@ceousness, than, @ they have known it, to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them.

2:22 But it is happened unto them @$ to the true proverb, The
dog is turned to his own vomit @*; and the sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the mire.

3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both @
I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 3:2 That ye may be
mindful of the @5 @ were spoken @	 by the holy prophets,
and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3:3
Knowing this @O, that @ @ come in the last days scoffers,
walking @ @ own lusts, 3:4 And @, Where is the promise of
his coming? for since the @s fell asleep, all @ continue as
they were from the beginning of the creation.

3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
the @1s were of old, and the @ standing out of the @Z and
in the @Z: 3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed
with @Z, perished: 3:7 But the @1s and the @, @ are
now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire @

the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one @7, that one day is
with the Lord as a @: @8, and a @: @8 as one day.

3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
@# perish, but that all @# come to repentance.

3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
@ the @1s @ pass away with a @ noise, and the elements
@ melt with fervent heat, the @ also and the works that are
@in @ be burned up.

3:11 Seeing then that all @ @ @ be dissolved, what manner
of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 3:12
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the
@1s being on fire @ be dissolved, and the elements @ melt
with fervent heat?  3:13 Nevertheless we, @$ to his promise,
look for new @1s and a new @, wherein dwelleth @ceousness.

3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such @, be
diligent that ye may be @V of him in @U, @S spot, and
blameless.

3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
as our beloved @X Paul also @$ to the wisdom @= unto
him hath written unto you; 3:16 As also in all his epistles, @King
in them of @ @; in @ are some @ hard to be
@[stood, @ they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they
do also the @C scriptures, unto @ own destruction.

3:17 Ye @fore, beloved, seeing ye know @ @ @	, beware
lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
your own stedfastness.

3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
@ @2. To him be @Y both now and for ever. Amen.




The First Epistle General of John


1:1 That @ was from the beginning, @ we have @), @ we
have seen with our eyes, @ we have looked upon, and our @D have
handled, of the Word of life; 1:2 (For the life was manifested, and we
have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life,
@ was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 1:3 That @
we have seen and @) declare we unto you, that ye also may have
fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his Son @ @2.

1:4 And @ @ write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

1:5 This then is the message @ we have @) of him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth: 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he
is in the light, we have fellowship one with @F, and the @I of
@ @2 his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us.

1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all un@ceousness.

1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.

2:1 My little @, @ @ write I unto you, that ye sin
not.

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, @ @2
the @ceous: 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not
for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
commandments.

2:4 He that @
, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
liar, and the truth is not in him.

2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

2:6 He that @
 he abideth in him ought @9 also so to walk,
even as he walked.

2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
commandment @ ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is
the word @ ye have @) from the beginning.

2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, @ @7 is true in
him and in you: @ the darkness is past, and the true light now
shineth.

2:9 He that @
 he is in the light, and hateth his @X, is in
darkness even until now.

2:10 He that loveth his @X abideth in the light, and @ is
none occasion of stumbling in him.

2:11 But he that hateth his @X is in darkness, and walketh in
darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, @ that darkness hath
blinded his eyes.

2:12 I write unto you, little @, @ your sins are for@=
you for his name's sake.

2:13 I write unto you, @s, @ ye have known him that is from
the beginning. I write unto you, young men, @ ye have overcome
the wicked one. I write unto you, little @, @ ye have
known the Father.

2:14 I have written unto you, @s, @ ye have known him that
is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, @ ye
are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome
the wicked one.

2:15 Love not the world, @" the @ that are in the world. If
any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the @R, and the lust
of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of
the world.

2:17 And the world passeth away, and the lust @of: but he that
doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

2:18 Little @, it is the last time: and as ye have @) that
antichrist @ come, even now are @ many antichrists; whereby we
know that it is the last time.

2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, they @L no doubt have continued with us: but they went
out, that they @B be made manifest that they were not all of us.

2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all @.

2:21 I have not written unto you @ ye know not the truth, but
@ ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that @ is the @2? He is
antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that
acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

2:24 Let that @fore abide in you, @ ye have @) from the
beginning. If that @ ye have @) from the beginning @ remain
in you, ye also @ continue in the Son, and in the Father.

2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
life.

2:26 These @ have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
you.

2:27 But the anointing @ ye have received of him abideth in you,
and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing
teacheth you of all @, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as
it hath taught you, ye @ abide in him.

2:28 And now, little @, abide in him; that, when he @
appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed @	 him at his
coming.

2:29 If ye know that he is @ceous, ye know that @ one that
doeth @ceousness is born of him.

3:1 @., what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we @# be @, the sons of God: @fore the world knoweth us
not, @ it knew him not.

3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we @ be: but we know that, when he @ appear, we @ be
like him; for we @ see him as he is.

3:3 And @ man that hath this hope in him purifieth @9, even
as he is pure.

3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
the transgression of the law.

3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
him is no sin.

3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him, @" known him.

3:7 Little @, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
@ceousness is @ceous, even as he is @ceous.

3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he
@B destroy the works of the devil.

3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, @ he is born of God.

3:10 In this the @ of God are manifest, and the @ of the
devil: whosoever doeth not @ceousness is not of God, @" he
that loveth not his @X.

3:11 For this is the message that ye @) from the beginning, that we
@# love one @F.

3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his @X.
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
@X's @ceous.

3:13 Marvel not, my @3, if the world hate you.

3:14 We know that we have passed from @^ unto life, @ we love
the @3. He that loveth not his @X abideth in @^.

3:15 Whosoever hateth his @X is a murderer: and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, @ he laid down his life
for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the @3.

3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his @X have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
the love of God in him?  3:18 My little @, let us not love in
word, @" in tongue; but in deed and in truth.

3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and @ assure our
@s @	 him.

3:20 For if our @ condemn us, God is @er than our @, and
knoweth all @.

3:21 Beloved, if our @ condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God.

3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, @ we keep his
commandments, and do @J @ that are pleasing in his sight.

3:23 And this is his commandment, That we @# believe on the name
of his Son @ @2, and love one @F, as he gave us
commandment.

3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
him.

And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit @ he hath
@= us.

4:1 Beloved, believe not @ spirit, but try the spirits whether
they are of God: @ many false prophets are gone out into the
world.

4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
that @ @2 is come in the @R is of God: 4:3 And @ spirit
that confesseth not that @ @2 is come in the @R is not of
God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have @) that
it @# come; and even now already is it in the world.

4:4 Ye are of God, little @, and have overcome them: @
@er is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

4:5 They are of the world: @fore @K they of the world, and the
world heareth them.

4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit
of error.

4:7 Beloved, let us love one @F: for love is of God; and @
one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, @ that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we @B live @E
him.

4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one @F.

4:12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one @F, God
dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, @ he
hath @= us of his Spirit.

4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to
be the Saviour of the world.

4:15 Whosoever @ confess that @ is the Son of God, God
dwelleth in him, and he in God.

4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment: @ as he is, so are we in this world.

4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
@ fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love.

4:19 We love him, @ he @O loved us.

4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his @X, he is a liar:
for he that loveth not his @X whom he hath seen, how can he love
God whom he hath not seen?  4:21 And this commandment have we from
him, That he who loveth God love his @X also.

5:1 Whosoever believeth that @ is the @2 is born of God: and
@ one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten
of him.

5:2 By this we know that we love the @ of God, when we love
God, and keep his commandments.

5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
his commandments are not grievous.

5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is
the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

5:5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
@ is the Son of God?  5:6 This is he that came by @Z and @I,
even @ @2; not by @Z only, but by @Z and @I. And it
is the Spirit that beareth witness, @ the Spirit is truth.

5:7 For @ are @@ that bear record in @1, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and @ @@ are one.

5:8 And @ are @@ that bear witness in @, the Spirit, and
the @Z, and the @I: and @ @@ agree in one.

5:9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is @er:
for this is the witness of God @ he hath testified of his Son.

5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in @9:
he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; @ he believeth
not the record that God gave of his Son.

5:11 And this is the record, that God hath @= to us eternal life,
and this life is in his Son.

5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
God hath not life.

5:13 These @ have I written unto you that believe on the name of

5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
any @7 @$ to his will, he heareth us: 5:15 And if we know

5:17 All un@ceousness is sin: and @ is a sin not unto @^.

5:18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is

1:4 I rejoiced @ly that I @V of thy @ walking in truth,

1:6 And this is love, that we walk @ his commandments. This is the

1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not

1:8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not @J @ @ we have

1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of

1:10 If @ come any unto you, and @( not this doctrine, receive

1:1 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

1:2 Beloved, I wish above all @ that thou mayest prosper and be

1:3 For I rejoiced @ly, when the @3 came and testified of

1:4 I have no @er joy than to hear that my @ walk in truth.

1:5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the

1:8 We @fore ought to receive such, that we @B be fellowhelpers

1:9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the

1:10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds @ he doeth,

1:11 Beloved, follow not that @ is evil, but that @ is good.
He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen

1:12 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:

The General Epistle of Jude


1:1 Jude, the @< of @ @2, and @X of James, to them

and @,: 1:2 Mercy unto you, and @U, and love, be multiplied.

1:3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common

that ye @# earnestly contend for the faith @ was once
delivered unto the saints.

1:4 For @ are certain men crept in unawares, who were @	 of

our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our
Lord @ @2.

1:5 I will @fore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
how that the Lord, having saved the @ out of the land of @-,
@ward destroyed them that believed not.

1:6 And the angels @ kept not @ @O estate, but left @

1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the @G @+ them in like

@R, are set @ for an example, suffering the vengeance of
eternal fire.

1:8 Likewise also @ filthy dreamers defile the @R, despise

1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he

1:10 But @ @K evil of @J @ @ they know not: but

corrupt @T.

1:11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
greedily @ the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
gain@ of Core.

1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
you, feeding @T @S fear: clouds they are @S @Z,
carried @+ of winds; trees whose fruit wi@th, @S fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 1:13 Raging waves of the sea,
foaming out @ own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever.

1:14 And Enoch also, the @Hth from Adam, prophesied of @,
@, @., the Lord cometh with ten @:s of his saints, 1:15
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly
@ them of all @ ungodly deeds @ they have ungodly
committed, and of all @ hard speeches @ ungodly sinners have
spoken @
 him.

1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking @ @ own lusts;
and @ @P @Keth @ swelling @5, having men's persons in

1:17 But, beloved, remember ye the @5 @ were spoken @	 of
the apostles of our Lord @ @2; 1:18 How that they told you

1:19 These be they who separate @T, sensual, having not the

1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
praying in the Holy Ghost, 1:21 Keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord @ @2 unto eternal life.

1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And @Cs
save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
spotted by the @R.

1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present you faultless @	 the presence of his @Y with exceeding
joy, 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be @Y and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

1:1 The Revelation of @ @2, @ God gave unto him, to shew

1:9 I John, who also am your @X, and companion in tribulation,

1:12 And I turned to see the @; that @0 with me. And being

1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 1:15 And his feet like unto fine

many @Zs.

1:16 And he had in his @c hand @H stars: and out of his @P

1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his

2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat @

2:5 Remember @fore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do

2:6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the

2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit @

2:10 Fear none of @J @ @ thou @ suffer: @%, the

his feet are like fine brass; 2:19 I know thy works, and charity, and

2:22 @., I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery

2:25 But that @ ye have already hold fast till I come.

2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
will I give power over the nations: 2:27 And he @ rule them with a

2:28 And I will give him the morning star.

2:29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit @

3:1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These @

3:6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit @

3:7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These @

hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

3:9 @., I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, @ say they

3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep

3:13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit @

3:14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These

3:16 So then @ thou art lukewarm, and @" cold nor hot, I

3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
have need of no@7; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 3:18 I counsel thee to buy
of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white
raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear; and anoint @ eyes with eyesalve, that

3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous @fore,

3:20 @., I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my @;,

3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,

4:1 After this I looked, and, @%, a door was opened in @1: and
the @O @; @ I @) was as it were of a trumpet talking with

4:2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, @%, a throne was set

4:3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
stone: and @ was a rainbow round @+ the throne, in sight like

4:4 And round @+ the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon

4:5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and th@[ings and

4:6 And @	 the throne @ was a sea of glass like unto crystal:

4:7 And the @O beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a

4:8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings @+ him; and they

Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Al@By, @ was, and is, and is to

4:9 And when @J beasts give @Y and honour and thanks to him that

5:1 And I saw in the @c hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the backside, sealed with @H seals.

5:2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud @;, Who is

5:9 And they sung a new song, @, Thou art worthy to take the

5:14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders

6:1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I @), as

6:12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, @

6:14 And the @1 departed as a scroll when it is rolled @?;

6:15 And the kings of the @, and the @ men, and the rich men,

7:2 And I saw @F angel ascending from the east, having the seal

7:9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a @ multitude, @ no man

7:13 And one of the elders @>, @ unto me, What are @

8:1 And when he had opened the @Hth seal, @ was silence in

8:4 And the smoke of the incense, @ came with the prayers of the

8:5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the

8:7 The @O angel sounded, and @ followed hail and fire mingled

8:8 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a @ mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea

the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were

8:10 And the third angel sounded, and @ fell a @ star from

8:12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was

not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

8:13 And I beheld, and @) an angel flying @E the @a of

9:2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and @ arose a smoke out of

9:3 And @ came out of the smoke locusts upon the @: and unto

9:5 And to them it was @= that they @# not kill them, but that

9:6 And in @J days @ men seek @^, and @ not find it; and

9:7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto

9:8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and @ teeth were as

9:9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
the sound of @ wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle.

9:10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and @ were stings in
@ tails: and @ power was to hurt men five months.

9:11 And they had a king over them, @ is the angel of the

9:12 One woe is past; and, @%, @ come two woes more here@.

9:16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two @/

9:17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on

9:18 By @ @@ was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and

9:19 For @ power is in @ @P, and in @ tails: for @

9:20 And the rest of the men @ were not killed by @ plagues

10:1 And I saw @F @By angel come down from @1, clothed

from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the
@H plagues of the @H angels were fulfilled.

16:1 And I @) a @ @; out of the temple @ to the @H
angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon
the @.

16:2 And the @O went, and poured out his vial upon the @; and
@ fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men @ had the mark
of the beast, and upon them @ worshipped his image.

16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
became as the @I of a dead man: and @ living soul died in the
sea.

16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
fountains of @Zs; and they became @I.

16:5 And I @) the angel of the @Zs say, Thou art @ceous, O
Lord, @ art, and wast, and @ be, @ thou hast judged
thus.

16:6 For they have shed the @I of saints and prophets, and thou
hast @= them @I to @b; for they are worthy.

16:7 And I @) @F out of the @\ say, Even so, Lord God
Al@By, true and @ceous are thy judgments.

16:8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
was @= unto him to scorch men with fire.

16:9 And men were scorched with @ heat, and blasphemed the name of
God, @ hath power over @ plagues: and they repented not to
give him @Y.

16:10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed @
tongues for pain, 16:11 And blasphemed the God of @1 @ of
@ pains and @ sores, and repented not of @ deeds.

16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the @ river
Euphrates; and the @Z @of was dried up, that the way of the
kings of the east @B be prepared.

16:13 And I saw @@ unclean spirits like frogs come out of the @P
of the dragon, and out of the @P of the beast, and out of the @P
of the false prophet.

16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, @ go
@ unto the kings of the @ and of the whole world, to gather
them to the battle of that @ day of God Al@By.

16:15 @., I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

16:16 And he ga@d them @? into a @' @, in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon.

16:17 And the @Hth angel poured out his vial into the air; and
@ came a @ @; out of the temple of @1, from the throne,
@, It is done.

16:18 And @ were @;s, and th@[s, and lightnings; and @
was a @ @quake, such as was not since men were upon the @,
so @By an @quake, and so @.

16:19 And the @ city was divided into @@ parts, and the @G
of the nations fell: and @ Babylon came in remembrance @	 God,
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

16:20 And @ island fled away, and the mountains were not @V.

16:21 And @ fell upon men a @ hail out of @1, @ stone
@+ the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God @ of the
plague of the hail; for the plague @of was exceeding @.

17:1 And @ came one of the @H angels @ had the @H vials,
and talked with me, @ unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee
the judgment of the @ whore that sitteth upon many @Zs: 17:2
With whom the kings of the @ have committed fornication, and the
inhabitants of the @ have been made drunk with the wine of her
fornication.

17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having @H heads and ten horns.

17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup
in her hand full of abominations and fil@ss of her fornication:
17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the @I of the saints, and
with the @I of the martyrs of @: and when I saw her, I wondered
with @ admiration.

17:7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth
her, @ hath the @H heads and ten horns.

17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and @ ascend out
of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on
the @ @ wonder, whose names were not written in the book of
life from the @Vation of the world, when they @% the beast that
was, and is not, and yet is.

17:9 And here is the mind @ hath wisdom. The @H heads are @H
mountains, on @ the woman sitteth.

17:10 And @ are @H kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
@C is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short
space.

17:11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
is of the @H, and goeth into perdition.

17:12 And the ten horns @ thou sawest are ten kings, @ have
received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with
the beast.

17:13 These have one mind, and @ give @ power and strength
unto the beast.

17:14 These @ make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb @ overcome
them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are
with him are @,, and chosen, and faithful.

17:15 And he @
 unto me, The @Zs @ thou sawest, where the
whore sitteth, are @s, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

17:16 And the ten horns @ thou sawest upon the beast, @ @
hate the whore, and @ make her desolate and naked, and @ eat
her @R, and burn her with fire.

17:17 For God hath put in @ @s to fulfil his will, and to
agree, and give @ kingdom unto the beast, until the @5 of God
@ be fulfilled.

17:18 And the woman @ thou sawest is that @ city, @
reigneth over the kings of the @.

18:1 And @ @ @ I saw @F angel come down from @1,
having @ power; and the @ was lightened with his @Y.

18:2 And he cried @Bily with a strong @;, @, Babylon the
@ is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,
and the hold of @ foul spirit, and a cage of @ unclean and
hateful bird.

18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication, and the kings of the @ have committed fornication
with her, and the merchants of the @ are waxed rich @E the
abundance of her delicacies.

18:4 And I @) @F @; from @1, @, Come out of her,
my @, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive
not of her plagues.

18:5 For her sins have reached unto @1, and God hath remembered
her iniquities.

18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
@$ to her works: in the cup @ she hath filled fill to her
double.

18:7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow give her: for she @
 in her @, I sit a
queen, and am no widow, and @ see no sorrow.

18:8 @N @ her plagues come in one day, @^, and mourning,
and famine; and she @ be utterly burned with fire: for strong is
the Lord God who judgeth her.

18:9 And the kings of the @, who have committed fornication and
lived deliciously with her, @ bewail her, and lament for her, when
they @ see the smoke of her burning, 18:10 Standing afar off for
the fear of her torment, @, Alas, alas that @ city Babylon,
that @By city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

18:11 And the merchants of the @ @ weep and mourn over her;
for no man buyeth @ merchandise any more: 18:12 The merchandise of
gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen,
and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner
vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of
brass, and iron, and marble, 18:13 And cinnamon, and odours, and
ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and
wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves,
and souls of men.

18:14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted @ are departed from
thee, and all @ @ were dainty and goodly are departed from
thee, and thou @ find them no more at all.

18:15 The merchants of @ @, @ were made rich by her,
@ stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
18:16 And @, Alas, alas that @ city, that was clothed in fine
linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious
stones, and pearls!  18:17 For in one hour so @ riches is come to
nought. And @ shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and
sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 18:18 And cried
when they saw the smoke of her burning, @, What city is like unto
this @ city!  18:19 And they cast dust on @ heads, and cried,
weeping and wailing, @, Alas, alas that @ city, wherein were
made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!
for in one hour is she made desolate.

18:20 Rejoice over her, thou @1, and ye holy apostles and
prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

18:21 And a @By angel took up a stone like a @ millstone, and
cast it into the sea, @, Thus with violence @ that @ city
Babylon be thrown down, and @ be @V no more at all.

18:22 And the @; of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
trumpeters, @ be @) no more at all in thee; and no craftsman,
of whatsoever craft he be, @ be @V any more in thee; and the

the light of a candle @ shine no more at all in thee; and the
@; of the bridegroom and of the bride @ be @) no more at all

sorceries were all nations deceived.

18:24 And in her was @V the @I of prophets, and of saints, and
of all that were slain upon the @.

19:1 And @ @ @ I @) a @ @; of much @ in
@1, @, Alleluia; Salvation, and @Y, and honour, and power,
unto the Lord our God: 19:2 For true and @ceous are his judgments:
for he hath judged the @ whore, @ did corrupt the @ with
her fornication, and hath avenged the @I of his @<s at her
hand.

19:3 And @* they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and
ever.

19:4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
worshipped God that sat on the throne, @, Amen; Alleluia.

19:5 And a @; came out of the throne, @, Praise our God, all
ye his @<s, and ye that fear him, both small and @.

19:6 And I @) as it were the @; of a @ multitude, and as the

Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

19:8 And to her was granted that she @# be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white: for the fine linen is the @ceousness of saints.

19:9 And he @
 unto me, Write, Blessed are they @ are @,
unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he @
 unto me, These are
the true @s of God.

19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
thou do it not: I am thy fellow@<, and of thy @3 that have
the testimony of @: worship God: for the testimony of @ is the
spirit of prophecy.

19:11 And I saw @1 opened, and @% a white horse; and he that
sat upon him was @, Faithful and True, and in @ceousness he
doth judge and make war.

19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he @9.

19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in @I: and his name
is @, The Word of God.

19:14 And the armies @ were in @1 followed him upon white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

19:15 And out of his @P goeth a sharp @Q, that with it he @#
smite the nations: and he @ rule them with a rod of iron: and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Al@By God.

19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING
OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
@;, @ to all the fowls that fly in the @a of @1, Come
and gather yourselves @? unto the supper of the @ God; 19:18
That ye may eat the @R of kings, and the @R of captains, and the
@R of @By men, and the @R of horses, and of them that sit on
them, and the @R of all men, both free and bond, both small and
@.

19:19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the @, and @
armies, ga@d @? to make war @
 him that sat on the
horse, and @
 his army.

19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles @	 him, with @ he deceived them that had
received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

19:21 And the remnant were slain with the @Q of him that sat upon
the horse, @ @Q proceeded out of his @P: and all the fowls
were filled with @ @R.

20:1 And I saw an angel come down from @1, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a @ chain in his hand.

20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, @ is the
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a @: @8, 20:3 And cast him
into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,
that he @# deceive the nations no more, till the @: @8
@# be fulfilled: and @ that he must be loosed a little season.

20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was @=
unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of @, and for the word of God, and @ had not
worshipped the beast, @" his image, @" had received his mark
upon @ foreheads, or in @ @D; and they lived and reigned
with @2 a @: @8.

20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not @* until the @: @8
were finished. This is the @O resurrection.

20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the @O resurrection:
on such the second @^ hath no power, but they @ be @6s of
God and of @2, and @ reign with him a @: @8.

20:7 And when the @: @8 are expired, Satan @ be loosed
out of his prison, 20:8 And @ go out to deceive the nations @
are in the four quarters of the @, Gog, and Magog, to gather them
@? to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

20:9 And they went up on the @dth of the @, and compassed the
camp of the saints @+, and the beloved city: and fire came down
from God out of @1, and devoured them.

20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and @ be
tormented day and night for ever and ever.

20:11 And I saw a @ white throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the @ and the @1 fled away; and @ was @V no
@' for them.

20:12 And I saw the dead, small and @, stand @	 God; and the
books were opened: and @F book was opened, @ is the book of
life: and the dead were judged out of @J @ @ were written
in the books, @$ to @ works.

20:13 And the sea gave up the dead @ were in it; and @^ and
hell delivered up the dead @ were in them: and they were judged
@ man @$ to @ works.

20:14 And @^ and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
second @^.

20:15 And whosoever was not @V written in the book of life was cast
into the lake of fire.

21:1 And I saw a new @1 and a new @: for the @O @1 and
the @O @ were passed away; and @ was no more sea.

21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new @ , coming down from God
out of @1, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

21:3 And I @) a @ @; out of @1 @, @., the

21:4 And God @ wipe away all tears from @ eyes; and @
@ be no more @^, @" sorrow, nor crying, @" @

21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, @., I make all @

And he said unto me, Write: for @ @5 are true and faithful.

21:6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the

fountain of the @Z of life freely.

21:7 He that overcometh @ inherit all @; and I will be his

21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars, @ have @ part in the lake @ burneth with fire and
brimstone: @ is the second @^.

21:9 And @ came unto me one of the @H angels @ had the
@H vials full of the @H last plagues, and talked with me,
@, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a @ and high
mountain, and shewed me that @ city, the holy @ ,
descending out of @1 from God, 21:11 Having the @Y of God: and
her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper
stone, clear as crystal; 21:12 And had a wall @ and high, and had
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written
@on, @ are the names of the twelve tribes of the @ of

the south @@ gates; and on the west @@ gates.

21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve @Vations, and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

21:15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
city, and the gates @of, and the wall @of.

21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
@dth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve @:
furlongs.

The length and the @dth and the height of it are equal.

21:17 And he measured the wall @of, an @/ and forty and four
cubits, @$ to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

21:19 And the @Vations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones. The @O @Vation was jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the @Hth,
chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a
chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: @ several gate was
of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.

21:22 And I saw no temple @in: for the Lord God Al@By and the
Lamb are the temple of it.

21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, @" of the moon, to
shine in it: for the @Y of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the

21:24 And the nations of them @ are saved @ walk in the light

21:27 And @ @ in no wise enter into it any @7 that

22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of @Z of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

22:2 In the @a of the street of it, and on either side of the
river, was @ the tree of life, @ bare twelve manner of fruits,
and yielded her fruit @ month: and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations.

22:3 And @ @ be no more curse: but the throne of God and of

22:7 @., I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the @s of

22:10 And he @

22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he @ is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is @ceous, let him be

22:12 And, @%, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
@ man @$ as his work @ be.

22:13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the @O and

22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
@c to the tree of life, and may enter in @E the gates into the

22:15 For @S are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and

22:16 I @ have sent mine angel to testify unto you @ @ in

22:18 For I testify unto @ man that heareth the @5 of the
